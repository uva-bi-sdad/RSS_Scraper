The energy crisis has underscored the fact that energy will play a major geopolitical role and that further energy disruptions are likely to occur, making it imperative for policymakers, energy producers, and consumers to learn from the lessons of the past year.  Actions taken by EU governments to reduce reliance on Russian natural gas included spending massively to acquire LNG on spot markets, leasing FSRUs, and restarting idle coal-fired power plants. These choices came at an environmental cost, with nations returning to coal and diesel-fueled power generation, and illustrate the often-hard tradeoffs that governments make between energy security and sustainability.  The EU's bold policy combined conservation, massive investment to diversify energy sources, and a willingness to temporarily veer from decades of energy strategy to tackle the crisis at hand. However, EU countries emerged from the winter of 2022–2023 with natural gas storage levels at their highest level in years, fuel prices back down to pre-invasion levels,1 1 Gas prices have, as of mid-August 2023, jumped again on the potential for strikes at Australian LNG export facilities.
