A 'green innovation' is an innovation that contributes to environmental sustainability goals, such as decarbonisation, reducing or replacing harmful substances, reducing resource consumption by developing a circular economy, nature and wildlife conservation, or the protection of biological systems. In general terms, green innovation denotes any innovation that reduces negative environmental externalities of human activity, either by individuals or by organizations. 'Business innovation' is defined as a new or improved product or business process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the firm's previous products or business processes a nd that has been introduced on the market or brought into use by the firm. 'Business product innovation' is defined as a new or improved good or service that differs significantly from the firm’s previous goods or services and that has been introduced on the market. This includes quality, technical specifications, reliability, durability, economic efficiency during use, affordability, convenience, usability, and user friendliness. 'Business process innovation' is a new or improved business process for one or more business functions that differs significantly from the firm’s previous business processes and that has been brought into use in the firm. This includes greater efficacy, resource efficiency, reliability and resilience, affordability, convenience, and usability. Business functions include production methods; distribution and logistics; information and communication systems; marketing methods; and administration and management activities. The implementation of business process innovations is often tied to the adoption and modification of digital technologies. A 'green product' can be defined comprehensively as any good or service that is designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces its environmental impact throughout its life cycle. This encompasses the use of environmentally benign materials, sustainable production processes that minimize energy consumption and waste, and product functionalities that support recycling and low environmental impact during usage and disposal. Green products also strive to conserve natural resources and reduce the use of toxic substances, thereby enhancing or protecting the environment while promoting both ecological and human health benefits. A 'green process' refers to a method or technique in manufacturing, production, or any other operational activity that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability. These processes aim to reduce waste, conserve natural resources, decrease energy consumption, and limit the release of harmful substances into the environment. Green processes often involve using renewable resources, recycling materials, employing energy-efficient technologies, and ensuring that products are biodegradable or easily recyclable at the end of their life cycle. 'Greenwashing' is the act of making false or misleading statements about the environmental benefits of a product or practice. This deceptive marketing tactic involves the dissemination of misleading or false information to give the impression that a company's products, aims, or policies are environmentally responsible when this may not be the case. Greenwashing can manifest in various forms, such as through advertising, public statements, eco-labeling, or packaging that suggests environmental benefits which are unsubstantiated or exaggerated.","label": "NA"}
