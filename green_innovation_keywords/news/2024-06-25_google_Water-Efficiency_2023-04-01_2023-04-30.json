Flume Data Labs publishes the Household Water Use Index quarterly, regularly assessing water use from single-family homes in the largest 15 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Analysis is based on data from tens of thousands of Flume sensors installed on household water meters across the nation. Indoor and Outdoor Water Use Flume Data Labs publishes the Household Water Use Index quarterly, regularly assessing water use in homes across the US. Post this The Impact of State Codes on Toilet Efficiency During Q1 2023, the average residential indoor use in the 15 largest MSAs was 38.0 Gallons per Capita per Day (GPCD). Regionally, the range of indoor water use varied by area. The Phoenix Metro Area consistently had the highest indoor use in Q1 2023, averaging 48.5 GPCD. The San Francisco Bay MSA had the lowest indoor use, averaging 30.3 GPCD in Q1 2023 \u2013 the lowest indoor quarterly use measured to date. The Flume Index also shows outdoor water use patterns during Q1 2023. Average outdoor Gallons per Household per Day (GPHD) was highest in the Miami MSA during Q1 2023, averaging around 139.7 GPHD. The Boston MSA had the lowest outdoor water use, with 20.5 GPHD during Q1 2023. Outdoor water use patterns vary widely by season, with winter being the lowest use across MSAs. The Impact of State Efficiency Standards on Water Use Across the United States, state law governs the efficiency level of fixtures and appliances sold and installed in the state. Last year, the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE) published the 2022 U.S. State Policy Scorecard for Water Efficiency and Sustainability. This scorecard ranked each U.S. state based on its adoption and implementation of state-level laws and policies that advance water efficiency, conservation, sustainability, and affordability. \"Adoption and implementation of water efficiency laws vary widely across the U.S.,\" said Ron Burke, President and CEO of AWE. \"The Scorecard is intended to encourage state action by identifying exemplary laws and policies as well as opportunities for improvement.\" The scorecard alone, however, is not a measure of how efficiently water is used in each state. Using data pulled from sensors across the country, Flume overlaid the average indoor residential water use of each state with the fixture efficiency rules from AWE's scorecard. This analysis found that homes located in states with more comprehensive fixture efficiency standards have the lowest average indoor water use. Homes in states lacking fixture standards had the highest average indoor use. Additional analysis by Flume of homes in Southern California demonstrates that the very newest homes are equipped with the most water-efficient toilets and also have the lowest indoor water use. \"Flume's data show that state-level fixture efficiency standards do seem to be having an impact,\" said Peter Mayer, P.E., Principal of WaterDM. \"People living in states with comprehensive efficiency standards use less water on average than people living in states without these measures in place and the data show the newest homes use the least water indoors.\" To view an interactive dashboard showing this data and to learn more about the Flume Data Labs Household Water Use Index, visit Flume Data Labs at www.flumedatalabs.com or contact us at [email protected] .

This is one of 13 student essays posted on the HBS Business and Environment Initiative\u2019s Blog that highlights their reflections. Learn more about this IFC course on Decarbonization and Sustainable Production by watching this five minute video summary. Visit Date: January 11, 2023 At Grolsch Brewery in the eastern Netherlands city of Enschede, our group of students heard about the beer company\u2019s corporate sustainability initiatives, saw these initiatives in action during our brewery tour, and then got to taste their results in an on-site beer sampling. Their innovations ranged from sustainable packaging to resource efficiency to heat and energy sourcing. Many of these initiatives were reminiscent of practices at other sites we had visited over the past two weeks, even in different industries, which helped us tie together many of the threads and outstanding questions that arose throughout our trip. Our class at the Grolsch Brewery in Enschede, the Netherlands. Highlights: Product and Operational Sustainability Initiatives Sustainable Packaging. One of the most surprising facts we learned at Grolsch is that the average beer bottle in the Netherlands is recycled 25 times. Dutch consumers are used to recycling their beer bottles at their local supermarket, which sends bottles back to brewers to be cleaned and refilled with new products. In this way, their standard bottling practices already reflect their ambitions to maximize circularity. Beyond this baseline, Grolsch shared that they\u2019ve recently innovated a recyclable cardboard \u201cTopClip\u201d to replace the conventional glue and plastic approach to hold a six-pack together. We learned that this innovation has resulted in significant savings in methane emissions. Grolsch is also investigating potential alternatives to plastics for its other shipping packaging. Resource Efficiency. In 2004, Grolsch had a beer-to-water ratio of 1:5.5, indicating a high water intensity of beer production. By 2022 they had gotten that ratio down to 1:3.8 and are continuing to improve their water efficiency through initiatives such as reusing wastewater for cleaning production facilities. They\u2019re also starting work with distributors and retailers such as pubs and restaurants that serve Grolsch beers and perform \u201csustainability scans\u201d to increase drafting efficiency and reduce \u201cbeer loss.\u201d Heat and Energy. Grolsch has transitioned from three natural gas-powered boilers powering their brewery in 2008 to one back-up boiler today by switching to sourcing \u201cgreen heat\u201d from nearby sustainable energy producer, Twence, which uses renewable energy sources to deliver piped hot water to the brewery. Grolsch is also working on converting its own biogas from brewery operations into biogas (renewable natural gas). Key Takeaways: Crisis Times, Regulation and Collaboration One of our biggest takeaways from this visit was the extent to which the current European energy crisis altered the payback periods for their in-flight (ongoing) and potential upcoming sustainability investments. At Grolsch and many other sites, we consistently heard that times of crisis can also be times of transition and opportunity because spikes in energy prices can improve the business cases for investment in renewable projects. Another takeaway was the extent to which Grolsch and many other companies we visited were supportive of market interventions by government policy and regulation to encourage sustainable investments. For example, Grolsch shared that taxes on landfilling (which is now prohibited in the Netherlands) and water pollution helped shorten the payback periods of various sustainability projects that they were consequently able to invest in. Finally, another major takeaway was the extent to which industry collaboration can drive sustainability improvements across the board. When we asked Grolsch whether they shared their sustainability innovations with other brewers in the region, they confirmed that collaboration on sustainable technology was a norm in the industry and region, and that they saw sustainable technology sharing as a crucial component of driving necessary change. Our Remaining Questions Supply Chain Emissions. Although Grolsch shared some sustainability initiatives in their supply chain, including a pilot program equipping commercial trucks with solar panels that power the trucks loading and unloading chain, we remain curious about other supply chain initiatives. Specifically, we wonder about the environmental impacts of the raw material inputs like barley and hops, and any programs they might be considering to source these feedstocks more sustainably or increase their use efficiency. Consumer Behavioral Change. Throughout the tour of sites around Denmark and the Netherlands, our group asked many of our hosts how they thought their learnings might apply to other markets like the United States. This question was particularly relevant at Grolsch, where bottle recycling was a big component of their circularity and dependent on the common Dutch practice of consumers consistently returning used bottles to supermarkets. We visited several other sites where encouraging consumer product-return was a major challenge because of the behavioral change required for that industry, hence we continued to wrestle with the question of how consumer bottle return for refilling could be normalized in other markets. Regulatory Pathways. Because Grolsch was so forthcoming about how policy and regulation helped make viable business cases for their sustainable investments, our group thought about potential pathways to similar regulations in other markets. While we heard from lobbyists at several other sites we visited, many of us continued to discuss what types of lobbying and policies might be best suited to sustainability transformations in other industries and geographies. ----- Read more posts in the IFC Series: Deconstructing LEGO\u2019s Decarbonization Port Esbjerg: Deploying Offshore Wind HySynergy and Crossbridge Energy Grundfos: Innovation & Inspiration for Sustainable Product Design Arla Foods: How Sustainable Can A Dairy Company Be?

But, rapid urbanisation and untreated sewage disposal entering into the water sources is leading to the misuse and depletion of water across cities in India and globally. Hemalatha AG - SME - Water management, Embassy Services Pvt Ltd added, \u201cWe are in the era where there is a dire need to protect our water for ourselves and future generations. Water management should include storage supply infrastructure and efficient treatment of waste water to recycle for even drinking.\u201d Ashok Mehra, President Sales & Chief Marketing Officer, Prince Pipes and Fittings Ltd agreed, \u201cThere is no doubt, urbanisation is straining the urban infrastructure. \"As per UN Report by the year 2030 India will have 60 Smart Cities with the population of over one million and six mega cities with the population of more than 10 million. Thus, to balance the demand and supply of water, we need sustainable water management for the cities. Cities like Ahmedabad, Delhi and Bengaluru have already reported a drastic dip in the water table.\" Shama Chanekar, Vice President, Architecture, Bhartiya Urban expressed that sustainability starts with design. \u201cIn integrated townships, big tanks and reservoirs are constructed to store excess water to reuse it for irrigation. Water recharge pits, rainwater harvesting pits and recharge bore wells are provided across the site. In addition to that there are different areas like swales which help to percolate water. So, all these measures are incorporated during the project design. For construction also recycled water is used. Fly ash as against cement helps in reduction of water usage and drip curing method reduces water requirement.\u201d Shakuntala Ghosh, Principal Architect and Partner, Ghosh Bose and Associates & Immediate Past Chairperson, IGBC Kolkata Chapter cautioned, \u201cThe whole natural water cycle which has existed for millenniums, we have upset in the last 200 years. We have managed to completely pollute, deplete and abuse our sources of water. The mind-set towards loose attitude towards water has to change. Current development pattern is not sustainable. We really have to act at an international level, regional level, city level, building level and at the individual home level. Knowledge dissemination has to go across the board and stakeholders from the planners, professionals to homeowners and product suppliers.\u201d NEW TECHNOLOGIES & WATER SYSTEMS Ashok Mehra- We are working on introducing new products which would help in siphonic drainage and harvesting water in a much more efficient manner. They are GRIHA Council Certified Products. We are also designing pipes that can work for low pressure flushing as well. Shama Chanekar- IoT can monitor the usage of water across every level whether its indoor, outdoor, irrigation level or at cooling towers level. This will give visibility of different data points of water use across the property and help in terms of managing water and predictive maintenance of water systems. Hemalatha AG - IoT based analytical systems are designed for flow rates monitoring and checking leakages. In residential, smart water metering monitors water consumption and charges accordingly to make residents sensitive of their water usage. Shakuntala Ghosh- Every premises should be given a mandate to become a net zero user of water if not a net positive because all the technologies are available. For instance water based chillers in HVAC that are energy efficient but need huge amounts of water can use all the recycled water that can then be used for landscaping and furthermore gardening residual water can be left to percolate in the ground. SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT COMPRISES EXPLORING ALTERNATE WAYS AND MEANS OF EFFICIENT CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND RECYCLING WASTEWATER. GOVERNMENT HAS COME UP WITH VARIOUS SCHEMES AND WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THOSE SCHEMES. ASHOK MEHRA ONE HAS TO BEGIN AT THE DESIGN STAGE, FOLLOWING UP WITH THE CORRECT EXECUTION AND CONSTRUCTION METHODS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED TO PLAN WATER MANAGEMENT IN ADVANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION PREPARATION. SHAMA CHANEKAR THERE IS A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS ABOUT VARIOUS WAYS OF SAVING WATER. AT THE CITY LEVEL THE DECISION MAKERS WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WATER USAGE PER PERSON, PER BUILDING TYPE ETC. SHAKUNTALA GHOSH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN WATER SAVING IS LEAKAGE DETECTION. MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF OUR WATER GOES IN LEAKAGES. HEMALATHA AG","filter_flag":1}
