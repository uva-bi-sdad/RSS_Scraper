In the present climate, higher inflation, persistent supply chain pressures, and rising capital costs cause significant bottlenecks, slowing the pace of the energy transition. The setting is also reshaping investor behavior; companies face more demanding calls for higher returns, more disciplined capital management, and more efficient resource allocation, even within the high-growth renewables space. The energy sector\u2019s response has been proactive. A flurry of transaction activities signals a strategic push to fine-tune capital frameworks for the energy transition; so far in 2023, total energy sector deals exceed $320 billion. Oil and gas companies have emerged as dominant buyers, while utilities are using carve-outs to raise funds and recalibrate. As capital markets evolve, only projects that strike the right balance between risk and returns will receive sufficient funding. Regions where stakeholders effectively align policy directives and market mechanisms will be the prime recipients of future investments. To flourish in the face of growing capital demands, energy companies must reassess portfolios, create innovative capital strategies and new partnerships, optimize their financial structures, and emphasize stringent cost and supply chain efficiencies. This report highlights the sector\u2019s crucial capital allocation dynamics and the implications for competitive success in the energy transition. Follow the Capital: Tracking the Investment Landscape of the Energy Transition BCG\u2019s Center for Energy Impact recently analyzed the investment plans of the world\u2019s leading energy companies, governments, and private equity players, to compare real-world energy transition investments with net-zero scenario benchmarks. The study reveals two major trends. One is that energy companies and governments aim to inject an impressive $19 trillion into the energy transition over the next seven years. This includes nearly $2 trillion in new government spending, spurred by US and European legislative initiatives. Company targets suggest a 15% increase in energy expenditures between 2023 and 2027, with an increasing share allocated to low-carbon investments. (See Exhibit 2.)","filter_flag":1}

But the transition to a net-zero future is no small undertaking. BloombergNEF Energy Outlook estimates it will take a staggering $194 trillion\u2014or nearly $7 trillion a year\u2014to decarbonize the global economy by 2050. This presents a significant multitrillion-dollar investment opportunity and is leading to an increased focus on transition investing. Net-zero transition investing: A rapidly growing sector In the simplest terms, transition investing provides financing to support progress toward net zero. This is particularly important in hard-to-abate sectors\u2014like the trucking and steel industries\u2014where it\u2019s difficult to lower emissions without substantial investments in new technology and other improved climate strategies. It is essential to understand that the 2050 net-zero goal is not an endpoint but a midpoint in a century-long effort to stabilize emissions. It\u2019s a rapidly growing sector: According to BloombergNEF, global investment in low-carbon energy transition totaled $1.1 trillion in 2022 (up 31 percent over the previous year). The energy sector\u2014the source of approximately three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency\u2014is integral to the global net-zero transition, with demand for traditional sources of energy expected to continue to grow over the next decade, before ebbing slightly by mid-century. The sector will need to continue pursuing decarbonization pathways and meaningfully reduce operational emissions to achieve net-zero targets. Significant operational changes are also required in other high-emitting industries, such as industrials, manufacturing, mining, automotive and agriculture. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydropower and biofuels need to scale significantly to become a larger portion of the global energy mix. But businesses require considerable support to realize net-zero ambitions, especially if the move to a more sustainable economy is to be fair, inclusive and help address economic inequalities across society. It\u2019s widely recognized that governments cannot finance net-zero ambitions alone\u2014some estimates indicate approximately 70 percent of investment will need to come from private finance. Investors and net-zero transition Investors\u2014both institutional and retail\u2014are increasingly aware of net-zero transition. The inclusion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in portfolios, often with a focus on emerging energy technology, is now commonplace. As companies continue to innovate and strive for positive impacts, responsible investing opportunities continue to increase. \u201cI have seen consistent investor interest in responsible investing. Clients want to talk about\u2014and invest in\u2014sustainable technologies and have conversations with their advisors about this growing space,\u201d says Kent McClanahan, head of Responsible Investing for RBC Wealth Management. \u201cAs new innovations in the energy transition space arise, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of engaging with all sectors. When we as investors work with companies across many industries and geographies, that is when we can help make an impact, leading us closer to our end goal of lower emissions.\u201d On the surface, transition investing seems like a natural fit for investors looking to drive impact in the economy. However, some may balk at investing in businesses that are currently high emitters, amid fears they are not transitioning quickly enough or stretching beyond their business as usual. \u201cGreenwashing\u201d\u2014misleading or inaccurate statements about the sustainable performance of a firm or an investment\u2014is also a common concern. Transition investing focuses on the financial impacts on a client\u2019s portfolio in response to a shift toward a low-carbon economy. Providing capital to high-emitting companies so they can decarbonize and transition toward net-zero targets is vital in reducing emissions in absolute terms. \u201cThe point is not to place blame or point fingers; rather, to understand what data is actually showing versus what we think it\u2019s showing,\u201d says Kyle Bergacker, a senior portfolio advisor for Responsible Investments at RBC Wealth Management\u2013U.S. How to invest in the transition to net zero Interest in investing in the energy-transition and decarbonization efforts is reflected in the broad range of financial products available to investors. Your financial advisor can help identify investments that are suitable for your specific situation. Transition investing can also help diversify an investment portfolio, not only in terms of asset allocation but in terms of widening the investable sectors and industries. This is particularly true for investors who want to consider ESG factors but have previously invested only in companies dubbed \u201cgreen\u201d or are low emitters. However, it\u2019s essential these investments fit with your appetite for risk. It\u2019s also useful to take the time to understand how different funds perform\u2014from a sustainability perspective\u2014through their ESG ratings. Doing so can help verify that you\u2019re comfortable with the companies the funds invest in, and that their transition goals align with your values. It\u2019s worth noting that ESG ratings are imperfect and are regularly being refined. As a result, they should represent one of the factors in decision-making, rather than the factor. It\u2019s important to not only focus on the new innovative clean-energy businesses in the energy-transition space, as these business models are typically inflexible and unadaptable. \u201cThe key is to identify businesses with extremely flexible business models that can quickly evolve from their current high-carbon-emitting operations,\u201d says Bergacker. Net zero is more than an endgame Commitments to decarbonization and net zero are now becoming a corporate norm. According to Oxford\u2019s Net Zero Stocktake 2023 report, 65 percent of the annual revenue of the world\u2019s 2,000 largest companies is now covered by a net-zero target. Of course, there are companies with aggressive decarbonization targets that are doing more than their peers, but it is the implementation at an operational level against which everyone is going to be judging them. \u201cFossil fuel divestment seems to punish high carbon emitters through a hoped increase in their cost of capital, making it more difficult to operate,\u201d says Bergacker. \u201cHowever, it does not actually solve the long-term issue that investors are trying to address by investing in a climate-based portfolio\u2014that is, lowering global emissions in absolute terms.\u201d Investors will also be questioning what returns might be realized. RBC Capital Markets analysis suggests that from December 2011 to April 2023, companies in emissions-intensive sectors (energy, industrials and utilities) that have reduced their emissions intensity the most have outperformed peers that reduced emissions the least. As with any investment, performance must be reviewed as part of your overall, ongoing portfolio planning. The transition to net zero will affect us all The relevance of transition investing is an all-encompassing and ongoing effort, says McClanahan. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an energy transition, but an economic transition\u2014the implications of moving to net zero are broad across all sectors and in our everyday lives.\u201d McClanahan notes that as high emitters are fundamental to a functioning society, we can\u2019t just turn them off; the logical way forward that will make a big impact is for them to reduce their emissions. And investors can help. \u201cForward-looking companies aim to identify these risks and opportunities and introduce new products and services to reduce their own emissions as well as those of their customers. Investors who utilize an ESG-integrated strategy can invest in these companies long term and participate in the transition,\u201d says McClanahan.","filter_flag":1}

Upon its full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households. Bangladeshi engineer Abdullah Arif, who graduated from a Chinese university, is working as an operation shift in-charge in the plant. \"After graduation, I joined this project. From here we can learn and serve our country for the renewable energy and we can improve our electricity demand,\" Arif told Xinhua. He said the plant now feeds 30 MW of electricity into the national grid and will run at the full capacity by the end of year.

(Photo by Salim\/Xinhua) Yin Bobo, director of the Cox's Bazar Wind Power Plant, said the project has customized the \"China Plan\" for Bangladesh, coming up with site-specific solutions for the coastal areas featured by frequent tropical cyclone disasters, poor alluvial plain geological foundation, and low average wind speed. During the construction of the project, more than 1,500 jobs were provided for the locals, said Yin, adding that the current eight operation and maintenance employees of the power plant have received strict and systematic wind power technology training. Yin said Wuling will continue to focus on the development of green energy and assist Bangladesh in its low-carbon energy transformation in realizing the dream of \"Golden Bangladesh\" at an early date. \"It's a major watershed in our nation's journey towards cleaner and more sustainable energy,\" said Habibur Rahman, senior secretary of Power Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, when addressing the launching ceremony last month. This photo taken on Oct. 30, 2023 shows the site of Cox's Bazar wind power project in Bangladesh. (Photo by Salim\/Xinhua) This project will not only provide clean electricity to thousands of households, but also help reduce Bangladesh's reliance on fossil fuels. It will also have a positive impact on the country's environment and air quality, and mitigate the effects of climate change, the official noted. \"The successful operation of this project marks a new era for the wind power industry in Bangladesh,\" Jashim Uddin, Bangladeshi Ambassador to China, said via video link. \"The historic introduction of wind power by Chinese enterprises to Bangladesh marks a milestone of bilateral cooperation in new energy sector,\" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen noted, stressing that China stands ready to help Bangladesh develop new energy. \u25a0","filter_flag":1}

Home to the UK\u2019s first ever low-carbon food manufacturing community, covering 186,000 m2 (2 million square feet), the system serving the new business campus will use the latest technologies to deliver the essential cooling and heating needs for the food manufacturers on the site, whilst future-proofing the industry. Most food manufacturers have a requirement for both heating and cooling to support their storage, processing, space heating, and hygiene activities, and SmartParc\u2019s energy sharing infrastructure aims to utilise wind and solar initially, combined with central services, to deliver sustainable food production. To support this aim the scheme incorporates industrial ammonia chillers and heat pumps, and the resultant energy will be supplied through a 9.8km district cooling infrastructure. This is designed to deliver a diversified cold glycol cooling duty of 11MW at -6\u00b0C and, by capturing the waste heat from the refrigeration plant, will provide hot water capability of up to 10MW at 72\u00b0C across the park. The cooling system is anticipated to provide an annual CO2 e saving of around 27,000 tonnes between 2024 and 2030. By capturing process heat, the heating network will deliver a further CO2 e saving of 3,500 tonnes per year, with potential to double this, when compared to gas boilers. A further environmental benefit comes from the use of ammonia refrigerant in the network, which has a zero global warming potential compared to equivalent synthetic hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant systems. Veolia designed the pipe network, and will operate the entire heating, cooling and high voltage distribution across the 155-acre site on behalf of SmartParc, including managing metering and billing, and provide 24\/7 year-round engineering support. Commenting on this latest project, John Abraham, chief operating officer -\u2013 Industrial, Water & Energy for UK, Ireland and Nordics said: \u201d Reducing the carbon footprint of food production is of key importance as we advance to net zero. By collaborating with food manufacturers we can identify and implement new innovative solutions that both support essential food production, and deliver major cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cVeolia\u2019s work on this new state of the art site highlights what can be achieved today, takes another significant step towards achieving ecological transformation, and helps further protect the environment for future generations.\u201d Phil Lovell, chief operating officer \u2013 Europe for SmartParc, said: \u201cWe are excited to be delivering this pioneering energy solution at SmartParc Segro Derby, which is the first of its kind in the food industry. The heating and cooling network is a critical part of SmartParc\u2019s sustainable, collaborative model for food production. The pipe network and energy centre we have completed will benefit all tenants on the Park, ensuring significant carbon reductions and cost savings. We\u2019re delighted to be supported by Veolia on this project.\u201d By adopting innovative solutions, and changing patterns of production and consumption Veolia is placing ecology at the heart of every process to achieve its goal of being carbon neutral. This includes maximising the value from resources to effectively ensure a secure supply of energy, and easing resource scarcity challenges. Related content","filter_flag":1}

Employing around 600 people in the North East and 5,500 throughout the UK the company has a large facility in Newcastle where much of its project work is carried out. Steve Scrimshaw leads Siemens Energy in the UK and Ireland from the Shields Road site, known as Charles Parsons Works, in Newcastle. He sat down to speak to Philip Cunliffe about the business\u2019 role in the energy transition. Can you start by telling us about what you\u2019re involved in and some of the projects and customers you are serving? Siemens Energy provides technology across the energy value chain; from compressors to steam turbines to wind farm equipment. We essentially provide all the technology needed to generate, transmit and store energy. Our scope covers offshore and onshore wind farms, supplying transformer modules, then connecting these to the National Grid. Our clients today are some of the big utility companies, such as SSE and Uniper, as well as energy developers of the likes of Orsted and Equinor. Our legacy lies in power generation, particularly turbines and just a few weeks ago we celebrated the completion of Keadby2 Power Station with our partner SSE. With our 9000HL 50Hz turbine technology at the heart of Keadby2 this is the world\u2019s most efficient gas power station. We\u2019re working together with partners to deliver carbon capture projects such as the one on Net Zero Teesside which involves capturing carbon from power stations using post-combustion capture technology and storing it under the North Sea. As the demand for thermal power plants using fossil fuels in the UK has reduced and we have diversified and moved into other technologies and fuels like hydrogen, our business in Newcastle has been transformed into an Energy Park where we do transmission projects such as transformers and grid solutions. We believe that there\u2019s no energy transition without transmission - whatever the technology; whether it\u2019s an electrolyser or an EV charger, it needs a grid connection. There\u2019s a huge backlog for grid projects, so this is a huge growth area for us here in Newcastle but also across the UK. What is manufactured at the Newcastle facility? In terms of manufacturing here in the North East, we\u2019ve converted the Newcastle site into a service facility which services existing power plants and their equipment. We believe that the energy transition needs to benefit society and as we more from being in a carbon-intensive industry to a low-carbon one we need to bring people and skills along the journey. We have a joint venture with a company called GeoPura to manufacture hydrogen power units which provide off-grid electricity using green hydrogen here in Newcastle. We have 40 of these units on order and to make sure we have the necessary skills to work on them, we\u2019ve retrained some of our employees on the assembly of these units. The units have been used on projects such as BBC Springwatch and Netflix shows, programmes that want low-carbon energy instead of diesel generation. Is R&D on new products done in the North East? We have our own engineering teams in the North East and in the development of new technology we are focused on centres of competence around the world. Hydrogen is a lot less dense than gas and we\u2019re developing new high-speed compressors at one of these centres. At the power station up in Lynemouth there are three turbine generators and we\u2019ve been involved over many years to support them by making improvements and efficiencies. So we\u2019re not always involved in supplying newly manufactured products but we often service or provide engineering support for existing turbines, generators and compressors. We have some very big strategic assets here in the North East, some balancing facilities, vacuum chambers and balance-pits which are simply enormous. They\u2019re used whenever there\u2019s a customer requirement. The government wants to get to 10 Gigawatts of hydrogen by 2030 and to achieve this we need to increase this by 10,000 times from where we are today. Steve Scrimshaw, Siemens Energy How easy has it been to recruit new skills into the North East? We tend to have a more flexible workforce these days that can move around from place to place depending on requirements, rather than being focused on manufacturing at one site. The majority of the skills we have in the business are in the high-tech area and we regularly recruit apprentices and graduates. And this isn\u2019t just because of the strength of the Siemens Energy brand \u2013 it\u2019s also because of the purpose of what we\u2019re doing which is really important for people today. Our ambition is about energising society and this has real appeal. We like to recruit locally - some of the large projects that we have in the pipeline, such as the carbon capture projects on Teesside, will require large numbers of people, so we want to draw from the local community to recruit these workers. We like to take on apprentices and bring them on to university at entry level as well as giving them technical skills. We\u2019ve got our own Training School in Newcastle and one of the things we\u2019re doing is diversifying from our traditional skills to things like hydrogen because these will be the skills of the future. We\u2019re looking quite deeply into strategic workforce planning, looking not just five years in the future but ten. The government wants to get to 10 Gigawatts of hydrogen by 2030 and to achieve this we need to increase this by 10,000 times from where we are today. And this will require a huge workforce with different skillsets. I started as an apprentice in the Newcastle facility as a 16 year-old and, over the course of my career, have run some of the biggest projects that Siemens Energy has ever been involved with. And my office today is just yards from where I began aged 16! When I speak to apprentices I tell them they can do whatever they want to do, they really can \u2013 if I can do it, they can too. Can you tell us about your investment strategy and what this is focused on? Globally, we spend around $1bn and we look very carefully how this is spent to ensure the focus is on investing for the long-term future. We allocate investment more towards our decarbonisation products and one example of this is the GeoPura venture. This is a great business opportunity for us and the investment will give us about 40 years of work which will go through the Newcastle facility. We have consolidated two facilities onto one site in Newcastle, so we have our Grid Technology service and our Transformer sales operation here, as well as our Gas Services business. Bringing all these together on one site means we can offer a one-stop shop for our customers. And it\u2019s great for breaking down silos within the business too. When we\u2019re all together, we get a different perspective on what we\u2019re aiming to do. Finally, why is it important for the business to be operating in the North East? Our facility in Newcastle is the site on which Charles Parsons invented the first steam turbine so we have a long history here. There is so much heritage for us in the region. The North East has always been an engineering powerhouse and this heritage is very important to us.","filter_flag":1}

Over \u00a32bn will go to the automotive industry and \u00a3975m to the aerospace sector to support the manufacture, supply chain and development of zero emission vehicles and energy efficient, zero-carbon aircraft equipment respectively. Commenting on the announcement, Mike Hawes, chief executive of trade body SMMT (Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders), said: \"[This] announcement is an unequivocal vote of confidence in the UK\u2019s critical automotive industry. Coming on the back of almost \u00a320bn committed by the sector in next generation plants and technologies this year alone, it is indicative of the scale of investment such support can leverage and the result of substantial collaboration between government and the industry.\u201d The government also committed to \u00a3960m for a Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support clean energy manufacturing, and \u00a3520m for life sciences manufacturing. Along with existing manufacturing support and plans for net zero transition, the funding will help to unlock private investment, provide certainty to investors, boost energy security, and protect and create jobs. The government claims this approach has led to \u00a3198bn in public and private investment in low carbon energy deployment since 2010. In a statement, Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, said: \u201cBritain is now the eight largest manufacturer in the world, recently overtaking France. To build on this success, we are targeting funding to support the sectors where the UK is or could be world-leading. \u201cOur \u00a34.5bn of funding will leverage many times that from the private sector, and in turn will grow our economy, creating more skilled, higher-paid jobs in new industries that will be built to last.\u201d MORE FROM MANUFACTURING The government has also published its response to Professor Dame Angela McLean\u2019s review of the role that regulation and standards can play in driving innovation and growth in advanced manufacturing. The government accepted the 14 recommendations in the report, including the accelerated deployment of digital twins. To boost growth in small and medium sized manufacturing businesses more widely, it has also been announced that the government will expand the Made Smarter Adoption programme, offering the scheme to all English regions in 2025-26 before working with the Devolved Administrations to explore making the programme UK-wide from 2026-27. The programme helps small and medium sized manufacturing companies to use advanced digital technologies which can reduce carbon emissions and drive up productivity, and its expansion will also involve inclusion of digital internships. \u201cWe\u2026welcome the government\u2019s commitment to expand the Made Smarter programme to a pan-UK programme, which will benefit businesses across our nations and regions,\u201d said Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS, the trade body for the aerospace, defence and security sectors. \u201cThis is a very timely intervention given the growing pace of aerospace recovery, huge aircraft order backlog and industries\u2019 continued commitment to net zero.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
