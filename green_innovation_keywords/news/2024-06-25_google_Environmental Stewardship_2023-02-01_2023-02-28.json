As an agricultural producer, you may think your greatest threat is Mother Nature or the next wave of pestilence to infect your crop or livestock. However according to some, the greatest danger to your livelihood involves your freedom to farm: Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). \u201cESG is one of the most important issues facing us today, if not the most important,\u201d said Jack McPherrin. McPherrin is the research editor and a research fellow with The Heartland Institute, a nonprofit, Chicago-based research and education organization. He has done extensive research into ESG and has published multiple articles outlining the basics of ESG, as well as its relation to free market. He described ESG as \u201ca social credit score.\u201d ESG is a new method to assess risk of an entity, whether a country, state, company or individual. It involves the interest of investors and stakeholders. \u201cThe capitalist system historically in America evaluated companies based on traditional financial metrics\u2014profit, loss, producing what consumers want,\u201d said McPherrin. \u201cNow ESG rates a company based on climate mitigation and social justice.\u201d What is ESG? Harvard Law School breaks down ESG into its three categories: \u2022 Environmental: energy efficiencies, carbon footprints, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, biodiversity, climate change and pollution mitigation, waste management and water usage. \u2022 Social: labor standards, wages and benefits, workplace and board diversity, racial justice, pay equity, human rights, talent management, community relations, privacy and data protection, health and safety, supply-chain management and other human capital and social justice issues. \u2022 Governance: corporate board composition and structure, strategic sustainability oversight and compliance, executive compensation, political contributions and lobbying, bribery and corruption. How are ESG scores compiled? ESG scores are determined by a group of international organization asset managers, executives and regulatory authorities, said McPherrin. Essentially, those who are invested in companies with a lot of purchasing power dictate ESG standards and scores. \u201cESG standards are very subjective. There\u2019s no objective global standard for ESG,\u201d said Mark McHargue, president of Nebraska Farm Bureau (NEFB). Agriculture metrics revolve largely around the \u201cenvironment\u201d component of ESG. Agricultural industries and individual farms could be scored based on land use or ecological sensitivity. McPherrin also noted impacts can be scored, such as impacts of pollution, impacts of solid waste disposal and impacts of fresh water consumption and withdrawal. Nutrient or chemical application can influence ESG ratings, as well. \u201cFarmers do use pesticides and herbicides, and if people don\u2019t understand how we do that\u2014in a judicious manner of keeping all labeling requirements\u2014you could potentially, arbitrarily, be denied a loan because of a standard that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with your financial health,\u201d McHargue said. Some regulatory authorities utilize assessment tools such as Aladdin Climate, which translates risks and opportunities associated with climate change into terms investors can understand when analyzing portfolios. Another tool is implied temperature rise (ITR), a temperature-alignment metric to infer potential climate change. What do ESG scores represent? Each assessment tool compares a factor against a standard, which is set by the regulating authority. The metrics used to score ESG are extremely subjective and cannot be qualitatively measured, said McPherrin. However, some in the corporate sector view ESG differently. Katherine Collins is head of sustainable investing at Putnam Investments, a global company with $170 billion in assets under its management at the end of December 2022. She said that ESG ratings can be as simple as a checklist. For example, putting a woman on the board of directors or planting carbon offset trees can boost ESG scores. \u201cThere is a part of the ESG practice that is very report-cardy, based on scores and rankings and ratings, and there\u2019s some utility in that, but it\u2019s not important in and of itself,\u201d Collins told Wailin Wong during an interview on a Planet Money podcast titled \u201cTwo Indicators: The fight over ESG investing\u201d aired Dec. 21, 2022. In addition, there are discrepancies based on what is scored. For example, a company that owned its fleet of trucks had a skewed environmental ESG score as compared to a similar company that did not. Companies with practices ranking lower against ESG standards will be scored poorly, as in the truck example, resulting in reduced or terminated access to capital and credit. Conversely, higher scoring companies will greatly benefit from ESG ratings. Another name for ESG is the \u201cimpact investing movement.\u201d Many companies are no longer concerned with only quarterly profit or loss statements; now their portfolios reflect their social purpose. This has been ongoing for over a decade but is gaining publicity in the past three to four years, McPherrin said. \u201cIf it has a good ESG score, investments flow to it\u2014loans, preferential contracting, tax breaks. It\u2019s an exclusive club companies get to belong to if they are deemed successful in their ESG efforts,\u201d said McPherrin. Moreover, ESG regulations extend beyond financial decisions. ESG could control what type of herbicide is used by row crop producers or ban the use of chemicals completely for a producer who enters a contract with a stakeholder company. How does ESG influence company decisions? To better understand the rationale behind ESG, you must first enter the corporate world of BlackRock, one of the leading corporations in the ESG movement. As a global investment fiduciary, BlackRock oversees $8 trillion, as of December 2022. It \u201cowns basically a part of every publicly traded company,\u201d said Wong during the aforementioned podcast. Wong interviewed Tariq Fancy, BlackRock\u2019s first global chief investment officer for sustainable investing who was hired in 2017. Two years later, he left the company. Fancy perceived that the private sector could not control the markets as he wished. He alluded that only government control can fix the problems, can \u201cregulate away the undesirable.\u201d BlackRock CEO Larry Fink does not share his former sustainability chief officer\u2019s skepticism. He said BlackRock\u2019s focus is sustainability not because they are environmentalists, but because they are capitalists and fiduciaries to their clients. In his 2021 annual letter to CEO\u2019s, Fink urged companies to set targets for short-, medium-, and long-term greenhouse gas reductions for net zero emissions. \u201cWe believe the companies leading the transition present a vital investment opportunity for our clients, and driving capital toward these phoenixes will be essential to achieving a net zero world,\u201d Fink wrote. Net zero goes beyond compensating carbon emissions to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cNet zero\u201d may also mean net zero profits for any entity or individual that does not conform to the pressure of ESG standards. Thousands of global companies have either committed to or set a target date for adopting net zero emissions. Amongst those who have made net zero pledges are Ford Motor Co. and American Airlines. Nebraska Public Power District also announced its goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Why should agriculture producers care about ESG? Many farmers may consider themselves environmentally conscience already. However, the agriculture sector is under greatest scrutiny of ESG ideologies. \u201cMost farmers and most agricultural industries affect the climate in some way,\u201d McPherrin said. The estimated global cost to feed humans is $3 trillion; this figure factors in emissions from methane, as well as usage of pesticides, fertilizers and fresh water, as published June 2, 2022, in an article titled \u201cThe overlooked giant in ESG conversation? Agriculture\u201d by Michael Gilbert. Gilbert also states that 17% of greenhouse gas emissions have come from the agriculture sector in recent years. He gives producers the benefit of the doubt that \u201cthe growth of populations and corresponding scale of food demand have weighed heavily on the environment\u201d but that farmers can tap into technology to increase productivity and reduce environmental impact. Those actually scoring ESG will likely not be as gracious to farmers as Gilbert. Who is involved in the ESG movement? ESG is driven by governmental entities, primarily international bodies, said McPherrin. Amongst those he mentioned were the United Nations, World Economic Forum, World Monetary Fund and World Bank. Multinational companies are emphasizing the perceived need for ESG, including BlackRock, Bank of America and JP Morgan. Moreover, McPherrin said the Biden Administration is a \u201cproponent to promote ESG in the terms of some of the actions they have taken and some of their agencies,\u201d including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). \u201cIf they can all ally together in a global system that they are in control of, the opportunities for power and wealth accumulation are endless,\u201d McPherrin said. Should ESG be viewed as a political or corporate issue? ESG is being portrayed as a partisan issue, further dividing the right and the left. The Planet Money podcast begins by criticizing Republican leaders for \u201cincreasingly pushing back against what they often call \u2018woke investing.\u2019\u201d States such as Florida, West Virginia and Louisiana have recalled millions of dollars invested in BlackRock against the premise of ideological investing. To McPherrin, ESG is not a political issue. \u201cIt\u2019s about freedom versus slavery to these big corporate regulatory authorities,\u201d he said. Recently, a new policy for ESG was passed at the American Farm Bureau meetings held in January at Puerto Rico. McHargue said the policy reads: \u201cThe use of nonfinancial factors to evaluate investment opportunities and creditworthiness has proliferated in the recent years, the most recent form being environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.\u201d NEFB has been involved in conversations about ESG in Washington, D.C., and is working to prevent ESG from becoming governmental. Without clear objective standards, ESG regulations within the looming 2023 farm bill or federal financial regulations could be of concern. \u201cAs we look at farm bill payments and crop insurance payments, there is a real risk of onerous subjective ESG standards being put into that language,\u201d McHargue said. Farmers and ranchers had a sneak peek on what a potential ESG regulation within the federal government would look like when the SEC introduced regulations to require companies to submit supply chain greenhouse gas emissions reports within their typical financial disclosure paperwork. \u201cThe SEC rule requiring publicly traded companies submit the greenhouse gas emissions totals of their supply chains, including agricultural products, would have made farmers and ranchers subject to new and complex reporting requirements and potential new liabilities,\u201d said McHargue. How could markets be influenced by ESG? Because of its subjective and sometimes arbitrary nature, ESG adds uncertainty to the market. Nearly all sectors within agriculture utilize forward contracts, and McHargue is concerned about the implications of ESG within these contracts. \u201cWe want to ensure that those contracts are not dictated by subjective ESG standards that don\u2019t have any domestic or global standards,\u201d he said. In essence, the governing bodies who complete the scoring will dictate supply and demand. This is why the ESG movement could reshape global capitalism; it has the potential to control markets and consumer preference. \u201cIf you can force a company to stop producing products with negative impact on climate, you also impact demand for those products because people will naturally be forced to buy different things because of limited availability,\u201d said McPherrin. Collins disagrees. She compares investing and consumer shopping selections to a potluck supper, where you can choose a different dish if you do not like another offered. \u201cLike any market where there\u2019s a lot of new products in a short period of time, it\u2019s true that you need to read the label to see what you\u2019re buying,\u201d Collins said. She added that new products have sprung up as a result of ESG regulations. While Collins paints a picture of a free market with consumer choices, McPherrin relates a contrasting view of ESG for individuals. He explained that on an individual level, someone who buys steak at the grocery store would incur a \u201cding\u201d on his or her personal ESG score, whereas purchasing an item rated at lower environmental impact would boost the score. A higher ESG score equals more purchasing power, even for individuals. But everything impacts the environment somehow, said McPherrin. Corn yields would be greatly impaired without nitrogen fertilizer, yet nitrogen levels in groundwater are a concern. Weeds would overtake fields without intervention, yet opponents demean herbicide use and carbon emissions from mechanical control. How could agriculture be affected by ESG regulations? If you are skeptic about the realities of ESG, observe the current Netherlands farm crisis. Agriculture producers across Germany, Italy and Poland are mandated to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. Kenneth Rapoza illustrates what could happen in the United States if the ESG movement continues in his article \u201cThe SEC\u2019s climate proposal sets table for Netherlands-style farm crisis in the U.S.\u201d published in Forbes on Aug. 1, 2022: If enacted, the rule would require big food companies like Tyson and Smithfield Foods, owned by China, and JBS and Marfrig, both Brazilian, to report to the SEC how their farmers are impacting the environment. In other words: didn\u2019t reduce fertilizer by 30 percent, for example? Sorry, can\u2019t buy your beef. Too many bovines releasing methane into the air? Need a smaller herd. No loans from Bank of America for you. And sorry, your beef is a climate risk according to ESG adherent Rabobank. That means Rabobank might not provide the big agriculture exporters with trade finance as punishment for not being ESG enough. With multiple industries under its umbrella, agriculture could become \u201cone of the most powerful ESG investments in the world,\u201d Rapoza stated. The regulating authorities have different targets within agriculture. The meat industry would likely be hurt the most, said McPherrin. The livestock industry would also fall victim to ESG ratings. Stories circulate about how feedlot producers are not being loaned money because of environmentally related ideologies. If you think this is only in other countries, McHargue has news for you. \u201cMy understanding is this is actually happening at some financial institutions that don\u2019t understand agriculture,\u201d he said. Small to mid-sized farms will also suffer greatly. As Rapoza wrote, family farms will be affected much more than \u201ccorporate-controlled industrial farms that many environmentalists have long opposed.\u201d Part of the problem derives from the solution. In an effort to decrease inputs of water, fertilizers, pesticides and carbon emissions, farming methods are becoming more \u201csustainable\u201d and, therefore, more reliant on technology. \u201cIndeed, some of the most significant ESG-related gains are coming from integration of new technology\u2014better data\u2014into large-scale commercial farming,\u201d Rapoza stated. This intensive use of technology will reveal areas where a farm or operation may be lacking in environmental sustainability. Sensors and record-keeping platforms will \u201cdefinitively quantify\u201d the ESG impact and report back to the regulating authorities. Small farms may not be able to stay afloat and will likely lose funding sources. What happens if an entity does not comply with ESG practices? One theme resonates throughout all the ESG articles, podcasts and interviews: pressure. Companies will be pressured into compliance. Wong mentioned \u201cpeer pressuring companies\u201d in the Planet Money podcast. If a company resists pressure to the metric system, its score will be downgraded and capital or credit lost. How can companies\u2014or farms or individuals\u2014deflate this pressure? McPherrin said that there are very few options for businesses without risking loss of capital, but legal action can be taken. Foremost, farmers must speak to their representatives, he said. \u201cWork at the local and state level to apply pressure against ESG,\u201d recommends McPherrin. McHargue advises producers to be vigilant when entering any contract. \u201cBe very careful when reading your contracts and financial disclosures,\u201d said McHargue. \u201cLook at the statements. If the language is in there, know at that point it may limit your operation from doing things, primarily in the livestock sector.\u201d He added that you may want to reevaluate your financial institution. Will ESG overtake the agriculture industry? Agriculture is not immune to ESG and is more likely a target. All agricultural producers must be aware of ESG and its potential consequences for farming practices, marketing and technology integration. Fink himself said, \u201cThere is no company whose business model won\u2019t be profoundly affected by the transition to a net zero company\u2026companies that are not quickly preparing themselves will see their businesses and valuations suffer.\u201d Be prepared for the imminent pressure from ESG on the agricultural industry. Instead of worrying about corporate America\u2019s coercion, follow Fink\u2019s other advice regarding ESG: \u201cEvery company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world. The question is, will you lead, or will you be led?\u201d Additional Resources: NEFB ESG Sustainability Policy Guide: https:\/\/www.nefb.org\/08\/10\/2022\/esg-sustainability-policy-guide\/ American Farm Bureau: https:\/\/www.fb.org\/market-intel\/overreach-of-sec-proposed-climate-rule-could-hurt-agriculture","filter_flag":1}

Published 02-08-23 Submitted by Koch Industries Innovate or get left in the dust. That\u2019s the kind of thinking that brought together Percepto, the leading autonomous inspection and monitoring solution provider, and Koch Engineered Solutions into a new collaborative venture. \u201cThis is an example of rapid transformation where there was a virtuous cycle to be had with Percepto and KES and our future customers,\u201d says Ryley Clem, director of commercial development Equipment, Technology and Services for KES. The partnership will allow Koch Specialty Plant Services, a KES subsidiary, to offer Percepto\u2019s cutting-edge artificial intelligence software and autonomous drone-in-a-box solutions to its range of industrial customers. The partnership will benefit both Percepto and KES as they work to better meet the needs of their customers. It is the direct result of the kinds of connections and conversations that are facilitated by Koch\u2019s culture of knowledge sharing and principled entrepreneurship. As a director of commercial development, one of Ryley\u2019s responsibilities is to seek out ways that KES can add to the services it offers to better meet the needs of industrial customers and create more value for them. Deeply understanding your customer\u2019s challenges while staying on top of the latest innovations is a key part of that. One way Ryley stays connected to the latest ideas is by meeting with Bill Bender, Koch Labs\u00ae capability director. Koch Labs is a capability of Koch Disruptive Technologies and looks to connect the companies it invests into the diverse ecosystem of subject matter experts, businesses and capabilities across Koch and its network of partners. During one of those meetings, Bill and Ryley discussed Percepto, one of the companies KDT has invested in. Percepto uses autonomous drone technologies, such as its Percepto Air Max\u2122 and Percepto Air Max OGI\u2122 platforms, to do remote, high-frequency, high-quality visual and thermal inspections of a wide range of industrial facilities. Then, Percepto\u2019s Autonomous Inspection & Monitoring software creates AI-powered reports of anomalies and trends to key asset owners. Ryley says it didn\u2019t take long for him to recognize the opportunity that had just been presented to him. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, that fits with what we\u2019re trying to build in our new service offerings,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to continue to innovate and transform and bring new products and services that create value for our customers. Percepto is bringing that.\u201d Bill Bender and Ryley Clem occasionally meet to share ideas and information. Shortly after speaking with Bill, Ryley set up a meeting with Ariel Avitan, one of the original founders of Percepto. The two quickly realized how valuable a partnership could be and how it would allow them to better serve their customers. \u201cThe win-win here is that Percepto has the ability to be visible to a lot of very big clients that usually would take years to build relationships with,\u201d Ariel says. \u201cNow, we can take advantage of the reputation and ongoing relationships Koch Engineered Solutions has with these clients.\u201d And KES benefits by getting to offer a new cutting-edge service to its customers that can minimize downtime, streamline compliance, reduce operational costs, improve safety and help find ways to reduce emissions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create value for our customers in ways neither of us could do by ourselves,\u201d Ryley says. Ariel credits being connected with the Koch Labs capability as crucial to the company\u2019s success. \u201cKDT is the most added value investment we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Ariel says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the money, it\u2019s about the relationships we have with Koch Labs and other Koch companies.\u201d He says Percepto is only just scratching the surface of potential use cases for its technology and software, and the partnership with KES and KSPS will only deepen their understanding of real-world uses and benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to lead the revolution of unmanned inspections that helps industrial facilities optimize their operations and reach their environmental and safety goals,\u201d Ariel says. \u201cAnd this partnership with KES is a tremendous next step.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The first facililty, globally, to produce both probiotics and postbiotics, at the same site, it will allow the US company to supply growing markets for probiotics and postbiotics in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. ADM said the capacity expansion enabled by this build will help it realize its ambition to increase health and wellness revenue from over $500m in 2022 to $2bn within 10 years. A Euromonitor report estimates that the probiotic supplements retail market could surge to $10.4bn by 2027 from about $8.3bn in 2022. That growth is being driven by rising demand for science-based probiotic formulas that are used in dietary supplements, and also dairy products, food, healthy snacks, and beverages, as well as pet and animal feed. The new facility is located close to ADM\u2019s R&D center in the University of Valencia Scientific Park, where its scientists undertake activity including next-generation genome sequencing and early-stage testing of new bacterial strains. Building resilience Last September, ADM outlined \u200b\u200bhow animal nutrition has an important role to play in positively influencing animal resilience. Resilience describes an animal\u2019s ability to respond to and reduce the impact of stressors. A variety of external pressures have elevated the need for more resilient farm animals, including consumer focus on how animals are raised, the environmental impacts of animal production, less reliance on antibiotics and a business\u2019s profit margins, according to a report from the US company. And a lack of resilience can mean higher production losses and added costs for veterinary services, health treatments and labor costs, it noted. The gut microbiome is emerging as a central component to overall health and well-being, with the microbiota ensuring nutrient absorption while also defending against pathogens, said the company, with it outlining how increased exposure to bacteria and viruses can heighten the risk of disease and negatively impact an animal\u2019s health and growth performance. ADM scientists and others are exploring the physiological and metabolic changes that accompany an animal\u2019s exposure to stressors to learn more about the mechanisms the animal uses for necessary functions. The company said this approach can also help find new ways to support efficiencies by using nutrition to accelerate recovery and minimize the impact of negative stressors on performance.","filter_flag":1}

PFAS, often referred to as fluorocarbons, are a large, complex group of manufactured chemicals present in a variety of consumer products, including performance fabrics, that do not degrade easily in the environment and may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. \u201cHuman health and environmental stewardship have always been of great importance to us at Nassimi,\u201d said Iwan Nassimi, executive vice president. \u201cFor many years now, we\u2019ve been on the path to ending the use of potentially harmful chemicals in our fabrics, and we are proud to eliminate PFAS from all products. Given our prior experience developing PFAS-free alternatives, I\u2019m confident that our customers and end-users will still find that the performance capabilities of our fabrics exceed expectations.\u201d While many companies are just now beginning to develop PFAS-free alternatives as a response to current legislation in some states, Nassimi said his company has always been at the forefront of sustainable manufacturing, engineering its fabrics to be PFAS-free from the beginning. The majority of Nassimi products, including performance upholstery fabric Supreen, have always been PFAS-free, while offering the same level of high stain and liquid resistance, the company said. Nassimi recently reformulated the last of its textile lines containing PFAS, called Resilience TX, to create a fully sustainable product portfolio that still delivers on performance. While some PFAS-free alternatives can be less effective in repelling stains, Nassimi said his company\u2019s technology in the finishing process offers highly effective stain protection. As an example, Nassimi\u2019s Supreen liquid barrier fabrics use a silicone-based stain repellent that is applied following a patented fabric-purification process. This allows for the silicone to fully embed itself into the textiles\u2019 fiber to create an invisible layer of stain protection. Likewise, the surface treatments of the company\u2019s Writer\u2019s Block polyurethanes, SiO silicones and Resilience faux leathers provide stain resistance without the use of any harmful chemicals.

A new study, conducted in collaboration with professor \u00c5shild Krogdahl and associate professor Trond Kortner at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and Aker BioMarine, concluded that krill meal and krill oil fulfill the dietary choline needed for growth in farmed Atlantic salmon. The researchers behind this study set out to evaluate whether choline from krill meal or krill oil as part of the dietary feed could help alleviate intestinal steatosis, called lipid malabsorption syndrome (LMS) in severe cases. \u201cCholine is an important nutrient that is necessary for health and growth in fish. It also influences intestinal health. In our research with the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, we, tested whether choline from krill could reduce the buildup of excessive lipids in the intestine, causing LMS, which is detrimental to fish health and growth,\u201d said Kiranpreet Kaur, director R&D Fish Health and Nutrition, Aker BioMarine, and a corresponding author of this study. The 56-day feeding trial was conducted on-site at the Center for Fish Research at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences campus in \u00c5s, Norway. This study marks the first time the unique choline type found in krill, called phosphatidylcholine, was evaluated for its effect on reducing intestinal steatosis in salmon. The krill ingredients for the study were provided by Aker BioMarine, from the QRILL\u2122 Aqua product line. During the trial, a total of six different diets were formulated, including a reference diet with no choline supplement, two diets with krill oil and another two with krill meal, each at varying levels. The sixth diet was supplemented with an inorganic form of choline, choline chloride, at a high level. Key findings The study showed the high and similar ability of both krill meal and krill oil to reduce lipid (fat) accumulation in the salmon intestine, thus reducing the likelihood of intestinal steatosis and\/or lipid malabsorption syndrome. In a similar way, choline at lower inclusion levels from both krill meal and krill oil reduced lipid (fat) accumulation in the salmon liver to the same extent as the positive control group. The krill meal and krill oil diets showed a growth-stimulating effect in comparison to highly choline-deficient diets. Salmon growth was significantly higher in the krill meal and krill oil groups consuming 2.6g\/kg of choline, in comparison to the positive control group, indicating that even sub-optimal levels of choline can satisfy choline needs for growth. \u201cWhat we learned from this study is that choline from krill meal and krill oil is equally effective, even at lower inclusion levels, in stimulating growth in fish and in supporting better intestinal and liver health,\u201d said Sigve Nordrum, EVP Animal Health and Nutrition, Aker BioMarine. \u201cOur findings prove that krill is a functional ingredient that can significantly improve the nutritional quality of the dietary feed, leading to better quality products.\u201d Check out the study here.","filter_flag":1}

Formerly known as Poultry Sense, the US business acquired the monitoring technology from a privately held company located in Exeter, UK in February 2021. MSD Animal Health has one of the largest poultry vaccine portfolios, including products against most major pathogens and a focus on diseases affecting broilers, breeders, and layers; nevertheless, it had been looking to broaden out its portfolio with complementary products and technologies to advance animal well-being and outcomes for its customers. Identifying patterns SenseHub Poultry, just one of many recent MSD Animal Health acquisitions in this space, provides enhanced technology for poultry farmers to continuously track and analyze overall health performance for the life of the flock; it provides users the capability to measure, compare and record key health and environmental indicators captured by battery-powered, wireless sensors in the poultry barn, as well as to identify patterns and trends to predict health and well-being. \u201cThe sensors allow farmers to monitor and assess vital parameters by measuring weight, water usage, humidity, light, temperature, and carbon dioxide. Farmers can therefore gain insight into the housing environment, as well as bird health and performance,\u201d explained Casagrande. Sensor-scales can feed live, accurate weight recordings into the analytics platform. This means any variation or a shift in growth rates can be recognized and acted upon immediately, he told us. Ultimately, through leveraging this platform, MSD Animal Health can now combine biopharma and technological solutions to help customers detect disease early in their flocks, act on it, thereby boosting bird health and bringing greater efficiency to their operations, commented Casagrande. Development phase\u200b The MSD Animal Health team has spent the past years evolving the technology, so that it can generate simple and pragmatic insights to support any intervention inside the broiler house, he said. Feedback from MSD Animal Health poultry experts in different regions of the globe has informed that platform development work, ensuring that the data and the interface reflects the needs of poultry customers no matter where they are located, and that it generates precise information. The platform is connected to the cloud, providing farmers with access to real-time data 24\/7.","filter_flag":1}
