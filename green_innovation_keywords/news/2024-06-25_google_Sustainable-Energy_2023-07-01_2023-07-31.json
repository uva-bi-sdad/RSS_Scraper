States that allow competition are also better positioned to support the transition to clean energy, consumer adoption of electric vehicles, and reduce carbon emissions without relying on ratepayer or taxpayer dollars. A map depicting the 17 states that have adopted retail choice from Retail Energy Advancement League (REAL). It also features a quote from the new Analysis Group report highlighting the benefits of a competitive energy market. The report, \" At the Crossroads: Improving Customer Choice for Products in the U.S. Electricity Sector ,\" authored by the Analysis Group , provides a thorough analysis of different state and industry experiences with retail energy markets, explores effective methods to evaluate market benefits, and proposes reforms to maximize these advantages. Report findings demonstrate that retail energy choice has substantially increased the options available to consumers for the purchase of electricity, played a critical role in the development of clean energy resources, created and marketed a wide range of products that are designed to meet consumers' energy cost management and non-price preferences, and creates the conditions to lower all energy costs in the state market over time. \"While the original intent behind retail choice was focused on reducing energy costs, the benefits of today's competitive retail energy market extend well beyond price,\" says Paul Hibbard, author of the report and former chairman of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. \"It allows consumers to exercise choice, allows for unique product offerings tailored to consumer interest, and fosters innovation that will be a powerful tool in the toolbelt states will need if they are to successfully achieve decarbonization goals. However, now is a critical time for states to get it right.\" The report raised concerns on the methodology used in some existing market analyses that fail to consider the comprehensive impacts of competitive markets, relying solely on a price comparison of the default utility product and the variety of retail energy products over a specific time period as an indicator of the success of the market. For example, comparing the utility short term basic service rate against a 12-month, fixed rate 100% renewable retail energy product, an electric vehicle charging plan that includes charging equipment, or a product that includes free nights and weekends for a set price. The comparison does not account for the additional derived value chosen by the customer. As the report notes, \"These diverse features and the continuously changing components and pricing of retail product offerings make it difficult to compare on a consistent basis outcomes across states, among retail suppliers within a state, or between competitive suppliers and utility default service offerings. Thus, an effective analysis on the health and success of competitive retail energy markets cannot hinge on price alone.\" Report recommendations include having states prioritize consumer education, improve state regulations to better protect consumers against deceptive advertising, and increase penalties for bad actors. \"We stand ready to work with regulators on implementing the proposed reforms outlined in the report,\" said Chris Ercoli, President and CEO of REAL. \"By prioritizing consumer education initiatives, creating a fair environment for competition, and ensuring fundamental consumer protections in place, restructured states can unlock the full potential of competitive retail energy markets and foster a more transparent, inclusive, and sustainable energy landscape.\" About REAL The Retail Energy Advancement League (REAL) is a national advocacy organization dedicated to the expansion and modernization of American retail electric markets. The organization was founded by a coalition of companies that believe consumers deserve control over their energy decisions and that smart regulation and strong consumer protections are the foundation of a healthy market.

Those biorenewable plastics are called PDKs, a new type of plastic that can be efficiently recycled over and over again. Replacing petrochemicals with the bio alternative expanded the PDK\u2019s working temperature, opening applications in the auto industry and beyond With even modest improvements, using bio alternatives could be both greener and cheaper than petrochemicals in the near-term. Plastic waste is a problem. Most plastics can\u2019t be recycled, and many use finite, polluting petrochemicals as the basic ingredients. But that\u2019s changing. In a study published today in Nature Sustainability, researchers successfully engineered microbes to make biological alternatives for the starting ingredients in an infinitely recyclable plastic known as poly(diketoenamine), or PDK. The finding comes from collaboration among experts at three facilities at the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab): the Molecular Foundry, the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), and the Advanced Light Source. \u201cThis is the first time that bioproducts have been integrated to make a PDK that is predominantly bio-based,\u201d said Brett Helms, staff scientist at the Molecular Foundry who led the project. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the first time that you see a bio-advantage over using petrochemicals, both with respect to the material\u2019s properties and the cost of producing it at scale.\u201d Unlike traditional plastics, PDK can be repeatedly deconstructed into pristine building blocks and formed into new products with no loss in quality. PDKs initially used building blocks derived from petrochemicals, but those ingredients can be redesigned and produced with microbes instead. Now, after four years of effort, collaborators have manipulated E. coli to turn sugars from plants into some of the starting materials \u2013 a molecule known as triacetic acid lactone, or bioTAL \u2013 and produced a PDK with roughly 80% bio-content. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that the pathway to 100% bio-content in recyclable plastics is feasible,\u201d said Jeremy Demarteau, a project scientist on the team contributing to biopolymer development. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that from us in the future.\u201d PDKs can be used for a variety of products, including adhesives, flexible items like computer cables or watch bands, building materials, and \u201ctough thermosets,\u201d rigid plastics made through a curing process. Researchers were surprised to find that incorporating the bioTAL into the material expanded its working temperature range by up to 60 degrees Celsius compared to the petrochemical version. This opens the door to using PDKs in items that need specific working temperatures, including sports gear and automotive parts such as bumpers or dashboards. Solving the plastic waste problem The United Nations Environment Program estimates that we globally produce about 400 million tons of plastic waste every year, and that number is predicted to climb to more than 1 billion tons by 2050. Of the 7 billion tons of plastic waste already created, only about 10 percent has been recycled, while most is discarded into landfills or burned. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep using our dwindling supply of fossil fuels to feed this insatiable desire for plastics,\u201d said Jay Keasling, a professor at UC Berkeley, senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Biosciences Area, and the CEO of JBEI. \u201cWe want to help solve the plastic waste problem by creating materials that are both biorenewable and circular \u2013 and providing an incentive for companies to use them. Then people could have the products they need for the time they need them, before those items are transformed into something new.\u201d The study released today also builds on a 2021 environmental and technological analysis, which showed that PDK plastic could be commercially competitive with conventional plastics if produced at a large scale. \u201cOur new results are extremely encouraging,\u201d said Corinne Scown, a staff scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Energy Technologies Area and a vice president at JBEI. \u201cWe found that with even modest improvements to the production process, we could soon be making bio-based PDK plastics that are both cheaper and emit less CO2 than those made with fossil fuels.\u201d Those improvements would include speeding up the rate at which microbes convert sugars to bioTAL, using bacteria that can transform a wider variety of plant-derived sugars and other compounds, and powering the facility with renewable energy.

Something that captures the interest of many, but comprehending all its aspects and implications requires a significant investment of time and effort. SF 6 is a manufactured greenhouse gas with an extremely high global warming potential (GWP). A metric ton of SF 6 in the atmosphere is equivalent to the same GWP as 23,500 metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere over 100 years. This is equivalent to approximately 125 passenger cars on the road for a year. If accidentally released into the atmosphere, SF 6 remains there for around 3200 years. Rising environmental impact The Earth\u2019s temperatures have been increasing since 1950. Over the last 40 years, each decade has been warmer than the last, with the last 10 years being the hottest on record. SF 6 must be handled with care as it can absorb and emit infrared radiation and prevent it from escaping into space. This trapped heat increases the Earth's surface and atmospheric temperature (the greenhouse effect). The energy sector is among the highest users of SF 6 , accounting for 80 percent of global SF 6 emissions in 2019, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Due to its insulation and current interruption properties, SF 6 has been used for circuit breakers and gas-insulated switchgear in high-voltage substations for decades. Although leakage rates in the manufacturing process and during the operation of modern high-voltage equipment are low, utilities have long recognized the need to minimize the use of SF 6 or replace it altogether.

Danfoss claimed the flagship store, which opened to the public on June 29, is expected to be around 50% more energy efficient compared to a typical supermarket with a first-generation CO2 refrigeration system and no energy efficiency solutions. It is also expected to be approximately 20-30% more efficient than an equivalent local store already fitted with multiple energy efficiency solutions. Using advanced heating and cooling technology makes good business sense too, the company claimed. These savings come with a typical payback time of under three years, it said. The store operates both as a functioning supermarket and a development centre for testing new technology. Danfoss hopes it will \u2018inspire food retailers in a world of rising energy costs, emissions, and worsening food losses\u2019. \u201cThis supermarket is purpose-built for the world ahead of us; a world of more urbanization, larger populations, greater energy demands, a growing need for cooling, and efficient food storage,\u201d\u200b said J\u00fcrgen Fischer, President, Danfoss Climate Solutions. \u201cDanfoss has reimagined what food retail stores could look like in the 21st century,\u201d\u200b he said. \u201cFor the first time, all of Danfoss\u2019 most cutting-edge technology and energy efficient food retail solutions are being brought together into one retail site. But the new Smart Store supermarket is only the beginning. Because it will also serve as an Application Development Center, a \u2018live\u2019 testing site for new technologies which we hope will inspire food retailers around the world to move towards zero emissions supermarkets \u2013 while making economic sense.\u201d\u200b The 1,500 sqm flagship 'Smart Store' in Nordborg is now open to the public. Image: Danfoss The efficiency solutions employed to reduce the overall energy needs of the store \u200b Supermarkets are big energy consumers. Supermarkets in industrialised countries consume around 3% of a nation\u2019s electricity production. Energy is therefore an area where significant savings can be achieved by food retailers with relatively low investment and good payback times, according to Danfoss. The supermarket will utilize solar power as its primary energy source, with 100 kW solar panels on the building\u2019s roof providing green energy to support the supermarket operations. Heat capture and reuse is also key to the energy efficiency of the supermarket. Excess heat is the world\u2019s largest untapped source of energy. The store is therefore fitted with state-of-the-art heat recovery units, designed to recover the waste heat from all the refrigeration systems: refrigeration systems represent by far the highest share of the total energy consumed in supermarkets. The recovered heat is reused to heat up the store and produce domestic hot water, with any additional heat shared with residents of the surrounding town through a district energy network. Danfoss expects up to a 90% reduction in supermarket heating costs as a result. \u201cIn Germany, there are about 30,000 supermarkets which have low temp cooling of minus 18 to minus 24 degrees Celsius,\u201d\u200b Fischer revealed. \u201cIf you use that as energy storage that corresponds to 10 nuclear power plants.\u201d\u200b Plugging the leaks\u200b Other initiatives, such as installing doors on refrigerator and freezer cases, will save around a third on energy use, while the choice of LED lighting uses up to 85% less electricity than incandescent bulbs. Automation and monitoring of the \u2018Smart Store\u2019 adds another layer of energy saving. Danfoss claimed there is 3% energy leak rate in Europe, which is significantly more in the developing world. Smart refrigeration case control, it said, saves, 8-12% of energy use at system level. To optimize refrigeration efficiency, it\u2019s important to match capacity to demand, Danfoss stressed. Too much cooling, and you waste energy and risk system damage; too little, and you risk food loss. Adapting energy consumption can further allow supermarkets to benefit from cheaper tariffs. The supermarket\u2019s refrigeration system, Danfoss explained, is utilized like a thermal battery, effectively storing or borrowing cooling capacity in the store freezers while energy is cheap or solar electricity is plentiful, then temporarily switching off the compressors during high-cost peak times until the peak has passed. Industry is increasingly seeking ways to save energy via temperature controls \u200b The issue of refrigeration systems, energy and the environment is timely. Unilever, for example, is looking to \u2018warm up\u2019 ice cream freezers to help tackle emissions\u200b. The downside to this plan is that products will have to withstand the higher storage temperatures. Danfoss said 'Smart Store' products won\u2019t need to be reformulated. \u201cThere is no reason why you should not have several temperatures in the supermarket organised in a good way with good technology and digital systems in place,\u201d\u200b Fischer said. Reducing food loss\u200b The company does though believe that timely responses to issues in cooling units are critical to preventing food losses. The resources needed to produce the food that becomes lost or wasted have a carbon footprint of about 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2, it claimed. The company is therefore employing solutions at various stages of the value chain to address the problem. In India, for example, solar powered refrigeration units installed in fields can ensure produce lasts up to three days longer and doesn\u2019t spoil by the time it reaches market. The store is fitted with state-of-the-art heat recovery units, designed to recover the waste heat from all the refrigeration systems. Image: Danfoss Its solutions also promise to control temperature during transportation to food retailers. Once in the \u2018Smart Store\u2019, meanwhile, it has installed digital, real-time monitoring technology on refrigeration systems and individual products which will alert store managers to problems before they occur. For example, if a supermarket freezer case was to fail overnight then it\u2019s probable that the entire line of frozen foods stocked in that freezer would need to be disposed of as food loss. \u201cPreventing food loss at such scale is critical to preventing lost revenue and reducing emissions,\u201d\u200b Danfoss said. \u201cImmediately when there is something wrong on the temperature side an alarm will out and we can fix it remotely,\u201d\u200b elaborated Fischer. Service business model \u200b But this kind of technology can be challenging and costly for food retailers to retrofit. Danfoss therefore plans to scale its energy-saving supermarket vison via a service model. \u201cBasically, we run the whole building including the energy system,\u201d\u200b explained Fischer. \u201cThe supermarket can focus fully on selling food. We promise to reduce the energy to a level which is lower than other supermarkets and we promise a Co2 reduction per year as a percentage.\u201d \u200bDanfoss is first targeting partners in the Nordics and Germany, to be followed by a full European and global push. \u201cSupermarkets will pay a fixed fee just like if you were renting an apartment including heating. In this case, it includes lighting, heating, and we also own and take care of the equipment.\u201d\u200b Danfoss also takes care of 24\/7 technical support, mostly remotely, but crucial amid a shortage of qualified heating engineers and a significant green energy skills gap across Europe.

The system is intended to provide space heating, cooling, domestic hot water (DHW), and electricity to industrial buildings. \u201cThe space heating\/cooling distribution circuit uses fan coils as terminal units, allowing a minimum supply temperature of 35 C in winter and 7 C in summer,\u201d they said, describing the operational mode of the system. \u201cTo increase the use of low-temperature heat, DHW is supplied at 50 C instead of 60 C, performing periodic heat treatments at 60 C to avoid legionellosis according to sanitary regulations.\u201d The scientists tested the proposed system design over a 5-month period in a real system deployed at an industrial facility owned by Spanish PVT specialist Endef in Zaragoza. The hybrid pilot plant consists of eight PVT modules with a combined capacity of 2.6 kW covering a surface of 13.6 m2, two water storage tanks with a capacity of 350 l for DHW and 263 l for space heating and cooling, as well as a Yutaki S6 reversible air-to-water heat pump provided by Japanese manufacturer Hitachi. The heat pump has a nominal capacity of 16 kW in heating mode and of 10.5 kW in cooling mode. Its nominal coefficient of performance (COP) in heating mode is 4.57 and in cooling mode is 3.31. The DHW water tank uses two internal heat exchangers, one for the solar circuit and the other one for the heat pump. The system can provide from 20 C to 60 C in heating mode, from 30 C to 60 C for DHW production, and from 5 C to 22 C in cooling mode. Popular content The research team utilized temperature sensors and flow meters to monitor the thermal performance of the system and a DC\/AC inverter to analyze that of the PV power generation unit. \u201cReal weather data monitored in the pilot plant is integrated in the model. The transient model is run with a 5-min time-step, and the results shown in this work are averaged every hour to smooth out the results, as otherwise fluctuations obscure the graphical interpretation and comparison of results,\u201d it further explained. \u201cWeekly energy results are also calculated, by integration, to compare weekly performance indicators.\u201d Through this analysis, the academics found that the system is potentially \u201coverall self-sufficient\u201d to satisfy the building energy demand. They also ascertained that the pilot plant shows negligible deviation from the simulated setting. \u201cThe results show that the heat pump COP estimated in the transient model is similar to the one obtained in the pilot plant, with an average error of -10%,\u201d they further explained. The proposed system is presented in the paper \u201cExperimental validation of a solar system based on hybrid photovoltaic-thermal collectors and a reversible heat pump for the energy provision in non-residential buildings,\u201d published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

He is an avid reader, trekker and is passionate about new products and emerging business models in the consumer internet space. LESS ... MORE India\u2019s economy is projected to grow at a rate of 6.5% in FY24, according to the latest Economic Survey (2022-23). This growth is expected to drive up energy demand in the country, particularly as its population is set to reach 1.5 billion by 2030. To ensure sustainability in this changing landscape, the real estate sector must adopt new technologies to make its practices more sustainable, especially as it accounts for 22% of energy demand in India. Recognizing the growing impact of climate change, and the pioneering role that India can play in this regard, the government has already launched several initiatives to promote sustainable energy. Apart from the National Solar Mission and the Energy Conservation Building Code, India also made commitments towards net zero carbon emissions at the COP26 held in 2022. The real estate industry, accounting for almost 40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, has a critical role to play in mitigating climate change. Green buildings and sustainable architecture are the future of real estate, providing promising environmental and economic impact. With technological advancements, there is an opportunity to build a viable future and elevate the well-being of real estate developers. On National Technology Day, here are top technologies that are changing the present and future of real-estate as we know! Smart Building Systems Smart building systems, in particular, are making a significant contribution to sustainability by converging various building-wide systems into one IT-enabled infrastructure using digital technologies. With an estimated global market value of over $500 billion by 2032, the demand for smart buildings is rapidly growing. Using AI\/ML, smart building systems optimize energy consumption by aligning schedules and intelligently predicting approaches. They also monitor building performance and identify impending failures with real-time analysis, making the infrastructure both smart and secure. For example, occupancy sensors may turn off lights and adjust the temperature in unoccupied rooms, reducing energy waste. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can predict and optimize energy usage based on weather patterns, occupancy, and other factors. This is a fast catching up phenomenon in India and several developers are already leveraging this technology. Renewable energy in vogue Renewable energy, such as solar power, has become a popular topic in recent years due to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Moreover, advances in battery technology have made it possible to store renewable energy, enabling buildings to operate entirely on clean energy throughout the year. Mumbai is making strides, and a first of its kind solar power plant to cater exclusively to residential society would soon be operational, and is expected to reduce energy costs by 40%! Solar energy is already being explored for part operations in societies such as for operating lifts or lighting in common areas through solar panel roofs, generally of 25KW capacity. To facilitate transition to renewable energy, frameworks and guidelines such as The Greenhouse Gas Protocol have been developed to assist stakeholders in optimizing energy usage. This protocol also guides developers in adopting strategies such as virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), green energy credits, net metering, and Green Tariff mechanisms to promote the use of renewable sources of energy. Green Construction Technologies As the world becomes increasingly focused on sustainability and combating climate change, technology advancements are playing a critical role in creating eco-friendly construction materials. These advancements span from energy-efficient appliances to geothermal heating systems. One of the most promising eco-friendly materials is cellulose insulation, which is made up of 75-80% recycled material, including newspapers. This insulation material is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to fiberglass insulation, which is commonly used in buildings today. In addition to reducing waste, cellulose insulation provides superior insulation and soundproofing, making it an attractive option for builders. Another promising technology is the development of new construction materials that can capture and store carbon dioxide. This innovation could have a significant impact on reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Researchers are experimenting with various materials, such as concrete, that can capture CO2 emissions from industrial processes and store them indefinitely. This process, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the construction industry, which is responsible for approximately 39% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, new sustainable construction materials are being developed with renewable resources, such as bamboo, hemp, and mycelium. These materials have a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional materials like steel and concrete. AI powered tools Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the real estate industry by optimizing building performance, reducing energy consumption, and promoting sustainability. AI-powered energy auditing tools analyze consumption patterns and provide recommendations for energy-efficient upgrades, helping building owners save on costs and reduce their carbon footprint. AI-driven waste management systems analyze data from sensors to predict waste production patterns and optimize collection schedules, reducing environmental impact and costs. Occupancy optimization tools optimize lighting, HVAC, and other systems based on occupancy patterns, improving energy efficiency, particularly in commercial buildings. Integration of technology opens more avenues of incorporating sustainable measures , such as setting up charging stations for electric vehicles in parking lots, encouraging the use of sustainable practices and reducing carbon footprints. The primary challenge in technology-adoption is lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders, and technical expertise and resources to implement these solutions effectively. However, there are growing efforts to facilitate the creation of industry-specific clusters that bring together technology startups, investors, and construction firms to create an ecosystem of innovation. Another challenge is the initial high cost but there is growing sensitivity that the ROI in the long run offsets the initial investment. A study by the World Economic Forum substantiates that digital technologies can renovate ten times the space of traditional technologies within the same budget. The cost of investment can be recouped in less than five years compared to passive energy-efficient solutions, which may take up to 15 years. There are also tax incentives to builders who use sustainable construction materials and technology solutions. As we look towards a more sustainable future, it\u2019s clear that technology will be a key driver of change in the real estate industry and there are countless examples of the same. To fully embrace these technologies, we need to invest in research & development, awareness and collaboration to create innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of this industry.

Recent research elucidates how this waste can be seen as a raw material for new products rather than mere waste. Protein-rich, edible fungi can be grown on the brewery waste, contributing to food security and reducing pressure on agriculture and animal husbandry. Breweries leftovers are not waste anymore; They can be the substrate for protein-rich food; There\u2019s potential for obtaining biofuels and bioplastics, too; A Paris-based start-up, Yeasty, is also revolutionizing brewing byproducts by repurposing spent yeast into nutritious, protein-rich flour. The innovative flour can be used in various applications, from plant-based meats to sports nutrition. Furthermore, the EU LIFE YEAST project has demonstrated how brewing waste can be converted into high-value ingredients for the food, beverage, and cosmetics industries. This innovative approach could decrease emissions and a significant shift towards a circular economy in the brewing industry. Turning waste into a feast: fungi and flour Dr. Mohsen Parchami\u2019s research project at the University of Bor\u00e5s, Sweden, has made significant strides in transforming brewery waste into nutritious, edible fungi, protein-rich food that can be grown directly on the grain waste. This innovative approach aims to reintegrate byproducts of food production back into the same cycle, reducing pressure on agriculture and animal husbandry. The fungi have already been used as an ingredient in a recently developed food product. Moreover, a new method for pre-treating the waste was developed, enabling the separation of various constituents such as starch, protein, and cellulose, all of which are sources of potential new uses. On the other hand, a Paris-based start-up, Yeasty, is upcycling spent yeast from beer brewing into a nutritious flour that can be used as a base for food production. The spent yeast has a high protein content of approximately 50 percent, comparable to animal-based proteins. After debittering, the yeast is dried and concentrated to produce a powder similar to flour. This versatile flour has potential uses in various products, including plant-based meat analogs, sports nutrition, and the cosmetics industry. Beer yeast-derived flour can be the basis for protein-rich food Grains, hops, and water form the basic ingredients for making beer. In addition to these, a fourth one is also essential: yeast. Fueling the future: biofuel and bioplastics Dr. Parchami\u2019s research has further explored the possibilities of using brewery waste to produce a range of new products, such as biofuel, bioplastics, and ingredients for food production. The potential of these uses is vast. Biofuel produced from brewery waste could contribute to developing sustainable energy sources, while bioplastics made from the same waste could offer a more environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional plastics. The project also looked into producing other valuable products such as biogas, biohydrogen, and volatile fatty acids. Support Us! The LIFE YEAST project, another significant contributor to the field, is transforming brewers\u2019 spent yeast into raw materials of high-added value, such as customized yeast extract and Yeast Cell Wall. These raw materials have been found to increase the speed of beer fermentation, offering another potential avenue for optimizing the brewing industry. Avantium builds first bioplastics plant in Dutch Delfzijl: \u2018a historic milestone\u2019 On 9 December last year, the tech company Avantium announced to the world that a positive decision had been reached regarding the construction of the world\u2019s first commercial plant for the production of 5 kilotonnes of FDCA (furanic acid) per year. Shaping the future: towards a circular economy These innovative practices are sparking a significant shift towards a circular economy in the brewing industry. The LIFE YEAST project, for instance, aligns with the EU\u2019s priority of transitioning towards a circular economy, aiming to increase the recycling and reuse of products. By transforming waste into valuable resources, these initiatives are contributing to a more sustainable brewing industry and a more circular economy. In addition to their environmental benefits, these innovations also have considerable economic potential. For instance, if breweries understood the opportunities in converting grain waste into various products, it could benefit them both from an economic and environmental point of view. The new fractionation process and biorefinery concept developed by Dr. Parchami\u2019s project could also allow breweries to extract valuable substances such as proteins, fibers, and antioxidants.","filter_flag":1}
