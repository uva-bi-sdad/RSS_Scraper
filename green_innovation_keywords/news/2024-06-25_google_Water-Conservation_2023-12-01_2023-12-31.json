Photo by Paul Carter There are countless stories that are a mouse click away that slam golf and everything it is about, from how they allegedly waste water to poisoning the soil with pesticides and fertilizers to handling animals that root in the soil. The reality is few if any of those stories perpetrated by mainstream media are based in fact, and superintendents are far ahead of the curve when it comes to environmental stewardship. To that end, when it comes to communicating the sustainability efforts of a golf, the best choice to convey the message is in the mirror. \"For me, it's vitally important to show the world and our community that we are stewards of the land,\" said Paul Carter, CGCS at The Bear Trace at Harrison Bay in Harrison, Tennessee (at right). \"We sit on 660 acres and we maintain 125 of that. Three-quarters of the property is the residence for the wildlife here. It's their home, we just come out here to play. \"We have to be conscious of what we do on the property and the only way to let people know what we're doing is to tell our story.\" Stewardship is something Carter wears on his sleeve at Harrison Bay. The property has been certified in the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf since 2008, and the course became known around the globe 12 years ago when a video camera perched atop a tree showed the parenting skills of bald eagles to viewers around the world. Since then, visitors, many of them non-golfers, descend on Harrison Bay each winter to get a close-up view of the eagles in their natural habitat as well as the golf operation at work. The eagle cam will return next year after taking a year off to update the set up with new equipment. \"We have the Friends of Harrison Bay State Park who monitor our bluebird boxes, and every Tuesday after the eagles hatch we open the 11th hole for people to photograph and view the eagles,\" Carter said. \"We do that for about three months, those are people who never play golf. They get to see us maintaining the golf course, and we stop and talk to them because we're spokesmen for the golf course. We try our best to put that out there by inviting the community on the golf course and see what we're doing. \"Being in front of people and telling our story is vitally important.\" In Greenwich, Connecticut, Jim Pavonetti, CGCS, is a mouthpiece for Fairview Country Club as well as a handful of other private clubs in the town. Earlier this year, Pavonetti was named a winner of the GCSAA Environmental Leaders in Golf Award at Fairview, which has been a certified Audubon property for 13 years. This year was the ninth time Pavonetti has been an ELGA winner since 2006. He submitted his work at Fairview for a sustainability award given by the Greenwich Sustainability. Fairview Country Club in Greenwich, Connecticut. Photo by Jim Pavonetti Although he did not win the award, Pavonetti did not walk away empty handed. \"I didn't get it, but I got invited to be on the committee,\" Pavonetti said. \"Now, I get to represent golf and the interests of eight private clubs in one town.\" The committee includes a diverse cross section of Greenwich residents, including engineers, local leaders and concerned citizens. \"It's nice to have a voice,\" Pavonetti (at right) said. \"And if they're going to pass an ordinance that would affect golf, I can try to change that or at least talk to them about it.\" Pavonetti sees his place on the committee as an avenue to communicate what he and other superintendents in Connecticut do for the environment. \"This is me getting out of my comfort zone,\" he said. \"This is the opposite of me, but I'm doing it, and when I speak, everyone stops talking and they listen to every word.\" Indeed, others on the committee recognize Pavonetti's expertise. A woman on the committee who is committed to keeping natural grass fields throughout the town comes to him for advice as a turfgrass expert. Among Pavonetti's goals while on the committee is to promote smart water use among non-golf constituencies. \"My focus is protecting water quality and water conservation,\" he said. \"You can drive through my town or your town and see sprinklers running in every office park when it's raining. Golf courses aren't doing that. It's residents of the town are doing that.\" Pavonetti says not to discount the importance of government outreach efforts. \"Some of the most important things in my New York and Connecticut days were to go lobby and sit with legislators, explain some of the bills that were coming up and how they were going to affect golf, and how those bills may or may not be based in science. Legislators are pressured by the public, or the media. If they approve a new pesticide, there are those who will turn it around with no education even though new products are 10 times safer than the old ones that are less desirable. \"Politicians promise voters, especially on Long Island, that they won't allow any more pesticides. That sounds great to a homeowner, but those decisions are not educated decisions.\" That's why, as Harrison Bay's Carter says, it's best to look within to communicate what you do. \"Nobody tells your story better than you,\" Carter said. \"So, don't let anyone else tell it for you.\"","filter_flag":1}

Smarter factories on the way to production Human AM industry stakeholders can provide a more detailed assessment of what the future holds for AM. Most outlooks focus on how the factory floor is going to change with increasing AM adoption. According to Xometry AI is the key to modernizing the manufacturing industry and manufacturing CEOs say AI will play a significant role in their company in the next one to two years. Of the CEOs who have already implemented AI, more than 70% have seen a significant ROI in key areas such as supply chain management, quality control and procurement. But AI or not, it all starts from the factory floor. \u201cIn manufacturing, the often-overlooked heartbeat is the factory floor, where intricate processes unfold to bring consumer goods to life,\u201d says Tripp Burd, Sr. Manager, Strategic Application Engineering at Markforged. \u201cThe introduction of advanced technologies emphasizes the critical need for innovation in this space. As consumers demand more and supply chain disruptions persist, the factory floor becomes the nexus for solutions that not only meet burgeoning demands but also tackle the challenges posed by frequent disruptions.\u201d \u201cIntegrated hardware and software \u2013 he continues \u2013 will stand as a testament to drive for resilience on the factory floor. By empowering manufacturers and OEMs to produce precise components on demand and reducing reliance on traditional manufacturing methods, these cutting-edge solutions will become vital tools in navigating through delays and challenges in the broader supply chain. The convergence of these innovative approaches on the factory floor is essential for ensuring not just the efficiency of production but also the adaptability required in today\u2019s rapidly changing industrial landscape.\u201d Jeffrey A Graves, 3D Systems\u2018 CEO, agrees that AM\u2019s ability to accelerate innovation will play a key role in consumer goods. \u201cAs the barriers to entry have become lower, the adoption of AM as a production technology continues to accelerate. This is becoming abundantly apparent in the durable consumer goods industry where AM was once viewed only as an enabler for prototyping which could shorten product development,\u201d he comments. \u201cAs we move into 2024, I anticipate many consumer goods manufacturers will continue integrating AM into production workflows for many applications, especially in the electronics industry. Consumers continue to seek out the latest technologies that help facilitate how they both communicate and manage their personal lives. AM\u2019s ability to catalyze the pace at which companies innovate will not only enable faster product development times but also enable the development of products that push the possibility of what can be delivered to give consumers never-before-imagined capabilities. Across industries, Graves anticipates that the integration of AM for production applications will continue to make important strides in helping to mitigate supply chain disruption. \u201cIndustry-leading manufacturers continue to realize that AM enables them to take control of their supply chains by manufacturing locally. This in turn helps reduce costs by reducing the number of suppliers and removing the need for costly logistics providers to move components across geographies. This also has the potential to positively impact the environment by minimizing manufacturers\u2019 carbon footprints,\u201d he concludes. For Bart Van der Schueren, Chief Technology Officer at Materialise, there will be a divided path to 3D printing production among manufacturers. The company expects two clearly defined paths to co-exist depending on customers\u2019 needs. The first, more traditional model of working with service bureaus for quick, cost-efficient printing will continue to thrive through production for prototypes and other one-off parts. However, with 3D printing\u2019s use growing in production, it\u2019s likely more manufacturers will shift toward bringing 3D printing knowledge in-house to produce end-use parts at scale. If manufacturers can bridge the knowledge gap, this second path will help innovators design for AM and optimize unique 3D printing processes for their specific applications. Matteo Carola, Country Manager Italy at Protolabs, looks even more specifically at the role that technologies such as AI, 5G and IoT will increasingly play in 2024. \u201cWe will witness a greater transition towards smart factories, with increased integration of AI, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, and cloud computing,\u201d he explains. This will result in benefits such as cost reduction, improved product quality, enhanced security, and sustainability. \u201c2023 was a record year for 3D printer installations \u2013 Carola adds \u2013 and the market is set to benefit from the efficiency, speed, and accessibility that AI will bring. Prototyping remains the primary application of 3D printing, but we are witnessing an increase in the production of end-use parts, especially with additive manufacturing of metals (AM), which means it will continue to grow as a full-fledged production method. The applications of Artificial Intelligence are expected to further improve, enabling the detection and correction of errors before they occur, saving time and enhancing safety. Specific programs like ChatGPT simplify the design process through voice commands, rather than requiring coding for programming the geometric complexities of a project,\u201d Carola points out. AI and AM are not however expected to take away jobs. Construction 3D printing company Mighty Buildings\u2019 CEO Scott Gebicke says that \u201cwe won\u2019t yet see AI affect jobs onsite or in the factory.\u201d Rather, \u201cwe\u2019ll see new tools to support workers, but nothing that will rapidly shift the labor force that is actively doing the building. The integration of AI tools will focus on improving efficiency, safety, and decision-making processes, complementing the skills of on-site and factory workers.\u201d Manufacturing was on the cusp of a labor crisis even before COVID-19. Now going on four years post-pandemic, the manufacturing job market has improved according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and there remains a shortage of over 600,000 manufacturing jobs waiting to be filled. CEOs remain worried about attracting highly skilled talent as American manufacturing becomes more high-tech. According to Xometry\u2019s own research, more than half (56%) of CEOs said they struggle to find qualified employees in today\u2019s tight labor market. A shared, distributed and sustainable economy Others point out AM\u2019s potential to create a more shared, distributed and sustainable economy. According to a Xometry survey, reshoring will continue to trend upwards with 76% of manufacturing CEOs having successfully reshored some or all of their operations throughout 2023 \u2013 a move accelerated by federal tax incentives and initiatives such as \u201cBuild America, Buy America.\u201d For Shai Terem, CEO of Markforged, \u201cThe intersection of manufacturing and the sharing economy is poised to redefine traditional production models and reshape the industrial landscape as a peer-to-peer model. Facilities with parts in inventory are ideal resources for other OEMs to use. Keeping an extensive physical inventory ties up capital in parts that may go untouched for years.\u201d The ability to transform parts into collaborative production hubs will pave the way for the future of distributed manufacturing. This involves integrating 3D printing with a digitized platform, allowing parts to be uploaded and printed at the time and point of need without the need to be manufactured in advance, shipped, and stored until needed. Terem concludes that the result will be a move away from mass production towards more personalized, on-demand manufacturing and delivery of end-to-end process control. \u201cThe future of manufacturing in the sharing economy market \u2013 he argues \u2013 will create a more sustainable and connected ecosystem after years of manufacturers feeling divided by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions.\u201d Henrike Wonneberger, Co-founder and COO of Replique, believes that 2024 will be the year to reduce tied-up capital to stay competitive. \u201cCompanies have to analyze processes that are not efficient,\u201d he says. \u201cThis involves a critical analysis of inefficient processes, with a keen focus on minimizing storage costs, which often constitute up to 20% of overall part expenses. Evolving to a digital warehouse with on-demand manufacturing can be a huge opportunity. That eliminates the necessity for extensive physical inventories, ensuring that businesses can adapt to economic fluctuations swiftly and efficiently.\u201d Wonneberger continues: \u201c[This] also enables companies to produce decentral via a connected production network \u2013 just when parts are needed without minimum order quantities. This approach leads to higher flexibility and cost-efficiency, as well as a more sustainable supply chain. The success of this platform hinges on its fulfilment of industrial standards, emphasizing not only data security but, most importantly, data integrity. Uniforming quality across parts, regardless of their production location, will be a key consideration.\u201d Manufacturing products as close as possible to the point of use has multiple advantages. Firstly, it addresses the need for greater sustainability by avoiding long journeys of parts and products, and it helps organizations manage supply chain uncertainty. While not always feasible due to resources, expertise, and supplies, working with local facilities or suppliers allows companies to be more flexible and responsive to changing customer needs and market trends. Matt Carola of Protolabs believes that manufacturers will increasingly adopt a hybrid approach that involves both a centralized facility and a network of more local facilities to meet their needs. \u201cFollowing the pandemic, with ongoing uncertainty about supply routes and energy sources due to recent geopolitical tensions, there is a growing phenomenon known as \u2018friend-shoring\u2019 \u2013 Carola says \u2013 where countries move their supply chains and production to a country with similar values and culture. In our research, 55% of those exploring supply chain restructuring have focused on friend-shoring. Vertical consolidation is also becoming a way to overcome supply chain challenges, particularly in the aerospace sector. Organizations want greater control over the quality and capacity level of the supply chain, especially with emerging technologies like hydrogen. Both options mean that companies want to be sure about the source of energy, occupational ethics, and recycling and waste disposal standards. And that brings us to the topic of sustainability in manufacturing. Many companies are increasingly focusing on a net-zero emissions future and taking proactive action to limit their greenhouse gas emissions across their industrial supply chains. According to the Xometry survey mentioned earlier, \u201cFifty-two percent of CEOs view climate change as an existential threat caused by human activity.\u201d The company expects that 2024 will see the actualization of companies making sustainability a business goal with more investment in measuring and tracking tools to prioritize decarbonization of their operations. Scott Gebicke, CEO of Mighty Buildings, brings his point of view concerning the rapidly growing segment of construction 3D printing. Looking at general concerns, he expects that water conservation and embodied carbon will take center stage in sustainability conversations, as extreme weather events grow in frequency. \u201cEnergy efficiency has been the focus of conversations, regulations, and incentives in recent years \u2013 he says \u2013 however, the impact of embodied carbon (the materials we use to build) and water conservation are becoming clearer, and we expect to see a surge in financial, insurance, and regulatory incentives aimed at promoting water conservation and sustainable materials. Notable legislative actions in 2023 set the precedent: Florida introduced significant tax credits for greywater systems (under statute 220.199); Arizona implemented restrictions on new building permits in areas lacking adequate groundwater; Europe is requiring stricter emissions reporting from large companies.\u201d Getting back to the world of industrial manufacturing, Protolabs\u2019 Matteo Carola sees sustainability as still a top priority in the manufacturing industry, both concerning organizations\u2019 processes and the products they create. \u201cSectors such as aerospace, automotive, and energy have legislative goals to achieve, such as reaching Net Zero by 2050,\u201d he says, \u201cso much of their product development is focused on decarbonization and the incorporation of ultra-efficient technologies. Our study of 450 manufacturing industry executives demonstrates that sustainability is a key driver of innovation and a fundamental reason why manufacturers develop new products. Digital manufacturing plays an important role as it enables localized production and reduces waste.\u201d New opportunities for AM in 2024 So what does it all boil down to? What will smarter, more distributed, and more sustainable AM factories be used to produce in 2024? Reji Puthenveetil EVP, Industrial Solutions at 3D Systems, argues that AM is already demonstrating its ability to transform manufacturing workflows for a variety of industrial applications. \u201cWe continue to see advancements in casting and aerospace, as well as oil and gas. However, as we enter 2024, I believe we\u2019re going to see AM play an increasingly important role in two industries \u2013 semiconductors and durable consumer goods. Semiconductor lithography and wafer processing equipment require constant innovation to meet the accuracy, speed, reliability, and productivity demands of increasingly complex microchip production. Additionally, the continual need for increased quality improved total cost of ownership, reduced time to market, and minimized supply chain disruption persists.\u201d Among other key developments, while the automotive industry is primed for growth and innovation in 2024, EV manufacturers may be taking their foot off of the accelerator when it comes to electric vehicles. Xometry\u2019s Automotive Survey found that 84% of automotive executives said current production timelines and waning consumer demand may make it difficult for the industry to meet the Biden Administration\u2019s goals for the year ahead. Among auto executives\u2019 chief concerns: are battery innovation, charger compatibility and slowing consumer adoption, according to the survey. According to Protolabs\u2019 Report on the State of Robotic Production 2023, soft robotics and new materials will have the greatest impact on the development of robotic production in the next five years. Soft robotics, such as grippers that enable robots to perform more logistical tasks, are expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 35.1% between 2022 and 2027, with benefits for biomedicine, food, and agriculture. The use of new materials and technologies requires various iterations for testing and refinement, which is why digital manufacturing becomes a key element in accelerating the development cycle. Protolabs Matteo Carola expects an upsurge of new materials being introduced in modeling systems, a process known as 4D printing. By using reactive materials that respond to external elements like heat, light, humidity, electric current, or pressure, 4D-printed objects can change shape or properties. For example in the aerospace industry 4D printed drone wings that can bend up to 20 degrees in response to stimuli, significantly improving efficiency. In Medtech, 4D printed implants that adapt to the patient\u2019s body over time. Smart fabrics could regulate their breathability based on humidity and hydraulic system components that expand or contract in response to temperature fluctuations. In more short term, Materialise CTO Bart Van der Schueren expects a rise in mid-range printer technologies to reach a new customer segment in the coming year. \u201cWhile machine offerings have traditionally fallen in either the hobbyist or industrial category \u2013 he says \u2013 mid-range printers tuned to excel in an application range between these two can open new doors for 3D printing parts such as tools and jigs in the automotive industry. Finally, as we look ahead to 2024, Henrike Wonneberger of Replique, expects that the AM industry is poised for growth and maturation. \u201cWe are observing a growing awareness among companies regarding the significance of 3D printing, and it is about time for its seamless integration as a primary production method for small to mid-volume series, starting right from the initial design phase. \u201cNotably \u2013 he adds \u2013 among the existing service providers, a trend towards market consolidation is evident. Centralized platforms are expected to play a key role, offering companies a unified interface for various services\u2014addressing the industry\u2019s challenge of fragmentation. This move towards decentralization aims not only for scalability but also a more collaborative, transparent, and efficient supply chain.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}

This evolution isn't just about e-commerce overtaking modern trade; it's also about the transformation of general trade channels, as kiranas in urban areas are likely to adopt more modern store-like appearances, embracing digital payments and direct ordering from FMCG brands. Significantly, direct ordering and e-commerce platforms have fueled substantial sales growth for FMCG companies, such as Hindustan Unilever and Tata Consumer, where digital sales accounted for a substantial portion of their revenue. Additionally, collaborations with various digital platforms offer increased coverage for deliveries, convenient options, and access to products that might be challenging to find offline, intensifying the appeal of FMCG businesses in the digital real. Finally, the social commerce channel will see robust growth in the coming years, recording a CAGR of 62.4% during 2022-2028: as the number of internet and social media users surges. Social media will likely become a vital shopping platform as they allow for more customized offers and target-specific ads, thanks to the high volume of user data collected by social media apps. Trend 5: Industry structure gets shaped by new and existing players The FMCG industry is going through a structural change with the entry of the new type of players and consolidation by the incumbent players, In particular, three types of players are emerging: Mavericks - companies with a completely non-traditional background, scalers- those to spread their wings beyond their private labels and acquirers, looking to consolidate their position further. Mavericks On the sidelines until a decade, Patanjali has seen a meteoric rise since then. The company\u2019s Food and FMCG business revenue jumped almost four-fold to \u20b96,218 crore in the 2022-23 fiscal, from \u20b91,683 crore in the previous year. The company has grown with a different business model on the back of natural products. As it prepares for the next stage of growth through listing multiple companies, the industry will witness a new type of competition to deal with. Scalers Reliance also announced its plans to enter the FMCG market earlier this year, focusing on small packs grocery segments, with diversification plans coming gradually. Reliance\u2019s entry into the FMCG market will be through M&A, with plans on acquiring multiple FMCG brands to accompany its developing modern trade stores; these possible acquisitions include F&B brands Garden Namkeens, Lahori Zeera and Bindu Beverages. Acquirers As new firms continue to reshape the market, existing FMCG players have merged with or acquired other brands to enter new markets or to increase their portfolios in areas where they are already present. For example, Nestle India bought Purina Care India, and Emami bought 30% of pet care startup Canis Lupus Services India. Trend 6: Millennials and GenZ become the main actors As Gen Z and Millenials account for a growing part of the population estimated to comprise 50% of India's population by 2030), their consumption habits and preferences are becoming mainstream. Among them is a liking for quick deliveries and convenience, an increasing digital savviness and a desire for healthier products. The requirement for quick deliveries is especially true for the convenience of having the product delivered at home or available at your doorstep; after having experienced these new channels during the pandemic, the consumers are more likely to use them than post-pandemic. Especially for groceries, 42 per cent of shoppers across all age groups, say that delivery and fulfilment are the most important service attributes. Millennials and Gen Z are also far more challenging to reach through old-fashioned marketing campaigns: 84% of Millennials don\u2019t trust traditional advertising; they are far more sensitive to experiences than hard sells. Gen-Z consumers are far more sensitive to money-saving opportunities (as they are less confident about the future and tend to check their bank balance more frequently) and socially and environmentally engaged companies. 61% of Gen Zs believe brands are better positioned than governments to solve social problems. They also prefer buying Indian products: 92% of Indians have reported purchasing local products over imported ones. More consumers will compare different options before buying, thanks to the increased online information. They will also be more attentive to the information displayed on the packaging (\u201cknowing before buying\u201d behaviour) In B2C, 81% of customers research online before buying non-routine items, while in B2B, 92% of purchasing decisions commence with an online digital search. Health will remain a consumer concern in the FMCG Market: in F&B, dietary preferences will shift towards organic\/vegan products, driving sales of health & nutrition-focus brands. Consumers will prefer branded products as they are perceived to be associated with better quality, safety and health benefits. Forty four per cent of consumers are willing to pay a premium for grocery products that have sustainable packaging. This is more pronounced amongst Gen Z (64 per cent) and millennials (54 per cent) than older generations like boomers (30 per cent). Trend 7: Consumers to get older and wealthier By the year 2050, India will have a notably larger mid-age population. They will likely have more purchasing power (being a family and not single households) and will buy according to their life-cycle stages: couples typically buy more durable goods, parents buy children or family-related products, and their expenses in-home care\/ personal care increase towards family-sized packs; finally when children leave the nest, the revenue of the parents stabilize, and they can spend more on luxury\/health related items.","filter_flag":1}

Answer: Growth 1. Growth is quantitative and value-neutral in nature. 2. Growth is a narrower concept that comprises a singular variable. Development 1. Development is qualitative and positive in nature. 2. Development is a comprehensive and wider concept that comprises multiple variables. Eg. If a country experiences a significant increase in its GDP, it indicates economic growth. However, if the majority of the population continues to face poverty, lack of quality education, inadequate healthcare, etc., then this growth is not accompanied by development. \u2013 any other point\/example (to be assessed as a whole) OR Territory size and per capita income do not alone determine human development levels in nations. \u2013 Smaller countries often outperform larger ones in terms of human development such as in the case of Bhutan performing better than its much larger neighbor, India. \u2013 It is possible that Bhutan does better than India when it comes to income equality, quality of education and healthcare, environmental sustainability, gender equality, etc. which gets it a better rank. \u2013 any other relevant point (to be assessed as a whole) Answer21. \u2013 The quote means that if development does not include the empowerment of women, it is not sustainable.

Answer the following questions with respect to the evolution of Geography as a discipline: a) In the 1970s, why was there discontentment with the quantitative revolution in Geography, which aimed to bring more scientific rigor and mathematical modeling to geographic research? b) How did this discontentment influence the further approaches to the discipline in the years ahead? Explain the transition with an example. Answer: (a) Neglect of qualitative approaches The emphasis on quantitative analysis led to a neglect of qualitative methods which provide in-depth insights and contextual understanding, which many geographers felt were essential for capturing the complexities of human experiences and cultural dynamics. Lack of critical and theoretical perspectives The quantitative revolution was criticized for its limited attention to critical and theoretical frameworks and primary focus on empirical analysis and statistical techniques, overlooking the broader social, political, and economic contexts in which geographic processes occur. \u2013 any other relevant point (award one mark for each point) Integration of Multiple Approaches: Over time, there has been a move towards integrating quantitative and qualitative methods in geography. Researchers recognize the value of both approaches and seek to combine them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of geographic phenomena. Interdisciplinary collaboration to address complex geographic issues: This shift led to fruitful interactions with other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, environmental studies, and urban planning. By integrating diverse perspectives, geographers sought to develop more comprehensive and nuanced analyses of spatial phenomena. The emergence of new approaches: It led to the emergence of humanistic, radical, and behavioral schools and introduced post-modernism approaches to geography. \u2013 For example, it led to the emergence of Social geography. This branch shifted the focus to understanding the social aspects of human spaces, emphasizing the relationships between people and their spatial behaviors. This transition brought attention to the social complexities and human experiences within geographical spaces, recognizing cities and landscapes as products of human interactions, cultural practices, and social institutions. \u2013 any other relevant point (to be assessed as a whole) Q23. \u2018Outsourcing is coming to those countries where cheap and skilled workers are available.

(to be assessed as a whole) Section D \u2013 Long Answer Type Question Q24. How does the nature of agricultural practices in a country evolve as the country undergoes economic development over time? Elucidate in the context of India. Answer: In the initial stages of economic development, agriculture may be predominantly subsistence-based, with small-scale farms and traditional farming methods. However, as the economy progresses, there is a shift towards commercial agriculture, mechanization, and the adoption of modern farming techniques. \u2013 The emphasis may also shift from staple food crops to cash crops and high-value agricultural products. Additionally, agricultural practices may become more specialized, relying on advanced technologies, irrigation systems, and improved infrastructure. \u2013 Historically, India relied mostly on traditional subsistence farming, where agriculture primarily catered to the local consumption needs of the population. However, with economic progress, there has been a shift towards commercial agriculture. \u2013 In recent years, India has embraced modern agricultural practices and technologies to improve productivity and meet the growing demands of a developing economy and there has been a focus on diversifying agricultural production by cultivating high-value cash crops such as fruits, vegetables, spices, and floriculture. \u2013 All this has led to a shift from India being a predominantly subsistence farming economy to increasingly adopting more commercial and market-oriented approaches to agriculture. (to be assessed as a whole) Q25. Identify the following statements as True or False and state the reasons behind your response. a) The Integrated Tribal Development Project in the Bharmaur Region is an example of the transition of the geographical theories of environmental determinism to possibilism. b) In the Indira Gandhi Canal (Nahar) Command Area, five out of the seven implementation measures aim to promote ecological sustainability in these areas. This illustrates a shift from neo-determinism to environmental determinism in geographical theories. Answer: a) True \u2013 Environmental determinism is the belief that the physical environment is the primary factor that determines human development. Possible, on the other hand, is the belief that humans have the ability to modify their natural environment to suit their needs but also acknowledges that the environment can impose constraints on human activities. The Integrated Tribal Development Project in the Bharmaur Region is an example of how humans have modified their natural environment to suit their needs. The project has helped to improve the lives of the tribal people in the region by providing them with access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. b) False \u2013 The fact that five out of the seven implementation measures in the Indira Gandhi Canal (Nahar) Command Area aim to promote ecological sustainability suggests that the project is taking a neo-deterministic approach. This is because the project is acknowledging the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that future generations can benefit from it. However, the project is not abandoning the idea of human modification of the natural environment. The project is still designed to improve the lives of the people in the region, and it is still using technology to achieve its goals. Therefore, the project cannot be considered an example of the transition from neo-determinism to environmental determinism. It is more accurately seen as an example of how neo-determinism can be used to achieve sustainable development goals. Q26. In what ways do the disparities in metropolitan cities continue to widen and exacerbate (become worse) over time? Elaborate your answer along these points: \u2013 infrastructure \u2013 social services and amenities \u2013 economic inequality \u2013 education and healthcare \u2013 immigration Answer: Infrastructure: The uneven distribution of infrastructure development, such as transportation networks, housing, and utilities, leads to unequal access to basic services and amenities. Marginalized areas often lack adequate infrastructure, perpetuating disparities. Social services and amenities: Disparities in the availability and quality of social services like recreational spaces, and community services, hinder their overall wellbeing. Economic inequality: Metropolitan cities are often characterized by significant economic inequality. The concentration of wealth and job opportunities in specific sectors and neighborhoods perpetuates disparities in income and socio-economic status. This inequality limits upward mobility and exacerbates socioeconomic divisions. Education and Healthcare: Disparities in access to quality education and healthcare services deepen socio-economic inequalities. Marginalized communities often lack access to well-equipped schools and healthcare facilities, leading to limited opportunities for personal development and hindering overall health outcomes. Immigration: Metropolitans are magnets for immigrants, but this can also lead to disparities. Immigrants may have difficulty finding jobs that match their skills and education, and they may also face discrimination. This can make it difficult for immigrants to integrate into the city and achieve their full potential.

Describe the process of establishment of international trade routes in India with respect to the following timeline: \u2013 the advent of the British \u2013 partition of India \u2013 establishment of new ports Answer: \u2013 Advent of the British: The arrival of the British East India Company in the early 17th century marked the beginning of their influence on international trade routes in India. It led to the variation in the size and quality of ports. They established trading posts along the Indian coastline, exporting Indian goods and importing goods from Europe. \u2013 Partition of India: The partition of India in 1947 resulted in the reconfiguration of trade routes. The partition of the country snatched away two very important ports, i.e., Karachi port went to Pakistan and Chittagong port to the erstwhile east Pakistan and now Bangladesh. To compensate for the losses, many new ports, like the Kandla in the west and the Diamond A harbor near Kolkata on river Hugli in the east developed It led to the division of major ports, such as Karachi and Mumbai, and required the development of new infrastructure to facilitate trade between India and Pakistan. \u2013 Establishment of New Ports: The British developed ports like Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, which became major trade hubs. Post-independence, India focused on developing new ports like Nhava Sheva, Paradip, and Kandla, further enhancing its maritime trade capabilities. These ports played a crucial role in facilitating international trade and boosting India\u2019s economic growth. \u2013 any other relevant point (to be assessed as a whole) OR Q28.
