With increasing healthcare demands, stopping medical device disposal is imperative. One way to achieve this is to leverage circular economy principles in designing medical devices. Circular economy principles aim to retain products and their constituent materials to be reused over time in the economic system. However, to what extent this has been applied in designing medical devices specifically for low-resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa is missing in literature. Based on a systematic review of 29 out of 1,799 screened scientific papers, we identified the use of circular economy principles of durability, maintenance, repair, and upgrade in designing medical devices for this setting. Whether these principles were intentionally applied from a circular economy approach could not be inferred in this study. The motivational basis for using these principles was to ensure medical device longevity to providing healthcare. No attention was given to the circular economy principles of refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling, ensuring that device components and constituent materials are recovered. These study findings serve as a launchpad for exploring how circular principles can be used to support the design of medical devices for low-resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa. Academicians and designers of medical devices can leverage this research to contribute towards developing medical devices that support access to healthcare for people in low-resource settings and preserve earth's finite resources. 1. Introduction To provide healthcare for all, medical devices are highly needed. This need is significantly felt in low-resource settings (LRS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which are areas with limited infrastructure, materials, supplies and human resources (Anyangwe and Mtonga, 2007; Masum et al., 2010; Aranda Jan et al., 2016). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this region suffers from most of the world's diseases and medical devices are highly needed to overcome this burden (World Health Organization, 2017). So far, the need for medical devices in this region has primarily been met through international donations or by importing medical devices from high-income countries (Piaggio et al., 2019; Ssekitoleko et al., 2021). These devices donated or imported with the best intentions towards providing healthcare are usually not optimised to work in the LRS healthcare system (Howitt et al., 2012). Once installed, they face context-specific challenges in LRS, such as a lack of spare parts, repair or maintenance services, accessories, and consumables, which render them obsolete (Richards-Kortum and Oden, 2013; Di Pietro et al., 2020). Estimates suggest that 30\u201340% of medical devices in LRS are non-functional due to these context-specific challenges (Perry and Malkin, 2011; Ssekitoleko et al., 2021), resulting in their premature disposal as waste (Miesen, 2013). Apart from the fact that non-functioning devices do not contribute to improving access to healthcare, their disposal contributes to the 282,447 tonnes of waste generated by the healthcare sector in Africa each year (Udofia et al., 2015; Chisholm et al., 2021). These medical devices, which are prematurely disposed of as waste, still contain valuable parts and materials that could be reused or recycled. Given the increasing healthcare demands and population growth in SSA (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2017; Bigna and Noubiap, 2019), it is imperative to slow down or stop the disposal of medical devices. One of the ways to slow down or stop the disposal of medical devices is to leverage the concept of circular economy (CE). The goal of CE is to preserve the economic and environmental value of products and their constituent materials as long as possible (Bakker and Poppelaars, 2018). CE is vital for moving away from the current global linear economy. In a linear economy, materials are taken from the Earth, made into products, and eventually, at some point, thrown away as waste (Sariatli, 2017). In contrast, CE aims to eliminate \u201cwaste\u201d. This means that products and their constituent materials that enter CE must always remain accountable. To achieve this, rethinking the design of products is critical (Hapuwatte and Jawahir, 2021). Rethinking the design of products from a CE perspective will mean first designing products to remain in their original state or as close as possible to their original state by leveraging on CE principles of physical durability and product maintenance, repair and upgrade (den Hollander, 2018). In the event that products and their constituent material reach their lifespan, they can be recovered by leveraging CE principles of recontextualisation, refurbishment, and remanufacturing. When these products cannot be recovered, they can be disintegrated and returned to their material form through the CE principle of recycling. Note that though product design is vital, it is but one factor in the transition to CE. A successful transition will require other factors such as changes in business models, government policies, rules, and regulations. However, this paper focuses only on the aspect of design. CE in the medical device design domain is not yet a distinct field. Efforts from the scientific community toward integrating CE and medical device design are only starting to emerge (Kane et al., 2018). For example, frameworks advocating for the design of medical devices for LRS to have extended lifespans are now being seen in literature (Piaggio et al., 2021b). Though this framework does not explicitly stem from the CE mindset, it, however, advocates for the extension of product lifespans which is idiosyncratic to CE. Medical devices with extended lifespans can remain functional and available to provide health care for people in need. At the industry level, Koninklijke Philips is demonstrating the use of CE principle in the design of their high-value Diamond Select X-Ray machines. These devices are designed to be reliable, durable, and can be maintained and repaired (Jensen et al., 2019; Oturu et al., 2021). The modular design of these X-ray machines allows for future upgrades, refurbishing, and remanufacturing activities to be performed, so that they can remain in use over time (Jensen et al., 2019; Oturu et al., 2021). Designing the X-ray machines while considering matters of long and extended use, recovery, and recycling, start to drive sustainable practises in the medical device domain. However, it is worth noting that such a device is an exception and is backed by financial support for several research and development iterations, not available to other medical devices. Even though the integration of CE and medical device design is still in the nascent stage, other domains and industries have gone ahead to make use of CE. For example, in Europe, a mobile phone company is leveraging on CE principles of durability, and reuse and recycling to ensure a mobile phones have multiple life cycles and consequently contribute to a positive social and environmental impact (Mestre and Cooper, 2017). Similarly, China 4.0 plan, also known as \u201cMade-in-China 2025\u201d, emphasises the use of CE to minimise resource input, maximise economic output, lessen the influence on the natural environment and improve resource recycling efficiency. Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda's implementation of a ban on plastic bags has attracted widespread praise from global circular economy and environmental leadership (Behuria, 2021). This ban advocated for a transition from single-use plastic disposable packaging to reusable alternatives (Ncube et al., 2021; Oberoi and Garg, 2021). Single-use plastics negatively impact the environment aesthetically and pose serious health challenges (Andrady, 2011; Stoler et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2020) and transitioning into reusable alternatives as in CE was essential. Particularly to LRS in SSA, several studies have identified CE practises. For example, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that in Nigeria and Ghana, repair and refurbishing of electronics for reuse, the harvesting of components for reuse in the manufacturing of new products are common place (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022a). In another example, Suame Magazine Automotive Centre in Ghana leverages CE principles of repair and refurbishment in the automotive industry to keep vehicles in use over time (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022a). These CE principles are used to restore and retain the value of goods and materials for as long as possible to be reused. In other cases, it is a frugal way of approaching daily life to ensure product longevity due to resource scarcity. We expect to find similar principles when looking at medical device design, such as durable and repairable designs that can ensure products are used over time. This is the starting point of this study and aims to answer the following research question: to what extent have CE principles been applied in the design of medical devices specifically for use in LRS in SSA? The answer to this question will contribute to literature on CE in Africa by showing the extent to which CE principles have been incorporated in the domain of medical device design for LRS in SSA. Similarly, this research contributes to the CE discourse in Africa by showing the gaps that need to be addressed when designing future medical devices for LRS in SSA while considering sustainability. 2. Theoretical background 2.1. Circular economy Several schools of thought have defined circular economy (CE) since its inception in the 1970s (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). The definition adopted in this paper stems from the field of industrial ecology and defines CE from a material flow perspective (Ayres, 1994; Stahel, 1994, 2010; Lifset and Graedel, 2002). That is, CE aims to preserve the economic and environmental value of products and their constituent materials as long as possible by lengthening their lifespan or looping them back into the system to be reused (Bakker and Poppelaars, 2018; Kane et al., 2018). Fundamentally, CE seeks to eliminate the notion of \u201cwaste\u201d and ensure products and their materials re-enter the economic system at the end of their use (Kane et al., 2018; Sikdar, 2019). Although there will always be a certain amount of unavoidable \u201cwaste\u201d (Ciacci et al., 2015), a CE intends to work towards a closed loop (Prendeville et al., 2014; Bourguignon, 2016; Hapuwatte and Jawahir, 2021). In this closed loop, resources that have entered the CE must always remain accounted for (den Hollander et al., 2017; Haupt et al., 2017). The notion of CE aims to support the shift from the \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d linear economy (Webster, 2015; Bocken et al., 2016). In a CE, \u201cwaste\u201d should not exist as products and materials are reused as long as possible over time. The mechanism by which products become \u201cwaste\u201d in a linear economy is \u201cobsolescence\u201d\u2014defined as a loss of perceived value of the product, which leads to it being discarded as waste (den Hollander, 2018). According to the core principles of a CE, obsolescence should not lead to waste. Instead, CE activities of \u201crecovery\u201d\u2014defined as any operation with the primary aim of reversing obsolescence, should be performed (den Hollander et al., 2017). With CE activities of recovery, products and materials can be removed from their obsolete state and their perceived value restored and returned to the economic system for reuse. Recovery activities in CE can be ranked according to the \u201cinertia\u201d principle proposed by Walter Stahel: \u201cDo not repair what is not broken, do not remanufacture something that can be repaired, do not recycle a product that can be remanufactured. Replace or treat only the smallest possible part in order to maintain the existing economic value of the technical system\u201d (Stahel, 2010, p. 195). As such, keeping a product in its original state or as close as possible to the original state is at the core of CE. In product design terms, this is considered the maximisation of \u201cproduct integrity\u201d\u2014defined as the extent to which a product remains identical to its original state over time (den Hollander, 2018). Based on the inertia principle and the concept of product integrity, product design in CE should first prevent a product from becoming obsolete. That is, designed for long and extended use. Designing products for prolonged use can be achieved by creating products with high physical and emotional durability (den Hollander, 2018). Designing products for extended use can be achieved by providing opportunities for product maintenance (also known as preventive maintenance), repair (also known as corrective maintenance) and upgrade. Secondly, design in a CE should ensure that products that have reached obsolescence can be recovered with the highest level of integrity and put back in the system for reuse. This means creating products that can be recontextualised (also known as repurposing), refurbished and remanufactured. These first two guiding principles are aimed at preserving product integrity. But, at some point, products will reach their lifetime. Product lifetime is the period that starts when a product is released for use after manufacture and ends at the moment a product becomes obsolete beyond recovery at the product level (Cooper, 1994, 2010; Babbitt et al., 2009; Brouillat, 2015). When products reach their lifetime in a CE, the last resort of recycling is needed. Recycling involves the dismantling and disintegration of a product and its constituent components and the subsequent reprocessing of the product's materials. This process is the least preferred option in CE since it destroys a product's integrity. However, it ensures that product materials are captured and looped back into the economic system for reuse. Figure 1 shows an overview of these CE principles that underpin product design with a focus on tangible durable consumer products proposed by den Hollander (2018). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Guiding principles that underpin product design for a CE (den Hollander, 2018). 2.2. Circular economy design principles in the field of medical device design Medical devices must comply with stringent safety standards before use. Safety standards, for instance, include the safe functioning of medical devices before they are used on patients. In other cases, safety standards require medical device cleaning or reprocessing before use. The cleaning or reprocessing of medical devices involves disinfection and sterilisation processes to render a contaminated medical device hygienically safe before reuse (Gro\u00dfkopf and J\u00e4kel, 2008). The disinfection or sterilisation required to render a product clean is determined by the Spaulding scale (Rutala and Weber, 2008; McDonnell and Burke, 2011). This scale categorises products according to hygiene criticality and describes the requirement for reprocessing medical devices for reuse. That is, \u201cCritical items\u201d (e.g., surgical devices) are those which enter tissue or the vascular system. These devices must be sterilised (all organic material removed) by high pressure or steam. \u201cSemi-critical items\u201d (e.g., respiratory therapy and anaesthetic equipment) come in contact with the mucus membrane and require high-level chemical disinfection before reuse. Lastly, \u201cNon-critical items\u201d (e.g., stethoscopes and tables) are those that do not enter the body and may be lightly disinfected before reuse. These hygienic safety standards are pertinent and must be considered during medical device design. This means that applying circular product design principles in medical device design must also comply with these safety standards and thus ensure patients' health is not endangered. So far, the aforementioned CE principles that underpin product design (as in Figure 1) have focused on consumer products, not specific on medical devices. For example, the CE principle of physical durability only considers how product performance over time degrades slower than comparable consumer products (den Hollander et al., 2017). But in the healthcare domain, medical devices designed for physical durability must withstand degradation after reprocessing over their intended lifespan (Medicare.gov, 2022). In another example, the CE principle of emotional durability concerns consumer-product relationships of attachment and how this attachment influences product replacement decisions (Page, 2014; den Hollander et al., 2017). However, a medical device's function, use or reuse is not determined by consumer-product relationships of attachment. Instead, medical devices are designed to be functional under stringent safety and regulatory standards for improving health outcomes. This CE principle of emotional durability is applicable for consumer products; however, out of scope in the medical device design domain. Table 1 shows definitions of CE design principles from a medical device perspective as derived from the literature. TABLE 1 Table 1. Circular economy design principles from a medical device perspective as inferred in literature. The definitions in Table 1 are derived from literature published by medical device regulatory and authorisation bodies. For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Devices. These authorities are in charge with the task of defining what constitutes a medical device, its safety requirement, and its effective use or reuse (Kramer et al., 2012). As such, these are key sources to use in generating definitions on CE principles pertaining to the domain of medical devices as seen in Table 1. The CE definitions in Table 1 explicitly consider stringent safety standards that are required in the medical domain. These safety standards ensure patients' health is not put at risk in the process of improving health outcomes. The emphasis on the safety concerns in the definitions in Table 1 makes them different from CE definitions in other fields since issues of safety in improving patients' health outcomes are not required. These safety issues are critical in the medical device domain and thus important in this study that seeks to understand the extent to which CE principles have been applied in the design of medical devices for LRS in SSA. 3. Method To understand to what extent circular economy (CE) principles have been applied in the design of medical devices specifically for low-resource settings (LRS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a systematic review was performed. Below, the review steps are outlined and graphically summarised in Figure 2. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Summary of the systematic review process. Acronyms LRS and SSA are low-resource settings and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. Studies were searched in databases such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Using logical operators AND or OR, the key terms medical, device, equipment, use, design, frugal, low cost, development, implementation, low-resource settings, Sub-Saharan Africa, Africa, developing countries, low and middle-income countries, remanufacturing, repair, refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling, circular economy, sustainability were combined and searched. The search resulted in a total of 1,799 scientific papers that mention the design of medical devices. Only studies in English were included. Next, studies were screened by title, abstract and scan reading of the text body by two reviewers according to the following criteria. 1. The study must refer to a medical device as per this research scope. That is, a medical device is \u201cany instrument, apparatus, or appliance, manufactured specifically to be used for diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, and alleviation of disease or treatment of the human body, that are not solely pharmaceutical goods\u201d (Moultrie et al., 2015; Aranda Jan et al., 2016; Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017\/745, 2017). Due to our interest in hardware design for hospitals in LRS, medicines, devices for home care, vaccines, in-vitro, mHealth or eHealth, and other telecommunication systems in healthcare were out of scope in this research. 2. The study must focus on designing new medical devices or adapting existing ones specifically for use in LRS in SSA. Studies that described misuse or unintended use of medical devices in LRS in SSA were excluded. As a result, 246 studies fulfilled the above criteria. Subsequently, studies included in the full-text analysis were selected based on the third and fourth eligibility criteria. 3. The study must refer to and outline the design process of the described medical device. This criterion ensured that the medical device being described could be examined for content relating to the application of circular economy principles. 4. Lastly, the described device must have been through a prototyping stage. Consequently, 29 studies met the third and fourth inclusion criteria and were entered in MAXQDA 2020 for analysis. In MAXQDA, the 29 studies were analysed to identify CE principles (see Table 1) applied in the design of medical devices for LRS in SSA. The analysis was done by descriptive coding. During descriptive coding, a text fragment was highlighted and assigned a code (R\u00e4diker and Kuckartz, 2020; Saldana, 2021) whenever a CE principle was mentioned (see Table 2). These text fragments that explained CE principles were identified in the selected studies by code recording units (see Table 2). A recording unit is a portion of text, sentence, word or word meanings to which an evaluator applies a code (Weber, 1990). The recording units were established in two stages. In stage one, recording units were compiled from preliminary reading through the 29 selected studies and recording keywords, text, and sentences that explained the respective CE principles as in Table 1. For example, design for \u201crobustness\u201d is a word that described the CE principle of \u201cdesign for durability\u201d. This process continued until the repetition of compiled recording units began to emerge. In stage two, the compiled recording units were examined by two experts with expertise in CE and medical device design. These experts examined the compiled recordings units to ensure other possible recording units were not omitted. None of the experts proposed the removal of any recording unit. Similarly, no new recording unit was proposed by the experts. TABLE 2 Table 2. Circular economy principles, codes and their respective recording units used in the coding process. Using the established codes and recording unit, the analysis of the 29 studies by descriptive coding was performed by two persons. This was done to avoid confusion or misalignment of terms and definitions during the coding process. After the first coding round, a second and third iteration was conducted and finalised (see Supplementary material 1 for the coded segments). The outcome of the systematic review produced an overview of the different CE principles applied in the design of medical devices for LRS, as detailed in the results section. 4. Results Seeking to understand the extent to which circular economy (CE) principles have been applied in the design of medical devices specifically for use in low-resource settings (LRS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a systematic review was performed. This review analysed 29 scientific papers. These studies were published between 2006 and 2021 and described the design of 45 medical devices with different hygienic criticality and value (see Table 3). Examples of these 45 devices included a surgical suction pump, wrist flexion contracture, phototherapy unit, blood salvage device, custom-designed implants, a vest for treating jaundice, bubble continuous positive airway pressure\u2014(bCPAP), low field MRI, electrosurgical unit, mechanically powered wound-pump, oxygen delivery system and many others. See Table 3 for the complete list of medical devices. Overall, 55.6% (25) of the devices were electromechanical (i.e., comprised electrical and mechanical parts), and 44.4% (20) were purely mechanical (i.e., had no electronic components). All 45 devices were designed for reuse. None of the devices was designed for single use (i.e., disposable). TABLE 3 Table 3. The CE principles applied in the design of medical devices for LRS in SSA as pinpointed in the literature. The review revealed two key findings. Firstly, medical device design for LRS in SSA significantly took into account CE principles aimed at ensuring medical device longevity. As noticed in Table 3, all 29 studies reviewed in this study made use of design for long use by ensuring product durability. Design for extending device use through maintenance was identified in 18 studies, repair in 12, and upgrade in 10. Whether these principles were intentionally applied from a CE thinking approach could not be inferred in this study. We observe that these principles aimed at product longevity were intended to ensure that medical devices are available to provide healthcare. This is, for example, demonstrated in one of the studies reviewed in this study whereby an electrosurgical unit which is often lacking in LRS, is designed to be durable, repairable, upgradable, and reusable over time even in conditions of electrical failures (Oosting et al., 2020). In the event of electrical failures, this electrosurgical unit can be repaired and upgraded by using local foot-paddle power technology to keep it functioning and thus provide surgical healthcare service for people in LRS in SSA. In another example, we observe the adaptation of existing medical devices for use in LRS. For instance, the 3D printing of components or spare parts in rural Kenya to ensure obsolete medical devices can remain functional towards providing healthcare in LRS. Secondly and most remarkably, the CE principle of recovery through recontextualisation (repurposing) could be inferred in five of the 29 studies used (see Table 3). CE principles of recovery through refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling could not be identified in any of the studies. The reason why these recovery and recycling principles were not considered could not be inferred in this study. 5. Discussion The starting point for our study was the observation that principles of circular economy (CE) can be instrumental in ensuring medical devices designed for low-resource settings (LRS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) do not end up as waste. However, to what extent these principles have been applied in designing medical devices for LRS was missing in literature. We performed a systematic review to fill this gap. As expected, we observed that the design of medical devices for LRS in SSA significantly took into account CE principles aimed at ensuring medical device longevity. The motivational basis for using these principles aimed at medical device longevity is different from the environmental or resource conservation motivations implicitly assumed in the current academic literature on CE. The reason is to ensure that medical devices are available, functional, and used over time to provide access to healthcare, a fundamental human need. Moreover, in so doing so, we see the use of CE design principles such as durability, maintenance, repair, upgrade and recontextualisation that also aim at resource conservation and retaining products to be used over time. Whether these principles were intentionally applied from a CE thinking approach could not be inferred in this study. Other studies have noticed similar patterns in LRS in SSA where the unavailability of resources has led to CE practises aimed at retaining or restoring the value of goods for as long as possible without necessarily linking them to the term \u201cCE\u201d. For example, Korsunova and colleagues noticed resource scarcity in LRS that resulted in \u201cnecessity-driven CE\u201d practises such as \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creuse\u201d to retain the goods in circulation for as long as possible (Korsunova et al., 2022). This necessity-driven CE practise adopts a mindset that looks at the long-term functionality of goods and materials that are often unavailable. As expected, this was also seen in this study whereby in providing medical devices that are often unavailable, CE principles that retain the product to be used over time are taken into account. Designing medical devices for LRS to remain in use over a long time is certainly valuable. This can ensure that healthcare facilities in this region have access to medical devices to provide healthcare. On the other hand, what happens when these medical devices reach their end of life or become obsolete? Besides, a product can be declared obsolete prematurely though still functional. For example, a product can be declared obsolete if outperformed by a newer product (i.e., technological obsolescence) (Clay Whybark, 2007; Kane et al., 2018) or no longer legal to be used (i.e., regulatory obsolescence). In another case, a product might become obsolete when its use is no longer profitable (i.e., economic obsolescence) (Kane et al., 2018). These different forms of obsolescence might push medical devices designed for longevity to be obsolete and end up disposed of as waste. As such, it is important to consider processes that ensure medical devices that become obsolete or reach end of life can be recovered and put back in the economic system for reuse. For example, recovery through refurbishment, remanufacturing, or recycling of medical devices. Products designed to be recovered and recycled can continue circulating in the economic system at the highest value and not end up disposed of as waste (Mangers et al., 2021; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022b). Most remarkably, this study revealed that CE principles ensuring medical devices can be recovered through refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling could not be inferred in any of the studies reviewed. Refurbishment and remanufacturing may have value for medical devices. For example, refurbishment and remanufacturing activities can ensure that medical devices can be recovered and rejuvenated and used again (Steinhilper and Weiland, 2015; Oturu et al., 2022). Similarly, refurbishment and remanufacturing processes can ensure essential product components are brought back to the original condition (Eze et al., 2019, 2020; Boorsma et al., 2021; Oturu et al., 2022) to be reused again. Refurbishment and remanufacturing activities are already happening in LRS in SSA for other electronic devices. For example, the Otigba computer village in Nigeria, a hub for new and used imported computers, and refurbished devices, has over 2,500 daily sales, including assembling, repairing, and refurbishing units for computers (Zeng, 2008). In Accra and Lagos alone, the repair, refurbishment and remanufacture sector generates income for more than 30,000 people (Schluep et al., 2012). Refurbishment and remanufacturing present a real economic opportunity for LRS in SSA though barriers remain. Specific to LRS in SSA, Oturu et al. (2022) described some barriers regarding refurbishment and remanufacturing of medical devices. Among these barriers, are the lack of legislation and infrastructure to support the remanufacturing of medical devices (Oturu et al., 2022). Similarly, the lack of established medical device Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) in SSA that can provide refurbishment or remanufacturing services (Oturu et al., 2022). However, this review could not identify whether these barriers were the reasons for not considering the CE principles of refurbishment or remanufacturing. Also, the type of medical devices which are most commonly refurbished or remanufactured are devices that are of high value (e.g., Magnetic resonance imaging machine) (Dremed, 2015; Kane et al., 2018; Guzzo et al., 2020). In other cases, small and medium-valued equipment is refurbished by replacing specific components (Kruger, 2008). Based on this rationale, we can speculate that some of the devices designed for longevity, as per this study (see Table 3), can also benefit from refurbishment and remanufacturing processes. For example, the high-value devices mentioned in Table 3. However, another factor influencing whether a device can be refurbished or remanufactured includes financial considerations (Guzzo et al., 2020). That is, whether it is financially viable to recover the product or to discard and replace it. Similarly, hygienic criticality is another factor frequently considered when recovering medical devices. High-criticality devices must be hygienically recovered to be refurbished or remanufactured using more aggressive chemical decontamination or sterilisation processes than low- or medium-criticality devices (Kane et al., 2018). This will mean designing devices with materials which can withstand such chemical decontamination or sterilisation processes (Kane et al., 2018). The CE principle of recycling in design is also critical to ensure that medical devices and their constituent material are conserved in the economic system. Though none of the studies reviewed mentioned the use of this principle in designing medical devices for LRS in SSA, it is essential to consider them in the future. This is because recycling which is the last resort for resource conservation can ensure a product's constituent materials stay in the economic system and do not end up as waste (Allwood, 2014; Mangers et al., 2021; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022b). For example, recycling electronics allows for precious and unique metals to be recovered and thus reducing the environmental impact associated with electronic manufacturing from raw materials (Namias, 2013). In essence, all the devices identified in this study (see Table 3) could benefit from recycling processes. Recycling processes and infrastructure are present in LRS in SSA (Korsunova et al., 2022) and can support recycling of medical and other electronic devices. For example, the WEEE centre (Ongondo, 2013; Vanegas et al., 2014; WEEE Centre, n.d.) in Kenya provides electronic waste recycling services in East and Central Africa and the Hinckley recycling centre in Lagos, Nigeria, provides recycling of electronic services in West Africa (Nnorom and Odeyingbo, 2020; Hinckley Associates, 2022). These recycling services include collection, sorting and separating electronic waste to be reused or broken down into raw material form. Similarly, the company Mr. Green Africa provides plastic recycling services in East and Central Africa (Mr. Green Africa, 2022). Its services include collecting, sorting, pelletising, trading and reprocessing recycled plastics into high-quality products (Mr. Green Africa, 2022). With such recycling infrastructures, capturing medical devices' material value is possible in LRS in SSA. The limitation of our study is that it only investigates the extent to which CE principles have been applied in the design of medical devices for LRS from a scientific literature review perspective. CE design principles could also be implemented at the industry level and has yet to make its way into scientific literature. We speculate that investigating the same topic using industry case inquiry methods can reveal new findings on the extent to which CE has been applied in designing medical devices for LRS in SSA. 6. Conclusion This study is an endeavour to understand to what extent Circular Economy (CE) principles have been applied in the design of medical devices, specifically for low-resource settings (LRS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on a systematic review and as expected, this study shows that CE principles of durability, repair, maintenance, and upgrade and medical device longevity can be inferred in the domain of medical device design for LRS in SSA. Whether these principles were intentionally applied from a CE approach could not be inferred in this study. The motivation for using these principles is to ensure medical devices are available to provide access to healthcare in LRS as opposed to the environmental or material flow motivation often found in CE literature. The motivational basis towards providing healthcare for people should remain a core aspect when designing medical devices for LRS in SSA. This research further revealed that other CE principles that ensure medical devices and constituent materials are recovered (i.e., through refurbishment and remanufacturing) and recycled were hardly taken into account. Underlying reasons for this could not be established in this review. This, therefore, presents an opportunity for further research. It is vital to understand why CE principles of refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling are not considered when designing medical devices for LRS. And what needs to be in place if these CE principles were considered in medical device design? The findings in this study are intended to be used as a starting point to explore how CE principles can be used to support the design of medical devices for LRS in SSA. This study now provides insights into the extent to which CE has inadvertently been applied in designing medical devices for LRS in SSA. It further shows the gaps in the lack of attention to recovery and recycling considerations when designing medical devices for LRS in SSA. Designers of medical devices can leverage this research to contribute towards developing medical devices that support access to healthcare for people in LRS and preserve earth's finite resources. 6.1. Implications of this research to academicians and practicians This study shows CE design principles are incorporated in medical device design for LRS, and a firm grasp of the concept can be instrumental and ensure that medical devices continue to be designed for longevity and do not end up disposed of as waste into the environment. Academicians and medical device designers can explore how CE as a concept can be integrated in the design of medical devices that can remain used over time to provide healthcare for people in LRS. For example, developing methods or approaches that can guide medical device design while explicitly considering CE aspects that benefit people in LRS and the environment. Established medical device design frameworks for LRS could also be updated to explicitly take into account these CE aspects. For example, A Framework for Designing Medical Devices Resilient to Low-Resource Settings (Piaggio et al., 2021b) and Towards A Framework for Holistic Contextual Design for Low-Resource Settings (Aranda Jan et al., 2016). Design is only one factor that can ensure CE is implemented in the domain of medical device design. Other factors such as policies and regulations are equally needed to for example incentivise a CE thinking approach in the design and use of medical devices in LRS in SSA. Academicians and policymakers can put forward policies and regulations that support the design of medical devices that can remain used over time in LRS to save lives while preserving the environment. For example, regulations that incentivise the remanufacturing, refurbishment, and recycling of medical devices. So far, these CE principles are yet to be implemented in the design of medical devices for LRS as per this study.

Between 1990 and 2019, we grew our economy by 78% and cut our emissions by 44%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country. However, achieving net zero will require profound changes across society and the economy. Greenhouse gases are emitted from every part of the UK economy and sustained, co-ordinated action across government, business, academia and civil society is required to meet our 2050 target. This transition will involve complex interactions between technology, infrastructure, people, data, institutions, policy and the natural environment. As the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and National Technology Advisor, I will lead the newly established Office for Science and Technology Strategy ( OSTS ) to help the government use science and technology to address the most significant challenges of today and the future, including net zero. Net zero is a whole-system challenge - if tackled in the right way, it could create opportunities for increased prosperity, better social outcomes and a thriving natural world. A systems approach can provide the framework to lead change across both the public and private sectors, and the UK has world-leading capabilities in research and innovation to help inform the approach we might take. This will be supported by the new National Science and Technology Council ( NSTC ), chaired by the Prime Minister, which will provide direction on the use of science and technology to achieve strategic advantage for the UK. Research and innovation will be an essential part of the drive to decarbonise. Success will require us to pursue both mature technology implementation and enhancement, together with more rapid pull through of emergent technologies and discovery and invention of new technologies for the longer-term. We can achieve this through a bold, coherent programme of public sector research and innovation investment alongside appropriate policy support, coordinated with industry, to encourage and de-risk technology development and deployment and mobilise private sector investment. Produced under the guidance of the government\u2019s Net Zero Innovation Board, this Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework represents a first statement of the UK\u2019s net zero research and innovation priority areas over the next 5 to 10 years. It supports delivery of the UK\u2019s Net Zero Strategy and carbon budget commitments, drawing on the existing evidence-base and research and innovation work already being undertaken. It identifies the main sectors and their respective challenges for the UK to reach net zero, the key research and innovation needs that should be addressed and the timescales for doing so. Government funded research and innovation, appropriate policy and regulatory support, private sector innovation, investor funding and academic research will all play a key role in delivering these. This Framework will help to ensure that the UK\u2019s public sector net zero research and innovation spending is aligned to agreed UK priorities. It aims to provide a clear signal to the private sector and our academic and research communities about the UK\u2019s focus areas as we move towards 2050 and to lay the foundations for a collaborative, whole-systems approach to net zero research and innovation activity. Taken together with the Net Zero Strategy, this provides an initial roadmap for maximising the contribution of innovation towards net zero, understanding the social and economic drivers of change and supporting international science and technology collaboration. It will need to be quickly developed into a detailed plan for delivery against which we can track our progress. Sir Patrick Vallance Government Chief Scientific Adviser UK Net Zero Research & Innovation Challenges This Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework outlines the research and innovation required to support delivery of the UK\u2019s Net Zero Strategy. A wide-ranging portfolio will be needed and this Framework details research and innovation challenges across the Carbon Budget and related sectors[footnote 1]: Power Industry and low-carbon hydrogen supply Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage ( CCUS ) and Greenhouse Gas Removal ( GGR ) ) and Greenhouse Gas Removal ( ) Heat and buildings Transport Natural resources, waste and F-gases It also identifies cross-cutting and systems-wide issues and linkages between sectors extending beyond technology to include research and innovation related to systems, processes, business models and the socio-economic and behavioural considerations needed to encourage green choices. Ultimately, both investments to push forward technology development and policy mechanisms to create the conditions to pull innovations to market will be needed to accelerate pathways to net zero.

In the Power sector (Chapter 4.1), renewable energy generation will need to be rapidly deployed with research and innovation driving continual improvements and unlocking new opportunities, such as floating offshore wind, as well as enabling reliable low carbon electricity through nuclear. The wider electricity system must also transform to integrate large-scale and long-term energy storage and maximise the opportunities for matching flexible supply and demand. Innovation is also needed in biomass production, which has potential to aid decarbonisation across several sectors and drive negative emissions through carbon capture and storage. In the Industry and low carbon Hydrogen Supply sectors (Chapter 4.2), continuing innovation to drive resource and energy efficiency alongside proving the feasibility and reducing the cost of low and zero-carbon fuels and feedstocks (such as electricity, hydrogen and biomass) will be critical. Residual emissions will need to be captured at source or offset (see chapter 4.3). In addition, hydrogen is expected to be a key energy vector with uses in industry, for heating, for low-carbon fuels and to support flexibility in the energy system. Research and innovation which supports scaling-up the supply and demand for low carbon hydrogen will be required through the 2020s-30s, including developing and demonstrating cost effective production, distribution and storage of low carbon hydrogen at scale. For Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage ( CCUS ) and Greenhouse Gas Removals ( GGRs ) (Chapter 4.3), even in ambitious decarbonisation scenarios there are likely to be some residual greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions across the UK in 2050. This means research and innovation is needed to support deployment of industrial-scale CCUS technologies over the 2020s and 2030s, to develop other greenhouse gas removal solutions such as Direct Air Capture ( DAC ), for the deployment of CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, and for using captured CO2 , for example, in the production of synthetic fuels. In the Heat and buildings sector (Chapter 4.4), a key challenge is retrofitting the significant proportion of homes and non-residential buildings that require remedial work to improve efficiency and supply low carbon heat. Innovation in technologies, processes and business models is required to support this as well as research to understand how consumer behaviour affects uptake. Research will also support decisions in the 2020s on the most suitable options for heating our homes, including low carbon hydrogen and heat pumps, as well as the longer term role for heat networks. In Transport (Chapter 4.5), electrification is expected to be the principal decarbonisation solution for passenger transport. However, other low carbon fuels, particularly low carbon hydrogen, may have an important role to play, for example in heavy goods vehicles, some buses and railways. Research and innovation is also required on refuelling and recharging infrastructure and how to integrate electric vehicles with the wider electricity system. Innovation is critical in aviation and maritime, which are amongst the most difficult to decarbonise sectors. Research is also needed to understand how we can make lives better by changing the journeys people make, bringing behavioural and technological solutions together at scale with an understanding of how we will travel within our communities. For Natural resources, waste and F-gases (Chapter 4.6), there are multiple demands on land that influence how it is used. Research is needed to understand trade-offs and synergies between food production, forestry and biomass production, habitat and peatland restoration, biodiversity and urban expansion. Research and innovation is needed for methods of sustainably managing forests, peatland and the marine environment to promote carbon sequestration alongside wider environmental benefits; for scaling-up a sustainable bioeconomy, on the resilient supply and demand of agricultural products and promoting sustainable choices; as well as for tackling methane from waste and to develop sustainable alternatives to F-gases. Underpinning all of this is the need for a whole systems approach (Chapter 3). This includes research to understand the interrelated nature of different sectors and between new technologies, consumer behaviour and business models. Cross-cutting themes and system of systems questions include understanding the optimum use of scarce resources; integration of digital solutions; and the need for broad public support of new technologies as well as the development of viable markets, regulatory arrangements and supply chains. This Framework supports an integrated approach to net zero research and innovation planning within government (Chapter 5) and aims to provide businesses and the research community with a tool for their own research and innovation agendas. We intend to publish a follow-up detailed Delivery Plan to show which aspects of this Framework government investment is prioritising based on 3 factors: its impact on decarbonisation, potential economic opportunities for the UK and keeping open credible pathways to net zero. 1. Innovating for net zero Innovation to enable net zero In 2019 the UK became the first major economy to legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. The Net Zero Strategy sets out the UK\u2019s current pathways to net zero and to delivering Carbon Budget 6, which requires greenhouse gas emissions to reduce by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. Achieving these goals will require strong coordination across the UK, the accelerated development and deployment of green technologies and increased energy and resource efficiency, the creation of new industries and business models, supportive policy and regulatory interventions and encouraging a shift to more sustainable green choices. Research and innovation including investment in skills, infrastructure, technologies, knowledge generation and sharing, and stakeholder engagement will play an essential role in making this happen. Innovation and related policy support have helped the UK to decarbonise faster than any other major economy over the past 2 decades. The success of the offshore wind sector in the UK demonstrates what can be achieved through partnership between government and industry and by combining technology innovation with targeted incentives and policies for market deployment. As outlined in the Net Zero Strategy, research and innovation will further enable many of the changes needed to continue cutting emissions whilst maximising jobs, export opportunities and environmental benefits. However, the scale of transformation is profound. Whatever the ultimate route, net zero will involve some combination of the following: Transitioning away from fossil fuels, with continued decarbonisation of our energy system, including electricity supply, heating and transport as well as growth in other low carbon fuels such as hydrogen, alongside large-scale and long-term storage to achieve increased system flexibility; Improving energy and resource efficiency across the economy, including moving to a circular economy approach \u2018reduce, reuse, repair, recycle\u2019, to reduce increasing demand for energy and carbon-intensive resources whilst delivering wider environmental benefits; Greenhouse gas removals at scale, through natural methods (such as tree planting) and through engineered technologies (such as direct air carbon capture and storage). Carbon Capture and Storage technologies are an urgent and essential component for all realistic pathways to net zero; Changes in land use to support carbon sequestration and clean energy, alongside sustainable food production, thriving biodiversity and climate change adaptation; Green choices and practices, including supporting people and businesses to use lower carbon products and services wherever possible. This transition will involve complex interactions between technology, infrastructure, people, data, institutions, policy, and the natural environment. By taking a \u2018systems approach\u2019 government can help to navigate this complexity. Research and innovation will be needed in the technological, socio-economic and environmental spheres recognising that changes to one area can directly or indirectly impact others. Both investments to push forward technology development and supportive policy mechanisms to create the necessary conditions to pull innovation to market will be needed, engaging with both current providers of products and services and new entrants. It will be important to properly engage with end-users to ensure effective product and service design and to remain alert to any unintended consequences from introducing new technologies. Benefits of innovation Research and innovation can significantly reduce the cost of the net zero transition, nurture the development of better products and new business models, and remove barriers to adoption. Innovation has been key to many of the carbon savings seen to date and the cost of renewable energy technologies continues to fall (see examples in Figure 2). However, technologies needed to deliver almost half of the CO2 reductions required to reach net zero by 2050 are still in prototype phases[footnote 2] and will require continued investment in research and innovation to pilot, scale-up and commercialise cost-effective solutions. Estimates suggest that public R&D investment in key technologies could deliver between \u00a354bn and \u00a3115bn of cumulative UK energy systems savings from 2019 to 2050[footnote 3].

Biomass: no change Geothermal: +0.022 Hydro: +0.006 Solar Photovoltaic: -0.324 Concentrating solar power: -0.232 Offshore wind: -0.078 Onshore wind: -0.05 Working back from 2050, major research and innovation challenges must be tackled this decade to keep the UK on track for achieving net zero and to remain globally competitive. Fast tracking carbon reduction requires gaining acceptance for and deploying at scale those technologies that are ready; accelerating the development of those that are not; and researching solutions to problems that do not yet have solutions. Appropriate policy support will help near-to-market innovations drive progress on emissions reductions and attract private sector investment. Investment in discovery research, as well as development and scaling-up of current prototypes, will increase the chances that new technologies not yet ready for commercial deployment, will be available in the future. The UK has an opportunity to be a leader in certain low carbon technologies, services and systems that will be needed globally, with the government\u2019s plan to Build Back Better focussing on the 3 pillars of infrastructure, skills and innovation. Innovation across key technology areas could contribute \u00a360 billion in GVA through domestic and export activity annually in 2050[footnote 4]. Given the geographical distribution of the required activity, this in turn will help to level-up the country and mitigate the risks to jobs and the economy associated with moving away from current high-carbon sectors and help to build back better after the COVID-19 pandemic. The global market for low carbon goods and services could be worth up to \u00a31.8tn by 2030[footnote 5] and, within that, there is an opportunity for UK export sales of \u00a360bn - \u00a3170bn[footnote 6], in areas such as electric vehicle manufacturing and supplying components for the wider electrification of transport, green finance, precision agriculture, renewables such as wind and heat pump technologies, sustainable construction and sustainable infrastructure including waste and water. There are other clear areas where, due to the UK\u2019s current academic and business strengths, we could secure a leadership position in technologies if we act effectively including: advanced battery technologies, advanced photovoltaics, biomass and bioenergy, CCUS , floating offshore wind, fuel cell technologies, low carbon hydrogen\/ammonia, machines and drives, power electronics and advanced nuclear reactor technologies. International trade and investment are key to the promotion, growth and diffusion of UK green innovation at a global scale and for stimulating targeted inward investment to the UK from overseas. They also help to speed-up technological development, scale-up and dispersion, and drive down costs by enabling access to critical resources and increasing the returns to innovation by allowing access to larger markets. Research and innovation should aim to prioritise the scaling of commercial and exportable propositions for the UK alongside delivering carbon emissions reductions. Prioritisation framework Delivering net zero will require a wide-ranging portfolio of research and innovation support across the public sector, private sector and research communities. This Framework identifies the main challenges and key timelines over the next 5 to 10 years across each Carbon Budget and related sector as well as cross-cutting and systems-wide issues and linkages between sectors. It extends beyond technology to include research and innovation related to systems, processes, business models and the socio-economic considerations needed to encourage green choices. It will set the direction for publicly funded research and innovation towards net zero and aims to signal areas where new ideas, products and services have a potential market, to build confidence and catalyse research and investment from business, researchers and entrepreneurs. This research and innovation activity will start to narrow down options and ensure that we can invest at scale in the areas where this is needed for widespread deployment. For government investment, we will prioritise spend based on: Expected contribution to delivering the UK\u2019s carbon budgets and major decarbonisation \u2013 accelerating delivery of greenhouse gas emissions reductions by increasing certainty of technologies \/ solutions, including by taking into account the current state of technologies and the potential for research and innovation to make rapid progress; \u2013 accelerating delivery of greenhouse gas emissions reductions by increasing certainty of technologies \/ solutions, including by taking into account the current state of technologies and the potential for research and innovation to make rapid progress; Building and maximising UK comparative advantage globally \u2013 focussing on areas with the highest potential for UK business and jobs. Developing and commercialising technologies, processes and business models for the energy transition can provide business opportunities and enhance economic competitiveness; and \u2013 focussing on areas with the highest potential for UK business and jobs. Developing and commercialising technologies, processes and business models for the energy transition can provide business opportunities and enhance economic competitiveness; and Retaining optionality of different net zero pathways \u2013 investing in a portfolio of solutions, and tolerating some failure, including novel technologies for areas such as greenhouse gas removals. Both public research and innovation spending to push technology development and market-pull mechanisms such as policy, regulatory and financial frameworks will be needed for success. We intend to subsequently publish a Delivery Plan which will show how these prioritisation principles have been applied and the current government programmes prioritised from this framework. Based on current understanding of technologies and solutions, the likely low regrets measures for investment over the next 5 to 10 years are: Figure 3: Key low regrets areas for UK investment Major decarbonisation opportunities Floating offshore wind Energy storage at scale and system flexibility - enablers of high renewables system Hydrogen - enabler of industrial fuel switching, heat and some negative emissions Carbon capture, utilisation and storage for industry - critical for hard to abate areas Buildings decarbonisation Land transport, including zero emission road vehicles, rail, light rail and active travel Aviation and maritime Agriculture and food Nature-based carbon removals, for example, afforestation, domestic perennial energy crops, short rotation forestry, and biochar. Major business opportunities Transport - aviation, automotive, maritime Energy storage at scale Hydrogen Nuclear - Small Modular Reactors, Advanced Modular Reactors and advanced fuel cycle, particularly in export Offshore wind - with floating offshore wind potential new area for export and domestic deployment Creates optionality in net zero pathways Energy efficiency Carbon capture, utilisation and storage - major enabler for industry, hydrogen and bioenegry with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Innovation within industrial energy sectors - hard to abate and cannot be substituted by other technologies Sustainable land-use Negative emissions technologies including Direct Air Capture The Framework will need to adapt and change over time given the current uncertainty on pathways to net zero and we will need to continue to invest in research for the longer-term solutions. We have not attempted to plan all the research and innovation needs over the next 30 years. Breakthrough technologies could revolutionise our understanding and approaches in some areas, although the time to develop and deploy new technologies across an economy means that the next decade \u2013 and the technologies we have available over that timescale \u2013 must not be wasted. Government, as well as business, will need to be agile and able to pivot plans in the future. 2. Funding for research and innovation Publicly funded R&D The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) \u2018Net Zero by 2050\u2019 report recommended that globally, government research and innovation spending needs to be increased and reprioritised. Technology areas, such as bioenergy, CCUS , electrification of buildings, industry and transport, and low carbon hydrogen, receive markedly less funding globally, in comparison to more established low carbon electricity generation and energy reduction and efficiency technologies. The UK\u2019s Innovation Strategy makes clear that the government continues to be committed to increasing direct public expenditure on research and innovation to a record \u00a322bn per year and a key part of this will be net zero related. UK public funding for clean energy research and innovation has been on an upwards trajectory over the last decade as illustrated in Figure 4. Whilst this puts the UK in the top 10 OECD countries in terms of spend, it equates to just over 0.03% of GDP compared to countries such as France, Canada and Japan which are spending close to 0.05%[footnote 7] or above. Comparisons of spending levels and relative prioritisation of technologies by different countries can be seen in Figure 5. Figure 4: UK government expenditure on energy innovation by technology group (\u00a3m) Source: IEA R, D&D spending database. Description of figure 4 Chart of UK government expenditure on energy innovation between 1985 and 2019 for 10 technology groups. Overall, expenditure decreases from 1985 to 2001, then steadily increases to 2019. Figure 5: Total energy innovation and % spend by technology Sources: IEA R,D&D Budget Database - data reflects 2019 R&D budgets, using 2020 prices; Mission Innovation Country Summaries *China is not an IEA member - data is from Mission Innovation (2019) **2018 IEA data is used Description of figure 5 Bar chart representing the 2019 total energy innovation spend and its split across different technologies for 11 countries. Highest spend is the United Sates, then China; Japan; France; Germany; United Kingdom; Canada; Korea; Italy and Switzerland. A greater proportion of funding is now needed for demonstrating and accelerating the commercialisation of technologies. The IEA estimates that technologies needed to deliver almost half of the CO2 reductions required to reach net zero by 2050 are still in prototype phases[footnote 8]. Given the urgency of delivering key new technologies and solutions to market, funding across early-stage discovery research, development of technologies and solutions and demonstration will need to increase. Within this the proportion focussed on demonstration is expected to significantly increase over the next 5 to 10 years as spend is rebalanced towards scaling-up technologies which will be needed to meet Carbon Budget 6. Private sector R&D Publicly funded R&D will not be sufficient on its own to deliver the step change in innovation needed. Private sector investment in research and innovation is essential and will help UK businesses to compete internationally and accelerate UK growth. The UK has a vibrant ecosystem of innovative start-ups, with more \u2018unicorns\u2019 (start-ups that have grown to be valued $1 billion or more) than any other country in Europe[footnote 9] including a number operating in the energy sector. The Innovation Strategy sets out steps to foster this ecosystem including ensuring our research, development and innovation institutions serve the needs of businesses and places across the UK. This means ensuring firms can access the right private finance at the right stage, creating policy and regulatory frameworks which incentivise innovation, supporting businesses to commercialise new ideas, providing targeted public support where there are gaps in private markets and using government procurement as a lever to pull through innovation from idea to market. Different green technologies and infrastructure will require different types of financial support depending on their maturity (see figures 6 and 7). We must engage all types of capital from early-stage grant and angel investment through to institutional finance like pension fund investors and inward investors from overseas. Public funds will be used strategically to support new technologies, as well as emerging sectors, as they move from the research and innovation stage through to commercialisation and deployment. Early-stage research and innovation is supported by various government schemes, while later-stages can benefit from funds such as the Clean Growth Fund or support from the British Business Bank ( BBB ) in addition to other private investment sources. For larger scale infrastructure finance, the government launched the UK Infrastructure Bank in June 2021. A combination of capital, government guarantees and private investment will enable more than \u00a340bn of investment in areas most prone to market failure and to help deliver on its dual policy focus to tackle climate change and support regional and local economic growth.

Different countries have capabilities in different areas of the energy system and technology development and decisions on which areas of research and innovation to prioritise within the UK should consider whether the UK is best placed to \u2018lead, collaborate or access\u2019. Mission Innovation is the primary international forum to strengthen cooperation on clean energy technology development, aiming to deliver a decade of innovation to make clean energy affordable and accessible for all. Combined, its members represent over 90% of global public sector investment in clean energy research and innovation. Now into its second phase, Mission Innovation 2.0 includes new international Missions, public-private innovation alliances aiming to accelerate tipping points in the cost and scale of clean energy solutions. The UK is co-lead for the Clean Hydrogen and Green Powered Future Missions and is a core member of the Zero Emission Shipping Mission. The UK also intends to associate to the Horizon Europe research and innovation funding programme which, along with participation in International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programmes, offers significant opportunities for knowledge sharing, network building and involvement in the development of future supply chain and market building. The majority of emissions growth globally in the coming decades to 2050 is expected to be in developing and emerging economies as they raise standards of living. This is a key reason why the UK is also a major contributor to International Climate Finance, helping countries adopt low carbon pathways to meeting the energy needs of their populations and industries, as well as managing natural resources and adapting transport systems. Innovation plays a key role and the UK\u2019s \u00a31bn Ayrton Fund commitment aims to help drive forward the clean energy transition in developing countries by developing, testing and demonstrating innovative technologies and the business models to commercialise them. This will focus on the transformation of the whole energy system and work with developing countries on a series of priority challenges including industrial decarbonisation, sustainable cooling, efficient end-use appliances, modern cooking, smart energy, energy storage, next generation solar, and inclusive energy leaving no-one behind. UK action on net zero innovation at home is critical if our 2050 target is to be met, but we also need to support action internationally if we are to pursue efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5\u00b0C. This Framework will support our on-going role in international initiatives and fora based on a clear outline of UK domestic net zero research and innovation interests, while our wider UK offer internationally also responds to the needs and opportunities of international markets and emerging economies. 3. A whole systems approach An economy-wide transformation is required to reach net zero and a whole systems approach considers the interrelated nature of different sectors and between new technologies, consumer behaviour and business models. It considers the order in which different actions are required, and their cumulative impacts, and allows decision makers to assess interactions between different parts of the system and how these can combine to affect an outcome. New technologies, products and processes have the potential to influence other environmental outcomes, both positively and negatively. A systems approach can therefore help to identify potential co-benefits or tensions, manage uncertainty, target points of greatest leverage, mitigate unintended consequences, identify highest value and minimum cost pathways, maximise benefits and ensure an agile and dynamic approach to decision-making over time. This Framework is a step towards implementing a whole systems approach to net zero research and innovation. Each chapter draws out the linkages between decarbonisation challenges and solutions in other sectors of the economy and identifies research and innovation needs that address system level issues. It considers both technological innovation and research into how people will respond to new technologies, services and business models. Research and innovation will also be needed to tackle key cross-cutting themes and system of systems questions. These will be important across many or all sectors and are developed in the table below. These should be achieved whilst leaving the environment in a better state by improving biodiversity, air quality, water quality and availability, natural capital and resilience to climate change. Innovation to mitigate any wider environmental impacts of decarbonisation policies and proposals and harness any co-benefits from the transition will be important for wider government objectives. Improvements to measuring progress across the whole system will need to be developed. Looking beyond 2050, research into climate repair may become increasingly important, but is not considered further in this Framework which is focussed on activities that must happen now. Research and innovation: whole-system challenges and needs Navigating pathways to achieving net zero Whole systems analysis is needed to understand net zero pathways and to address interdependencies and trade-offs across physical, natural, social and digital systems (including via deployment of technology, policies and processes). Cross-cutting research and a wide range of analytical tools, systems models and other systems-based approaches to explore the system dynamics and interactions between sectors in the transition to net zero. Assess the systemic effects of net zero interventions on GHG emissions and other environmental, social and economic outcomes.

Managing socio-economic and behavioural impacts Complex interactions between societal behaviours and new technology \/ policies need an understanding of system dynamics and how norms and green choices can both impact and be impacted by a net zero transition, and how more sustainable choices can be supported and incentivised. Attitudes towards low carbon technologies (such as hydrogen, CCUS , and GGRs ) and measures to build consumer confidence and acceptance. , and ) and measures to build consumer confidence and acceptance. Adoption of, and interaction with, smart technologies, including home energy use, electric vehicle charging and mobility services.

Innovation necessary for vulnerable end-users to participate in and benefit from the net zero transition. Role of advice in empowering end-users and tackling low levels of awareness and acceptance for low carbon interventions, for example energy reduction and efficiency. Developing an enabling environment for net zero through new business models and finance To support innovation across the economy, there is a need to develop new types of business models and financial mechanisms alongside clear standards to unlock the value of innovation, manage risk and enable faster uptake of low carbon solutions. New business models, standards and market arrangements to facilitate uptake of solutions, for example energy as a service and time-of-use tariffs. Green finance options to support new products and services. Economic models for new or significantly scaled-up commodities, for example hydrogen, CCUS and GGRs . Taking a place-based approach A successful net zero transition will be driven by locally and regionally appropriate solutions that vary across the UK. Cities, towns and neighbourhoods will be the locations where integrated cross-sector net zero solutions are delivered. Research and innovation is needed to support these objectives. Living-labs and local testbeds, including public \/ local engagement and participation in decision making into solutions, taking into account skills, employment, impacts, trade-offs and co-benefits to provide equitable and sustainable solutions.

Mobilising digital solutions and data and the shift to Industry 4.0 Digital solutions and technologies, alongside adequate cyber and physical security, can support cross-sector integration, enable systems-level understanding and joined-up action and unlock resource and energy efficiency.

Identify how and where digital technologies may increase energy demand, and measures to reduce energy requirements. Developing an integrated energy system The transition to net zero is driving fundamental changes to energy supply, demand, transmission, distribution, storage and use; trends that will be compounded by interlinkages between energy vectors and across different sectors of the economy. Research and innovation are needed to manage and integrate net zero energy systems.

Five enablers (Data & interoperability; Finance; Policy; Skills; End-users) are seen to influence the 7 research and innovation challenges - Industry; CCUS & GGRs; Natural resources, waste and F-gases; Power; Transport; Heat and buildings; Hydrogen. The following chapters include graphics centred on each sector, which further develop key sector interlinkages. 4. Research and innovation challenges 4.1 Power Context The power sector has led the UK\u2019s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 1990, electricity generation accounted for 25% of UK GHG emissions, by 2019 this share had reduced to 13%[footnote 11]. In 1990, fossil fuels provided nearly 80% of electricity supply. Today, over half the UK\u2019s electricity comes from low carbon sources and the average carbon intensity has fallen by more than 50% from 1998 levels[footnote 12]. This rapid decarbonisation will need to accelerate if the UK is to reach net zero by 2050. The Energy White Paper sets out the government\u2019s policies and commitments for achieving net zero in the energy sector with the ambition now updated to have decarbonised the UK electricity system by 2035. This includes 40GW of offshore wind by 2030 (a quadrupling of current capacity that is estimated to support 60,000 jobs), supporting the development of the next generation of nuclear technology, building world-leading digital infrastructure for the energy system, and a commitment to assess market changes that may be required to facilitate and encourage the development and uptake of innovative tariffs and products.[footnote 13] Substantial electrification of surface transport and heat for buildings means that electricity demand is likely to at least double by 2050[footnote 14] (see Figure 9). In future, it is likely that the majority of UK electricity generation will come from wind and solar, with the remainder from a mix of nuclear, bioenergy with carbon capture & storage ( BECCS ), gas with CCS (see sections 4.3), hydrogen (see sections 4.2) and other renewables such as hydro and tidal power. Figure 9: Electricity mix today and illustrative 2050 electricity mixes Source: Energy Trends, table 5.1 and 6.1; BEIS analysis Description of figure 9 Bar chart representing the UK\u2019s electricity mix in 2019 and a prediction of the mix for Great Britain in 2050. The electricity demand could double as other sectors electrify and be met by a range of generation mixes. As variable and distributed technologies take up an increasing share of supply, the wider electricity system must undergo a parallel transformation with supporting policy changes and infrastructure improvements. Energy sector and other companies will need to invest in transmission and distribution system innovation (including interconnection), long-duration storage, demand reduction and demand-side response - all whilst keeping costs to end-users as low as possible and maximising energy efficiency. Research and innovation in the power sector also presents significant opportunities for international collaboration and UK leadership. The UK is co-leading the Green Powered Future Mission[footnote 15] which aims to demonstrate cost-efficient integration of up to 100% variable renewable energy and is leading efforts to create standardised data systems and digital platforms that enable interoperability and cross-sectoral flexibility to deliver fully integrated power systems across the world. Business opportunities for UK companies exist in a number of areas, including developing business models for flexible markets, billing services and engagement models. The UK also has one of the largest markets for offshore wind and is at the leading edge of global development in areas such as new nuclear, smart technologies and tidal. Opportunities exist to continue to develop expertise and reduce costs across these sectors, to supply both domestic and export markets and integrate UK companies into international supply chains. Figure 10: System interlinkages between Power and other sectors Description of figure 10 Figure representing the system interlinkages between Power and the 6 other sectors: Natural resources, Waste and F-gases - Biomass supply for bioenergy, including BECCS Electrification of agricultural equipment Transport - Power demand for all types of electric vehicles Vehicle-to-X technologies Low-carbon transport of goods Heat and buildings - Electrification of heat (heat pumps and heat networks) Smart home technologies & appliances Demand side response for grid balancing Hydrogen - Hydrogen production via electrolysis Power generation from hydrogen (such as peaking) Hydrogen appliances and vehicles Industry - Electrification of industrial processes Heat networks Manufacture of low- carbon equipment and components CCUS & GGRs - Power generation via BECCS and gas with CCUS Power demand from DACs 4.1.1 System integration and flexibility Research and Innovation: challenges and needs A flexible energy system is essential for integrating high volumes kf low carbon power, heat and transport. The Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan 2021 sets out how government and industry will transition to a smart, flexible, decarbonised energy system[footnote 16]. Technologies such as energy storage, smart charging of electric vehicles, flexible heating systems and interconnection could save up to \u00a310 billion per year by 2050[footnote 17] by reducing the amount of generation and network infrastructure needed to decarbonise. To date, power system flexibility has largely been provided by fossil fuels, as we turn up or turn down coal or gas fired power stations. In the future, we need an energy system that matches new sources of demand to renewable generation by using low carbon flexibility across the system underpinned by smart, secure, data-enabled technologies to ensure reliability and interoperability. Research and innovation can help inform policy and regulation in this context, for example through market arrangements to align price signals with the actual cost of generation at a given point in time, which will help to unlock the potential of flexible technologies. New business models and smart technologies, informed by behavioural research, will give end-users the opportunity to match consumption patterns to times of cheap low carbon electricity and gain greater control over their energy usage. Customer-focussed innovation across the supply chain, including industrial energy users as well as domestic consumers, will be key to this transformation. Demonstrating flexibility at scale in the domestic market and effectively leveraging strengths in information technology, artificial intelligence, financial settlement, aggregation, and advisory services can help to strengthen UK leadership in system integration and flexibility. Accelerating the transition to an interoperable, digitalised, cyber-secure system Develop solutions to increase grid operators\u2019 visibility and awareness of energy assets (such as electric vehicles ( EVs ), EV charge points and heat pumps) - leading to faster, more complete, more accurate registration data available to energy networks. Increase in availability and interoperability of data, including through standards to enable active data flows throughout the system, building on existing infrastructure including smart metering capability, while providing adequate data privacy and security. Improve interoperability and cyber security of smart appliances and flexibility services for end-users, including through standards to enable technology types to interact and operate with service providers.

Investigate the impact of exported energy-based tariff adjustments, incentivising behaviour that facilitates system optimisation. Enabling, developing and demonstrating energy storage particularly at large scales Improve energy storage performance and cost, including: Stationary battery technology where improvements will not be driven by EV uptake, with particular focus on battery management and manufacture. uptake, with particular focus on battery management and manufacture. Immature bulk storage options (such as sodium ion battery technologies). Develop Vehicle-to-X energy technologies. Research, development and demonstration of novel energy storage solutions for a range of durations and at appropriate storage and power capacity. This could include large-scale hydrogen storage, hydrogen fuel cells, gravitational solutions, compressed air storage, flywheels and other mechanical storage systems, supercapacitors, thermal and chemical options (including molten salts, green ammonia, etc.). Develop strategies for integrating various types of storage into the grid, including understanding whether storage is best at the edge or centre of networks. Developing and demonstrating flexible platforms for smarter markets Develop market platforms to efficiently coordinate flexible and decentralised supply and demand, that is enabling multiple buyers (suppliers, networks, system operators) and multiple sellers (end-users, aggregators, local communities) to participate across markets, driving an optimised energy system, innovation, competition and maximising consumer participation. Demonstrate platforms at multiple levels of aggregation including improved interaction between transmission and distribution system operators and linking to other energy vectors as well as secondary trading of flexibility. Prepare networks for the energy system transformation and integration Understand and develop collaborative solutions to manage the changes that arise from a larger capacity, more dynamic system with high penetration of variable renewable energy, including: Solutions that manage network or system peaks and allow better utilisation from a variety of assets such as grid-connected low carbon technologies and in-home flexible use of heating and EV smart charging. smart charging. Lower-cost innovative options for increasing the capacity of the low voltage distribution network to meet increased electricity demand, this includes low voltage smart load management and control systems as well as demand side options. Whole systems integration for future energy provisions around heat, power and transport and improve coordination between networks and other system participants and ancillary services across local, national and international scales. 4.1.2 Renewables Research and Innovation: challenges and needs Renewable generation will need to be rapidly deployed to reach net zero. The offshore wind industry has developed quickly in the last decade. Large-scale deployment, supported through the government\u2019s Contracts for Difference ( CfD ) scheme, has driven innovation across the supply chain. For this trajectory to continue and expand globally, innovation must enable turbines to be deployed in deeper waters and floating offshore wind is likely to be key to unlocking these locations. Innovations in fixed bottom offshore wind will also be important including in wind turbine foundation design, as well those that decrease the costs of foundation manufacture and installations. Other renewables, such as solar photovoltaics ( PV ) at domestic and community scales, are expected to make contributions to our energy mix. UK companies could be at the forefront of technological advancements that will drive up panel efficiencies and integrate with other products and services. This research and innovation will be delivered predominantly through private sector investment, although support for next generation solar photovoltaics at earlier technology readiness levels ( TRLs ) will be needed. Research and innovation can also help unlock new opportunities in other early stage TRL technologies, such as tidal and wave generation. Accelerating the deployment of offshore wind capacity Contribute to global development of next generation turbines by focussing on key areas of potential UK competitive advantage including gearboxes, drive trains, generators, new materials and foundation design. Further innovation to: Improve grid integration to smooth the variability of wind energy and decrease the costs of transmission, including long distance AC transmission, high voltage DC transmission, novel methods of power transmission, and advanced wind modelling. Reduce costs via larger turbines, robotics and artificial intelligence. Improve cable burial and repair, logistics, installation, and smart and remote operations and maintenance. Improve power conversion technologies for offshore grid networks. Unlocking deep water offshore wind sites deeper than 50 meters Research and innovation to improve floating offshore wind technology including: Foundations Dynamic cable design \/ modelling Novel installation and mooring systems and logistics Offshore operations Further improve fixed bottom offshore wind to decrease the costs of foundation manufacture and installation. Mitigating the wider impacts from wind turbine installation and operation (both fixed and floating) Maintain the effective surveillance of airspace by developing technologies that will allow co-existence of radar and offshore wind farms. Develop technological solutions for mitigation and compensation for cumulative environmental effects, including underwater noise effects on marine mammals, the effects of cabling on benthic habitats, the effects of bird collision and displacement and end of life recycling of structures.

Most technology development is centred around 2 broad technology categories - Small Modular Reactors ( SMRs ) and Advanced Modular Reactors ( AMRs ). Innovation is also required in the way that nuclear technologies convert their energy into usable applications of reliable low carbon electricity, low carbon hydrogen, and heat. SMRs are usually based on proven water-cooled reactors similar to current nuclear power station reactors, but on a smaller scale. Components can be manufactured in factories using innovative techniques and then transported to site to be assembled. AMRs are next generation reactors which use novel cooling systems or fuels and may offer new functionalities (such as high temperature heat that could be used to decarbonise industrial processes). These reactors could operate at over 800\u00b0C and unlock efficient production of low carbon hydrogen and synthetic fuels. There is a related policy need to assure investors and developers that nuclear technologies and developments are investable and that credible routes to market will exist.

Improving processes for decommissioning and waste Research and development aligned to possible future fuel cycle scenarios. 4.1.4 Bioenergy and BECCS Research and Innovation: challenges and needs Sustainable biomass has a range of applications as a substitute for fossil-fuel based products and activities. Coupling bioenergy with CCS to deliver negative emissions ( BECCS ) also makes biomass an option for reaching net zero emissions. Biomass already plays a prominent role in the UK energy mix. The conversion of biomass and other organic wastes and residues into fuels met around 10.5% of primary energy demand in 2020[footnote 18]. The versatility of biomass means that it has the potential to provide decarbonisation options in most sectors of the economy including hydrogen production, industry, renewable transport fuels for aviation and surface transport (addressed in respective chapters) and power generation with CCS . The UK will need significant amounts of bioenergy to achieve net zero[footnote 19]. The sustainable sourcing of biomass feedstocks from forestry, agriculture and waste is critical and raises economic, environmental, social, and land-use challenges, all of which require research if the UK is to increase the use of imported or domestic and home-grown biomass (see also section 4.6.3). Whole systems approach to bioenergy Identify the most cost effective and GHG -optimal methods of utilising sustainable biomass to meet net zero, taking into account technical limitations for different biomass feedstocks, where the energy vectors will be needed, where the biomass materials will be sourced, and compare with counterfactual production routes. Creating and securing a sustainable and reliable supply of quality biomass (Note that biomass production is covered in section 4.6.3).

It is, however, also a major source of CO2 and other GHGs , and high emitting sectors include iron and steel, chemicals, petrochemicals (plastics) and cement and lime. In 2019, direct emissions from manufacturing and refineries accounted for around 16% (71 MtCO2e ) of total UK GHG emissions[footnote 22]. Over half of these come from the UK\u2019s 6 major heavy industry \u2018clusters\u2019 \u2013 Grangemouth, Humberside, Merseyside, Southampton, South Wales and Teesside. The bulk of industry emissions result from direct fossil fuel combustion for heat, but process emissions from chemical reactions (such as to produce cement or iron) also contribute. Since 1990, total UK Industry emissions have more than halved mainly due to the changing structure of the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector, improved energy efficiency and a shift to lower carbon fuels. However, despite this progress, the overall pace of reduction is slowing and critical technologies required for further emissions reductions, such as electrification, low carbon hydrogen, bioenergy and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage ( CCUS ), remain globally underfunded in comparison to more established low carbon electricity generation and energy reduction and efficiency technologies[footnote 23]. Heavy industry is one of the hardest-to-abate sectors and many technologies to reduce emissions are still at an early stage of development. By 2050, emissions from industry need to fall by at least 90% with all remaining emissions offset by GHG removals (see section 4.3). The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy[footnote 24] and the Net Zero Strategy set out a framework for how government and industry can work together to achieve decarbonisation targets whilst also capitalising on clean growth opportunities. They highlight the following key milestones and targets: Connecting 2 of the UK\u2019s major industrial clusters to CCS decarbonisation infrastructure by the mid-2020s and 4 by 2030. decarbonisation infrastructure by the mid-2020s and 4 by 2030. Fuel switching to low carbon hydrogen, which has the potential to increase the abatement of industrial emissions from 9 MtCO2e to 11 MtCO2e by 2035. to 11 by 2035. Establishing the world\u2019s first net zero industrial cluster and related systems by 2040. Almost no fossil fuel in use by 2050 unless combined with carbon capture. The next decade will be critical for laying the policy and infrastructure foundations for deep decarbonisation whilst ensuring a range of decarbonisation options are available to industry by 2030. The 2020s are also critical to reach maximum energy and resource efficiency levels before more expensive decarbonisation options are rolled out from the 2030s onwards. At that point, deep decarbonisation must become the norm across UK industry. A range of technologies are required to reduce emissions across different industry sectors and sites. Broadly, these fall into 3 categories: Resource and energy efficiency Switching to low carbon fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen and bioenergy Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage ( CCUS ) for industrial emissions There will be no universal solution and a multi-faceted approach to innovation and wider deployment is required with a need to evaluate and experiment. Environmental and pollution control regulation will also need to adapt for new technologies so that decarbonisation of industry delivers co-benefits for other objectives such as air quality. Alongside technology development, there is a need to strengthen the market for low carbon industrial goods as well as improving transparency on embodied emissions. Mechanisms such as carbon pricing and getting end-users to choose low carbon products and services will be important, including through data transparency, product labelling, public procurement and partnerships with the private sector. The UK is well positioned to expand its low carbon exports related to industrial decarbonisation. This can build on the UK\u2019s existing strong competitive position in fields such as biochemicals (possibly in the future utilising CO2 from CCS ), data analytics and process optimisation, but there are also likely to be new opportunities to develop knowledge and technologies covering the full range of UK industry sectors: metals and minerals, chemicals, food and drink, paper and pulp, ceramics, glass, oil refineries and less energy intensive manufacturing. Significant opportunities are also likely in emerging industries, including low carbon hydrogen and CCUS . Figure 12: System interlinkages between Industry and other sectors Description of figure 12 Figure representing the system interlinkages between Industry and the 6 other sectors: Natural resources, Waste and F-gases - Bioenergy used to fuel industrial processes and BECCS Biomass supply for industries, for example, paper, food, construction Circular economy & material flows Transport - Co-located hydrogen hubs Manufacture of low carbon vehicles and components Transport of goods and services Low carbon materials Heat and buildings - Hydrogen for buildings heat near to industrial clusters Supply of low carbon building materials Hydrogen - Hydrogen as fuel for industrial processes Hydrogen production and storage co-located with industrial clusters Power - Electrification of industrial processes Heat networks Manufacture of low-carbon equipment and components CCUS & GGRs - CCUS applied to industrial processes CO2 transport and storage infrastructure focussed on industrial clusters Research and innovation: challenges and needs Research and innovation is needed this decade to identify and trial solutions which are best suited to different industries and contexts and to reach maximum energy and resource efficiency levels before more expensive decarbonisation options are rolled out from the 2030s onwards. From then, deep decarbonisation must become the norm across UK industry. Improving resource and energy efficiency In addition to policies that encourage accelerated uptake of existing technologies, innovation in resource and energy efficiency is needed in all parts of the manufacturing supply chain. Reduce the impact of extraction and use of raw materials. Development of alternative, renewable feedstocks, along with a step change in the use of recycled material into new products is needed. For example: Research on potential for the chemical sector to use biological feedstocks to replace existing products and produce new (for example, bio-degradable) products and materials. Low carbon material inputs such as lower clinker cements and concretes, alternative binders and cement formulations. More resource efficient manufacturing processes. New technologies and methods for manufacture of existing and new materials are needed, these include: Advanced technologies and new manufacturing processes that can provide a step-change in emissions reductions, such as new steelmaking technologies including electrolysis of iron ore to produce \u2018green steel\u2019. Research and testing related to new heat recovery techniques. Advanced manufacturing technologies, such as near net shaped and additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) to create lighter, cheaper and less resource intensive materials, reduce lead times and extend product life cycles. Digital Twin technology to identify potential issues and inefficiencies and improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of production. Reduce the impact of a product in use. Redesigning a product to have a lower environmental impact including: Light weighting to reduce the weight of material inputs into a product. Using eco-design to design products for disassembly, remanufacture or recycling of end-of-life parts or products so that they can return to like-new or better performance, or new products that can be made with reused \/ recycled and alternative materials. Increasing product lifetime or switching to \/ creating re-useable products where possible. End of life. Minimise the loss of materials at the end of life and prevent the impact of any waste on the environment. For example: Business model innovation (leasing, product service systems or pay as you go) that supports more efficient use of resources. Advanced separation and sorting of waste that enables more and higher quality recycling. Design and produce biodegradable and compostable materials with properties comparable to difficult to recycle materials, such as engineering plastics. Switching to low and zero-carbon fuels (such as electricity, hydrogen and biomass) Innovation is needed in a wide range of lower carbon fuels (including hydrogen, electricity and bioenergy), as well as ancillary technologies to enable fuel switching, such as metering of new fuels and site infrastructure. Support needs to take into account wider environmental goals, such as improving air and water quality, and necessary innovation in abatement technologies for pollutant emissions from new fuels. For hydrogen: Demonstrate low carbon hydrogen as a feedstock for industrial sectors, new products and synfuels. Technologies for equipment categories where there is a potential for significant demand for hydrogen, including industrial boilers and combined heat and power systems (CHPs). Technologies for high temperature direct firing, for example, primary steel production, glass, ceramics and chemicals. Innovation to connect dispersed sites to hydrogen networks in industrial clusters, for example, repurposing parts of existing natural gas grid. Innovation to make existing gas equipment \u2018hydrogen-ready\u2019. Innovation to reduce costs to support low carbon hydrogen being competitively priced. For electrification: Innovation and trials to reduce costs to increase uptake of low temperature heat electrification technologies. Innovation to develop technologies for medium and high temperature (>650\u00b0C) heat applications by 2030. Smart technologies, storage and demand side response to provide flexibility and allow industry to use energy when it is cheapest and cleanest.

Research to understand the best fuel switching options for a range of sectors. Zero emission options for Industrial Non-Road Mobile Machinery. Capturing and storing industrial emissions (Research and innovation needs relating to CCUS generally are covered in section 4.3. This table covers needs relating specifically to industry). The maturity of CCUS technology varies across industrial applications. CCUS applied to sources such as steel and cement is still in the demonstration or prototype stage and requires innovation in the near term.

Innovation in alternative means of transport and possibly capture technology is required, such as modular carbon capture. transport and storage infrastructure. Innovation in alternative means of transport and possibly capture technology is required, such as modular carbon capture.

As part of a deeply decarbonised, highly renewable energy system, low carbon hydrogen could be a versatile replacement for high-carbon fuels used today. The UK is therefore expected to need significant amounts of low carbon hydrogen in the energy system[footnote 25]. Due to its flexibility, hydrogen could be used in buildings for heating and cooking, power and transport sectors and as a fuel or feedstock for industrial processes and products. It is a leading option where electrification is difficult, such as for high temperature heat in industry (like kilns) and for heavy transport including some shipping, aviation and buses as well as HGVs and trains. It could also provide energy system benefits, including for managing peak loads and grid balancing. The Hydrogen Strategy[footnote 26] sets out a roadmap for how we will meet our ambition of working with industry to deliver 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030, along with the development of associated infrastructure, supply chains and hydrogen end-uses across different sectors. Over the 2020s, government will support the creation of hubs where low carbon electricity, CCUS and hydrogen congregate. The Hydrogen Advisory Council has been created to improve coordination with industry to overcome near-term challenges. Beyond our 2030 ambition, hydrogen demand is expected to increase rapidly over the 2030s and 2040s, and analysis suggests we could need 7 \u2013 20 GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity in 2035[footnote 27]. This scale-up underlines the need for innovation support to bring forward a greater range of high efficiency, novel technologies across the hydrogen value chain. Currently, there are 2 main focuses for low carbon hydrogen production: CCS enabled hydrogen: through reformation of natural gas using steam methane reformers or autothermal reformers, coupled with CCS . Due to CO2 capture rates, there will be some residual emissions with these technologies. GGR technologies (including DACs) will be needed to make up this deficit. enabled hydrogen: through reformation of natural gas using steam methane reformers or autothermal reformers, coupled with . Due to capture rates, there will be some residual emissions with these technologies. technologies (including DACs) will be needed to make up this deficit. Electrolytic hydrogen: through electrolysis of water using low carbon electricity. The main electrolyser technologies are alkaline electrolysis, proton and anion exchange membrane electrolysis and solid oxide electrolysis cells. If produced using renewable electricity, this production method is zero carbon. However, there are also other potential hydrogen production routes which are the subject of active research and development. These include using nuclear energy for high temperature processes, biomass gasification with CCUS (\u2018biohydrogen\u2019), photocatalysis and solar thermochemical production. Research and innovation on these production routes can help accelerate the evolution of the hydrogen economy in the UK and support critical decisions on hydrogen\u2019s role. Production and storage of hydrogen may also play an important role in smoothing the intermittency of renewable energy. Hydrogen has the potential to be stored and used when demand requires it to support security of supply and to meet peaking loads. We will need to see significant development and scale-up of hydrogen network and storage infrastructure over the 2020s if low carbon hydrogen is to play its role in supporting UK decarbonisation[footnote 28]. Various options exist for storing hydrogen at scale, including as a compressed gas (such as in underground salt caverns), using another chemical carrier such as ammonia or through the development and use of solid hydrogen storage systems such as solid phase absorbent technology. Hydrogen distribution will also need to be developed. Hydrogen can be transported by road, rail or boat as a compressed gas or liquid, or using a different storage medium, such as ammonia. For larger scale transmission and distribution, pipelines can be used. Newer natural gas pipeline networks could be used to distribute hydrogen through blending (meaning hydrogen injection into gas grids) with the potential to convert them entirely to hydrogen over time. International collaboration on hydrogen innovation is crucial to accelerate cost reductions. As a co-lead of the Mission Innovation ( MI ) Clean Hydrogen Mission[footnote 29], the UK is working with other MI members and the private sector to catalyse cost reductions in low carbon hydrogen across the value chain, with the goal to increase the cost-competitiveness of low carbon hydrogen by reducing end-to-end costs to $2 per kilogram by 2030. In addition, working with partner initiatives and organisations, the Mission members will deliver at least 100 large-scale integrated clean hydrogen valleys worldwide by 2030. These will be demonstration projects to test different production, storage and transport methods and end-use applications, aiming to reach critical levels of investment and experience.

Potential hydrogen town - by end of 2020s 5GW low carbon production capacity - by 2030 1 Net zero carbon industrial cluster - 2040 4.3 Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage ( CCUS ) and Greenhouse Gas Removal ( GGR ) Context CCUS technologies are likely to have applications across many parts of the economy as the UK transitions to net zero. Tata Chemicals CCU plant is set to be the UK\u2019s first operational project. In the near term, the government\u2019s ambition is for CCUS to be deployed in 2 industrial clusters by the mid-2020s and 4 low-carbon hubs, spread across the UK, capturing 10 MtCO2e annually by 2030[footnote 30]. This will demonstrate CCUS technology across multiple industrial sectors, providing crucial \u2018learning-by-doing\u2019 for industry, academia and the wider UK supply chain, and is key to confidently scaling CCUS in the 2030s. In addition, CCUS infrastructure is needed to support GGR solutions. Even in ambitious decarbonisation scenarios there are likely to be some residual GHG emissions in 2050. The Net Zero Strategy estimates that 75-81 MtCO2e of engineered removals will be needed per year by 2050 to compensate for residual emissions in the most difficult to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and parts of agriculture and industry[footnote 31]. CCUS technology will be applied to larger point sources of CO2 emissions, including stack emissions or process emissions. Potential applications include: Industry. CCUS has the potential to be applied to a variety of industry sectors and processes. This includes emissions captured from the combustion of fossil fuels in industrial processes as well as non-combustion emissions such as those from limestone calcination in cement production. has the potential to be applied to a variety of industry sectors and processes. This includes emissions captured from the combustion of fossil fuels in industrial processes as well as non-combustion emissions such as those from limestone calcination in cement production. Bioenergy with CCUS . Combining bioenergy production with CCUS technologies ( BECCS ) offers one of the main routes to removing CO2 from the atmosphere, providing that sustainable biomass feedstocks are used. BECCS could potentially be applied in many sectors including power generation, hydrogen production, renewable fuel production (such as sustainable aviation fuel) and industry. .

This has the potential to enable continued fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation whilst substantially reducing emissions. This offers a potential route to low carbon baseload and \/ or dispatchable generation. Hydrogen production with CCUS . Applying CCUS technology to methane reformation provides a way of producing low carbon hydrogen from natural gas or biomass. This is likely to be a particularly important route providing the bulk supply of low carbon hydrogen necessary to establish the UK hydrogen economy in the 2020s, while electrolytic hydrogen technologies scale-up and costs come down. Innovation is needed to improve current CCUS technology and to deploy next-generation technology. Next-generation CCUS technology aims to have better performance, lower environmental impact and be more widely applicable than current technology. GGR solutions typically fall into 2 broad categories and it is likely a combination of several approaches will be necessary to achieve the level of removals required for net zero. Engineering-based solutions include: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage ( BECCS ) ) Biochar - a charcoal-like product produced by the combustion of biomass in the absence of oxygen (known as pyrolysis). This may be added to soils to increase carbon storage in soil. Direct air carbon capture and storage ( DACCS or DAC ) \u2013 the use of chemical processes to capture CO2 and other GHGs directly from the atmosphere and permanently store it in geological formations or use it to generate carbon containing fuels. or ) \u2013 the use of chemical processes to capture and other directly from the atmosphere and permanently store it in geological formations or use it to generate carbon containing fuels. Enhanced weathering - involves spreading crushed minerals over the land surface to increase chemical reactions which remove CO2 from the air. from the air. Sea water CO2 (and other GHG ) removal solutions. Nature-based solutions (covered in section 4.6) include: Afforestation - increasing forest area to raise CO2 absorption. absorption. Habitat restoration - the rewetting and restoration of peatlands, wetlands and other coastal habitats, which in turn enhances natural carbon absorption from the atmosphere. Monitoring, reporting, and verification ( MRV ) of emissions removals will be key for these technologies to reach commercial scales. For some GGR approaches, the amount of carbon captured and stored can be easily measured and may not require periodic monitoring. In others, establishing this with necessary certainty and verifying that carbon remains secure will be more challenging. Both biological storage (such as soil or trees) and geological storage (such as sub-surface geological formations) are recognised as potential pathways, but they vary significantly in terms of durability of storage and associated risk of reversal. CCUS has potential to be a significant opportunity for the UK, combining expertise on offshore engineering and sub-surface geology and large reservoir space for CO2 storage close to major European generators. The UK also has an excellent academic pedigree in early-stage scientific research and is well placed to develop a global leadership position in GGR technologies. The upcoming Biomass Strategy, due in 2022, will further consider the role of BECCS in delivering negative emissions and we will consult on business models for engineered GGRs in Spring 2022. The UK is well placed to develop these strengths and create significant export and growth opportunities as domestic and international supply chains develop, including options for CO2 use in the manufacture of synthetic fuels and other chemicals and products, with the International Energy Agency suggesting that all synthetic fuels produced post-2040 will be either of biomass or DAC origin[footnote 32]. Figure 16: System interlinkages between CCUS & GGRs and other sectors Description of figure 16 Figure representing the system interlinkages between CCUS & GGRs and the 6 other sectors: Natural resources, Waste and F-gases - Afforestation, soil carbon, peatland restoration Capture of GHGs from landfill and other waste processes Transport - CCUS to balance residual transport emissions, such as long-haul aviation Heat and buildings - Biogenic building materials or other built environment carbon storage opportunities Industry - CCUS applied to industrial processes CO2 transport and storage infrastructure focussed on industrial clusters Power - Power generation via BECCS and gas with CCUS Power demand from DACs Hydrogen - Hydrogen production via methane reforming with CCUS Research and innovation: challenges and needs CCUS , BECCS and DACs technologies will ultimately rely on much of the same supporting infrastructure and will face similar challenges in terms of business models, financing and risk sharing arrangements, and policy and regulatory requirements. The table below covers research and innovation needs common to these technologies. Research and innovation needs related to nature-based removals and sustainable biomass feedstock production, specifically perennial energy crops and short rotation forestry, are covered in section 4.6.3 in the context of the management of natural resources. Capturing CO2 from point sources, efficiently and at low-cost Pre-combustion capture \u2013 gas: advanced reformer technologies to unlock the potential to combine hydrogen production with CCS for power.

Unlocking the potential of CCUS on more dispersed sites that cannot easily connect to CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, innovation in alternative means of transport and storage and possibly capture technology is required, such as ship transport (port-to-offshore) and land-based gas transport (rail) solutions.

Research to deepen understanding of the role of modern methods of construction on net zero. Creating the conditions for future scale-up and deployment \/ commercialisation Scaling-up CCUS technologies and GGR approaches from pilot to commercial first-of-a-kind demonstrations needs to happen over the next 10\u201315 years to allow widespread roll-out from the 2030s onwards.

Demonstrating DACs and other GGR approaches at scale. Policy, regulatory and risk-sharing frameworks and commercially acceptable business models will be as important as technology innovation in enabling the widespread deployment of CCUS and GGR . Further RD&D may be needed to develop and test these frameworks and business models, building on work currently being undertaken by BEIS , including solutions for the integration and interlinking of CCUS technologies to achieve combined capture, utilisation and storage. Research into public attitudes towards CCUS and GGR and how this could be mobilised to support the required deployment of these technologies. Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Monitoring, reporting and verification methodologies for different GGR approaches must be developed by 2030 to ensure commercial-scale roll-out can occur. Before GGRs can be fully deployed on a commercial basis, in either voluntary markets or as part of a compliance-based approach, it will be vital to understand: How much CO2 has been removed from the atmosphere. has been removed from the atmosphere. When that removal has taken place. At what rate that removal will persist, and for how long. In what type of sink it has been stored. The characterisation and durability of that store.

To ensure the credibility of a removal, and support market legitimacy and perception, it is also important to consider: Additionality \u2013 proving the removal activity is additional to what was happening anyway, in the absence of the GGR intervention. intervention.

Most buildings currently rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking, whilst others use electricity, oil, liquified petroleum gas ( LPG ) or solid fuels. Much of the UK\u2019s existing building stock also has poor levels of energy efficiency; for example, approximately two-thirds of UK homes have an EPC rating of D or below[footnote 35], meaning that much of the heat generated is wasted. To reach net zero, virtually all heat in buildings must be decarbonised by 2050. From 2025, the Future Homes Standard will ensure that all new-build homes will have low carbon heating and high levels of efficiency, meaning that no further energy efficiency retrofit work will be necessary to enable them to become zero-carbon over time as the electricity grid continues to decarbonise. For net zero, the construction industry will also need to adopt low carbon materials, low carbon construction techniques, repurpose existing buildings where practical and improve the efficiency of its supply chain operations (including maximising the potential of local or regional manufacturing). Alongside this, a key challenge is to retrofit the significant proportion of homes and non-residential buildings[footnote 36] that require remedial work to achieve high standards of energy efficiency and to use low carbon heating sources. The diverse nature of the UK\u2019s building stock, which includes large commercial properties, public sector buildings (such as schools and hospitals), and a range of domestic properties (from flats to large, detached homes), also means that decarbonisation measures will be informed by local and site-specific requirements, as well as end-user preferences and needs. Developing appealing solutions and an understanding of end-user choices are both critical, as decarbonising buildings may cause disruption for homes and workplaces. For decarbonising heat there are various potential options, including heat pumps, hydrogen, heat networks and biomethane. Some of these solutions may also have a role to play in delivering cooling, particularly as the UK adapts to the impacts of rising global temperatures. The government has committed to making a strategic decision by 2026 on the long-term role of hydrogen for heating, including through community hydrogen heating trials, and to increase the number of heat pumps installed to 600,000 per year by 2028. Innovation will be critical to ensure the right solutions are available and cost-effective. We will also need innovation in business models, finance and across supply chains. Future heating systems are also likely to be increasingly integrated with other forms of energy production, storage and demand, at both building and community scales. End-user preferences may become more specific, for example wanting more control over heating systems, comfort cooling as well as heating, and more engagement with energy consumption and tariffs. These changes point to an increasing need for smart technologies, behavioural insights and new business models and market arrangements. Buildings will be increasingly linked to the power and transport sectors and associated infrastructure, with interlocking innovation needs for integrated, low carbon, flexible technologies installed in homes and businesses across the country. We need to understand and prepare for the energy requirements of a decarbonised building stock, whilst maximising the potential to enable system-wide flexibility. Improved energy efficiency and flexible demand will also help to tackle fuel poverty for domestic end-users, improve wellbeing, and help to reduce energy costs for both domestic and non-domestic end-users. Retrofitting millions of buildings will create hundreds of thousands of UK jobs[footnote 37] and the creation of a domestic market for low carbon materials and products will help drive the transformation of UK industry, in turn supporting exports and growth. Heat network engineering, procurement, construction management and automatic monitoring services are also projected to expand along with potential new markets in hydrogen heating for buildings. Energy efficiency measures could support up to \u00a36 billion gross value added ( GVA ) and 175,000 jobs by 2030[footnote 38]. The development of and integration into domestic and international supply chains by UK companies will be essential to secure maximum economic benefit and market share.

For hydrogen, this involves supporting industry to deliver a hydrogen neighbourhood trial by 2023, a hydrogen village trial by 2025, with an aim for a hydrogen town by 2030. For heat pumps, optimising the installation process, in particular driving down installation costs and product innovation, are the immediate priorities. Other priorities include accelerating delivery of decarbonisation solutions through innovative business models and offers, such as an integrated Whole House Retrofit approach, and research to understand how end-users may want to access solutions that best suit their needs. Developing lower-cost, lower-disruption solutions for hard-to-treat properties, such as solid wall insulation, is another key priority.

Surface transport, aviation and shipping combined accounted for 32% of the UK\u2019s GHG emissions in 2019[footnote 39] and over recent decades efficiency gains have been offset by growth in travel demand. To meet the UK\u2019s net zero target, the Net Zero Strategy estimates that transport emissions could need to drop by 76-86% compared to 2019, down to 23-40 MtCO2e by 2050. This will require substantial change across all transport modes supported by cross-cutting technology development to facilitate a shift in user green choices and attitudes. The Transport Decarbonisation Plan sets out the greenprint for decarbonising the UK\u2019s transport system. It considers how people and goods move and sets out what will be needed to deliver the required emissions reduction on the way to net zero, including through place-based solutions, technology deployments and shifts to lower carbon and active modes of transport like walking and cycling, considering the needs of the whole journey. In addition, the government is consulting on our Jet Zero Strategy, which will set out the approach and principles to deliver the ambition of decarbonising aviation. Close working with other sectors including energy infrastructure, buildings, and land use will be required as well as multiple routes to decarbonisation to mitigate risk in any one technology. The speed of the transition and complex interdependencies involved will require systems-level understanding and solutions. Research and innovation is needed both to demonstrate and accelerate the deployment of technologies that are already close to market, and to develop and test emerging solutions that have potential to be the foundation for future advances. This is crucial in the harder to decarbonise maritime and aviation sectors, but also essential to ensure the UK retains its technological leadership in the automotive sector, one of the places where we are already seeing an acceleration in activity. It also means social research and behavioural science to accelerate the adoption of active travel and public transport and to enable the shift to zero emission vehicles as well as a better understanding of how we can provide people with better choices around travel. Co-benefits of improved air quality and reducing adverse health impacts are likely to provide an additional incentive for change. Necessary new skills will need to be developed and widely available in time across manufacturing, supply chain and service industries. Innovation in the electricity market, infrastructure, and flexible services will be required to support decarbonisation in transport. Whilst the electrification of most surface transport will create new demand for electricity, it also provides opportunities for enhanced system flexibility through vehicle to grid technologies (see chapter 4.1.1). Transport-related research and innovation should include the following. Address the transport modes, nodes and use cases where there are currently no clear or agreed solutions (the harder to decarbonise areas) alongside efforts to increase efficient and sustainable supply of resources for technologies that are close to market (such as newer battery technologies). Understand how we can make lives better by changing the journeys people need to make. This includes technologies that alter the need to travel, change travel modes or shift travel times, social trends which impact on commuting and work and changes to how we transport goods. Understand when, where and how much decarbonised energy is required for each transport mode, and for the system as a whole, now and into the future. Develop transport-specific energy supply technologies and other supporting infrastructure, including manufacture, as part of a place-based, decentralised wider energy system. Support new product development leading to manufacturing scale-up and investment, anchoring the value chain in the UK to maximise UK content and economic benefit alongside meeting net zero targets and exploring co-benefits. Deliver systems-level decarbonisation and modal shift, by bringing behavioural and technological solutions together at scale to meet user needs for particular geographical areas, sectors, and services. Innovation needs include options for road freight, maritime and aviation to identify and develop best fit technology pathways for the UK by the mid-2020s; preparation of demonstration programmes and trial infrastructure which will be ready to test and understand the implementation of these new solutions in the mid-2020s to enable roll-out through the 2030s \u2013 especially where vehicles have long operational lives like trains and ships; and identifying complementary options for decreasing road emissions to meet Carbon Budget 6. This includes behaviour change, modal shift and data-driven approaches. The medium-term (2025 to 2030) focus will be completing demonstration programmes in trucks, maritime and aviation; continuing to support the penetration of electrification throughout the light road vehicle fleet; supporting decisions on UK-wide infrastructure needs (charging infrastructure, hydrogen, ports and airports) and how they are best integrated into the wider energy system; as well as data and asset sharing in the freight and logistics system to enable better carbon efficiency in the short-term and efficient deployment of zero-emissions vehicles and other assets in the medium \/ longer term. The challenges of transportation are heightened by the international context. Most modes have interfaces with other countries or at the very least similarities which have implications for standardisation of technologies, the harmonisation of regulations, and the sharing of learning and effort. For example, as a core member of the Zero-Emission Shipping Mission[footnote 40], the UK is working across the entire maritime value-chain\u2014 ships, fuel production, fuel infrastructure\u2014 through a focus on \u2018green shipping corridors\u2019. Investments in research and innovation will also provide market opportunities for UK companies, especially in the hardest-to-decarbonise transport sectors such as shipping, aviation and heavy goods vehicles, where all countries will be facing the same challenges, and in relation to the development and commercialisation of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels. In addition, by pursuing an integrated approach that combines active travel and micro-mobility with behavioural science and new low emissions infrastructure, the UK can showcase systems-levels solutions and export related technologies and services to other countries.

Key areas for attention include developing a better understanding of system level interdependencies and ensuring that people and place are both central to a net zero transition. Behaviour change and choice need to interact with technology innovations if we are to successfully deliver the required decarbonisation. Research into behaviour and the application of behavioural theory can build an understanding of current and future users\u2019 needs and likely green choices and how best to influence them, informing structural changes in policies, regulation, and infrastructure. Embedding these insights into transport decarbonisation decisions will allow for more effective and targeted investment in transport research and innovation. Enabling an integrated, multi-modal transport system Understand how to integrate transport into local and national decarbonised energy system planning, including both the electricity system and a future hydrogen economy without impacting the government\u2019s statutory targets to improve the environment, such as for air quality. System analysis to identify interactions with wider systems and infrastructure, including optimal locational configurations for refuelling and charging infrastructure for different modes of transport.

Electrification is expected to be the principal decarbonisation solution, but other low carbon fuels, particularly hydrogen, may have an important role to play particularly for HGVs , other larger vehicles, and for trains on hard-to-electrify lines. Research and innovation challenges focus on technologies for different transport modes, how to design and build new refuelling and recharging infrastructure and how to integrate electric vehicles with the wider electricity system.

Maritime emissions are growing as a proportion of all transport emissions, with domestic shipping producing more GHGs in 2019 than buses and rail combined[footnote 43]. If UK international shipping emissions are also included, the maritime sector produces almost 3 times the GHG emitted in 2019 by buses and rail combined. Both aviation and maritime are amongst the most difficult-to-decarbonise sectors of the economy with most low carbon and zero-carbon solutions at very early stages of development. As a result, research and innovation is particularly crucial in these sectors and a variety of potential solutions need to be developed and tested over the coming decade, to enable the best options to be scaled up. This includes Sustainable Aviation Fuels obtained from low carbon feedstocks which could be combined with existing conventional jet fuel to reduce emissions. The transnational nature of aviation and maritime underscores the importance of global collaboration to develop fully interoperable solutions for the refuel and recharge of aircraft and vessels.

These sectors will need to contribute to net zero in 4 ways. By reducing direct emissions. Currently around 10% of the UK\u2019s total GHG emissions come from agriculture and around 4% from the waste sector [footnote 44] . These are mostly non- CO2 emissions such as methane from livestock and decomposing waste, and nitrous oxide from the application of fertiliser and organic materials to land. emissions come from agriculture and around 4% from the waste sector . These are mostly non- emissions such as methane from livestock and decomposing waste, and nitrous oxide from the application of fertiliser and organic materials to land. By sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping to offset residual emissions from other hard-to-abate sectors. Afforestation and changes in land management offer routes to achieve this objective, but air quality currently has a significant impact on tree health, which may impact on their ability to sequester carbon at the rate expected. By providing sustainable biomass for energy generation directly and in the production of other fuels (such as sustainable aviation fuels) and the wider bioeconomy (such as wood in construction and for bio-based plastics). This can reduce emissions from materials with high GHG emissions, such as cement, and provide additional storage of carbon, although the risks of wider negative impacts from unsustainable biomass use must be carefully managed. emissions, such as cement, and provide additional storage of carbon, although the risks of wider negative impacts from unsustainable biomass use must be carefully managed. By reducing the use of F-gases in equipment such as refrigeration and air-conditioning (driven by a switch to alternative gases and technologies). Delivery of these aims must be achieved at the same time as improving biodiversity, air quality, water quality, natural capital, ecosystem services and resilience to climate change. The 25 Year Environment Plan sets out the UK\u2019s goals for improving the environment within a generation. It aims to deliver cleaner air and water, protect species and habitats, tackle waste and soil degradation and help to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The plan, which incorporates the government\u2019s statutory targets, aims to deliver once-in-a-lifetime changes to reform agriculture and manage land more sustainably. Ongoing research and monitoring will be needed to provide the evidence base to guide policy and related decision making over time. This will require an integrated, systems-based approach that takes account of emissions reduction alongside the need to meet these other statutory environmental targets and social and economic goals. There will be co-benefits and trade-offs between different objectives, and these need to be managed responsibly with a broad understanding of wider impacts across different sectors and places. Social and behavioural considerations and a focus on environmental science will be as important as technology in driving innovation and the changes needed for net zero, such as changes in consumer demand for food, public acceptability of new products, and the willingness of farmers and land managers to adopt new approaches. As a result, research and innovation must focus on people as much as technology and environmental science. Scientific breakthroughs in nutrition, genetics, informatics and big data, remote sensing, engineering, robotics, meteorology, and monitoring technologies are playing a key part in developing technologies to transform traditional practices. Business opportunities exist in the UK agri-tech sector, which serves a growing international market; in the biosciences and biotechnologies sector; in carbon professional services, such as selling expertise in low carbon farming practices; and in monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions. Carbon sequestration projects may also provide future opportunities when further developed. Figure 22: System interlinkages between Natural Resources, Waste and F-gases and other sectors Description of figure 22 Figure representing the system interlinkages between Natural resources, Waste and F-gases and the 6 other sectors: Transport - Production and use of sustainable biofuels Low-carbon transport of agricultural goods and forestry products Industry - Bioenergy used to fuel industrial processes and BECCS Biomass supply for industries, for example, paper, food, construction Circular economy & material flows Heat and buildings - Bioenergy for hard- to-decarbonise buildings Biogas grid injection Biogenic building materials Hydrogen - H2-BECCS (hydrogen production from biomass using CCUS) Water demand for hydrogen production Power - Biomass supply for bioenergy, including BECCS Electrification of agricultural equipment CCUS & GGRs - Afforestation, soil carbon, peatland restoration Capture of GHGs from landfill and other waste processes 4.6.1 An integrated and dynamic approach to land-use Research and innovation: challenges and needs There are multiple demands on land that influence how it is used and the urgency of net zero means that actions may need to be taken before all wider impacts are adequately understood. Compounding this challenge is the complexity of interactions between land management decisions, impacts on society and the natural environment and overall GHG emissions \u2013 including those outside the UK. Land-use planning is therefore a key consideration for research and innovation. A flexible and dynamic approach, that recognises the tensions and trade-offs in decision making will be essential, underpinned by the best possible understanding of the multi-objective systemic nature of land use and management. Land use allocation & planning considerations Develop the tools and capabilities to inform land-use decisions and policy interventions at national and local scales, taking into account the interplay between land-use, end user preferences, land manager acceptability, policy and regulatory frameworks, incentives and technologies: Research on green financing framework and practical applications of blended finance mechanisms. Research on the economic values of protected landscapes. Research on Monitoring and evaluation of landscapes policies. Understanding system level greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts Systems research to assess solutions within land, social, economic and environmental constraints, and considering a broad range of impacts including on natural capital and climate resilience: Research into agroecological and integrated farm management practices. Understanding the impact historical land use or pollution deposition may have on the ability to deliver carbon sequestration goals. Develop modelling and datasets for greenhouse gas impacts of agricultural processes, forestry, peat and soils, to understand impact of changes at system level in conjunction with other environmental pressures, such as air quality.

Research to measure profitability of sustainable and responsible farming systems on peat and soils and how food production will be impacted. Research to review how existing land use models are informing economic growth decisions at both national and local level: Understand how skills programmes and education strategy can support environmental goals and green growth. Research on environmental taxation. Research on environmental impacts of new trade agreements. Research on corporate natural capital accounting. Research on barriers to accessing nature for certain demographics. 4.6.2 Forests, peatland and the marine environment Research and innovation: challenges and needs The UK\u2019s natural assets, such as its treescape, forests, soils, peatlands and marine environments are important habitats for a range of species and provide multiple benefits to society, including carbon storage and sequestration, low carbon energy generation and feedstock production, biodiversity and improved natural capital assets. Net zero will require changes to the management of these environments and research is required to better understand these changes and their impacts, and new approaches and solutions will need to be developed and demonstrated. Trees act as a natural carbon sink and are essential to meet long term targets. The government is committed to increasing tree-planting in the UK to 30,000 hectares (ha) per year by 2025 and alongside this there is a need to improve the management of existing woodlands. This must be underpinned by research into appropriate species selection and responsible land management practices. Peat is the UK\u2019s largest terrestrial carbon store. Farmed lowland peat is currently responsible for 86% of England\u2019s peatlands carbon emissions, but is also some of the most productive agricultural land. Better management of lowland and upland peatlands will see a range of co-benefits alongside climate change mitigation. However, significant areas of peatland exceed safe thresholds for nitrogen deposition and ammonia exposure which damages the mosses responsible for peat production. The government is committed to restoring 35,000 ha of peat in England by 2025. Healthy soils underpin a range of environmental, economic and societal benefits including carbon storage and biodiversity. The 25 Year Environment Plan sets the goal of sustainably managing all of England\u2019s soils by 2030. Developing a healthy soils indicator, soil structure and soil health measuring and monitoring schemes will enable the government to deliver on this target; research into methodologies and baseline data sets will support the development of suitable metrics and indicators. Certain marine and coastal habitats, including saltmarsh, seagrass and marine sediments, are important long-term carbon stores. These habitats can be lost or damaged by human activities and their area is being squeezed by sea level rise, which can contribute to carbon emissions, whilst habitat creation and restoration could contribute to carbon removals whilst also providing a range of co-benefits for biodiversity and climate adaptation. Currently 38% of UK waters are in Marine Protected Areas, covering the majority of saltmarsh and seagrass habitats, with the government now taking steps to ensure these are effectively protected. The marine environment also hosts infrastructure such as offshore wind, and this development must be pursued in ways that protect or enhance ecosystems. Sustainably expanding and managing forests and the wider treescape Develop and trial improved ground based and remote sensing technologies and modelling for carbon storage calculations, including forest soils and trees outside woodlands. Expand long term plot monitoring to resolve uncertainties. Understand the variability and dependencies between different woodland types and silvicultural dependencies (rewilding, natural colonisation, etc.) including to changing climatic and environmental conditions. Understand silvicultural and arable agroforestry impacts on biomass and soil carbon, soil health and wider greenhouse gas balances. Manage and trial strategies to minimise damage to forestry from pests and pathogens. Field trials of short rotation forestry, including using exotic species for biomass. Develop and trial innovative finance models for land managers to transition to forestry. Develop and trial innovative supply chains for planting materials well adapted to the UK. Understand social and behavioural drivers and barriers, for example, land ownership, acceptability, skills, finance, incentives, co-benefits. Collaborative R&D with the commercial forestry and building sectors to increase supply and demand of timber in built infrastructure. Establish robust estimates of the abatement delivered by harvested wood products in use through carbon storage and product substitution. Developing increased resilience of forest ecosystems to climate change impacts Improved understanding of the resilience of woodlands and trees to climate change, including impacts of pests, diseases and other environmental pressures such as air quality. Genomic sequencing of tree populations and mapping of characteristics to improve enhancements beneficial to future circumstances. Research into the soil bacteria characteristics of different forest types, to understand how bacterial communities enhance (or disadvantage) resilience in different ways. Research into fungi characteristics of different forest types, to understand how fungi enhance (or disadvantage) resilience in different ways. Restoring sustainably and managing peatlands Research into, and the development of, sustainable lowland peat management options that allow for productive and profitable agriculture to take place while water levels are raised, to sustain healthy and wildlife rich peatlands which provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and flood mitigation and which do not lead to other negative impacts. Understanding the tensions and trade-offs between food production, greenhouse gas emission abatement and peat loss. Improved evidence on greenhouse gas balances of peatland restoration establishing the rate of deployment, scientific uncertainty, associated costs and trade-offs. Better understanding of optimal landscape scale water management for wetter peat (to reduce emissions) and mitigating flood risk.

Solutions are needed to reduce these emissions whilst also addressing other land-based challenges such as food security. Research and innovation needs to address both the supply and demand of agricultural products, and to develop solutions that support sustainable choices and acceptance of end-users and farmers. This may include non-traditional forms of production including vertical agriculture and lab-based production of alternative proteins. The current biomass resource supply is diverse. A significant portion of biomass for use in energy generation and the wider bioeconomy is sourced from wastes and residues from the agriculture, forestry and waste sectors[footnote 45]. While the majority of biomass used in the production of renewable electricity and heat is from domestic sources, imported wood pellets are also important feedstocks. Most feedstocks used for renewable transport fuels derive from international sources. Increasing the UK\u2019s domestic supply of sustainable biomass feedstocks (principally perennial energy crops and short rotation forestry) could support decarbonisation efforts through nature-based carbon sequestration. A number of research and innovation challenges need to be overcome to achieve a scale-up in domestic biomass. This also needs to be carefully managed so that using organic materials for energy does not direct resources away from agriculture and forestry or lead to unintended negative environmental impacts, including the ability to meet statutory environmental targets. Sustainable production of food, perennial energy crops and short rotation forestry Research into novel technological approaches to decrease agricultural emissions and enhance sustainable production to meet food demand: Transformational approaches to food production including (but not limited to) vertical agriculture, urban farming, synthetic alternatives to high carbon food products, agroecology, regenerative agriculture, no-till systems, etc. Precision farming solutions to monitor all aspects of animal and crop production including health, nutrition and performance to optimise management and reduce inputs.

Develop understanding of where bio-derived chemicals can displace fossil fuels in the medium-term; supporting these supply chains. 4.6.4 Waste and F-gases Research and innovation: challenges and needs Emissions from waste have reduced substantially since 1990 but further action is required to tackle methane from the decomposition of biodegradable waste in landfill sites, emissions produced from the treatment of wastewater, and emissions from the biological treatment, composting and incineration of waste. Innovation is required to support the reduction of waste to help meet government targets, turn unavoidable waste into useful products and to improve and deploy anaerobic digestion technologies. F-gases account for around 3% of total UK GHG emissions[footnote 46] and hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) \u2013 used for applications such as refrigeration and air-conditioning \u2013 are by far the biggest source. The UK has a target to cut HFCs by 79% by 2030 and has an international obligation for an 85% cut in HFC consumption by 2036, which requires the adoption of alternative gases and technologies that use them. The UN Montreal Protocol Parties have committed to explore options to expand the global coverage of atmospheric monitoring of ozone-depleting substances and HFCs , to tackle illegal emissions of CFC-11 and safeguard the successes of the Montreal Protocol in ozone layer protection and climate change mitigation. The UK has world leading expertise on atmospheric monitoring which provides an opportunity to contribute to this work.

An integrated Net Zero Research & Innovation Framework What research and innovation is needed? This Framework highlights that urgent research and innovation is needed to accelerate the commercialisation of solutions at scale, which can provide the carbon emission reductions needed in the UK for Carbon Budget 6 and for net zero. Larger-scale demonstrations and trials will need an increased share of research and innovation spending through the 2020s and 2030s, recognising that almost half of the CO2 reductions required to reach net zero by 2050 will need to come from technologies that are still in the prototype phase. Figure 24 illustrates key research and innovation challenges for the UK\u2019s transition to net zero by 2050. Renewable energy generation will need to be rapidly deployed with research and innovation driving continual improvements and unlocking new opportunities, such as floating offshore wind, as well as enabling reliable low carbon electricity through nuclear. Innovation will be needed to transform the wider electricity system and networks and to realise the potential for biomass across a number of hard to decarbonise sectors and through BECCS to drive negative emissions. Continuing innovation to improve resource and energy efficiency alongside proving the feasibility of low and zero-carbon fuels and feedstocks (such as electricity, hydrogen and biomass) will be needed to decarbonise industry with residual emissions captured at source or offset by greenhouse gas removals. Hydrogen is expected to become a key energy vector with research and innovation needed to support the scale-up of low carbon hydrogen supply, demand, transportation and storage. Even in ambitious decarbonisation scenarios, there are likely to be residual UK GHG emissions in 2050. Research and innovation is needed both to support an urgent deployment of industrial-scale CCUS technologies and to develop other GGR solutions to address those residual emissions. In our homes and buildings, innovation is needed in technologies, processes, business models and consumer behaviour to support large-scale retrofit of low carbon heating and energy efficiency measures, and to support key decisions amongst candidate options for heating our homes. On roads, electrification is expected to be the principal option but other low carbon fuels, particularly hydrogen, may have an important role to play, for example in HGVs , with research and innovation on refuelling and recharging infrastructure also of importance. Zero carbon solutions for aviation and maritime are still at much earlier stages of development and will require significant investment out to 2050. Research is also needed to understand how peoples\u2019 journeys are changing and on solutions tailored for different local contexts. How we best use the UK\u2019s natural resources and land remains a key research question. The answer will require deep understanding of tensions and trade-offs between food production, forestry and biomass production, habitat and peatland restoration, urban expansion, and promoting greater carbon sequestration alongside wider environmental benefits. Scaling-up a sustainable bioeconomy, decarbonising the agricultural sector, tackling methane from waste and developing sustainable alternatives to F-gases will also require research. Underpinning all of this is the need for a whole systems approach. Research will help to build our understanding of the interrelated nature of different sectors and between new technologies, consumer behaviour and business models. This lens helps to highlight key cross-cutting themes such as the integration of digital solutions across all parts of our economy and society to drive greater resource and energy efficiency. Above all the need for broad public support and development of viable markets and supply chains needs to go hand in hand with the development of new technologies if research and innovation is to help deliver our net zero ambition. Choices will need to be made and the solutions will need to be deployed at scale and at a sustainable cost.

The Net Zero Strategy sets out several viable pathways to net zero and we should avoid locking ourselves into any one technology pathway prematurely. This means investing widely and accepting some investments will not deliver the expected benefits or offer a viable commercial proposition. Ultimately it is the commercialisation of innovative low-carbon products and services, not the innovation itself, that leads to benefits by way of lower energy costs, reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, energy security and business growth. However, within this we will need to prioritise. Working back from 2050, Figure 24 shows the sequence for technologies (and research for policy decisions) as they move through early-stage research, feasibility and technical development and onto demonstration at scale, to reach commercial deployment in time to deliver our Net Zero commitment. For government investment, we will prioritise spend based on: Expected contribution to delivering the UK\u2019s carbon budgets and major decarbonisation \u2013 accelerating delivery of carbon emissions reductions by increasing certainty of technologies \/ solutions, including by taking into account the current state of technologies and the potential for research and innovation to make rapid progress. Building and using UK comparative advantage globally \u2013 focussing on areas with the highest potential for UK business and jobs. Developing and commercialising technologies, processes and business models for the net zero transition can provide business opportunities and enhance economic competitiveness. Retaining optionality of different net zero pathways \u2013 investing in a portfolio of solutions (tolerating some failure) and ensuring technologies which we cannot reach net zero without are invested in, including greenhouse gas removals. Government intervention will be needed where market failures prevent private sector investment, to de-risk and accelerate private sector action or where there is potential to develop areas of UK strategic advantage. This public research and innovation spending can be used to push technology development, which will complement market-pull mechanisms such as policy, regulatory and financial frameworks (for example, Contracts for Difference; Internal Combustion Engine phase-out). Both approaches will be needed for success. Based on our current understanding we expect to prioritise: Major decarbonisation opportunities Floating offshore wind Energy storage at scale and system flexibility - enablers of high renewables system Hydrogen - enabler of industrial fuel switching, heat and some negative emissions Carbon capture, utilisation and storage for industry - critical for hard to abate areas Buildings decarbonisation Land transport, including zero emission road vehicles, rail, light rail and active travel Aviation and maritime Agriculture and food Nature-based carbon removals, for example afforestation, domestic perennial energy crops, short rotation forestry, and biochar. Major business opportunities Transport - aviation, automotive, maritime Energy storage at scale Hydrogen Nuclear - Small Modular Reactors, Advanced Modular Reactors and advanced fuel cycle, particularly in export Offshore wind - with floating offshore wind potential new area for export and domestic deployment Creates optionality in net zero pathways Energy efficiency Carbon capture, utilisation and storage - major enabler for industry, hydrogen and bioenegry with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Innovation within industrial energy sectors - hard to abate and cannot be substituted by other technologies Sustainable land-use Negative emissions technologies including Direct Air Capture How should this Framework be used? This Framework lays the foundation for net zero research and innovation planning within government and aims to provide innovative businesses and academic and research communities with a tool to guide their own research and innovation agendas. We do not expect government programmes to cover all the needs identified by this Framework and we will prioritise those where government intervention is most needed based on the criteria outlined above. As research delivers more answers it should be possible to focus on scale-up and deployment spend in the key areas. For publicly funded research and innovation, the government intends to publish a Delivery Plan to show what current and planned programmes are being prioritised from this framework. The Net Zero Innovation Board[footnote 47], chaired by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, provides the main government forum for discussing prioritisation and spending plans related to net zero research and innovation and will play a key role in assessing progress against the Delivery Plan and this wider Framework. Given the scale of the transformation needed to reach Net Zero by 2050 any framework will necessarily need to adapt and change over time. We cannot, nor would we want to, plan for all the research and innovation needs over the next 30 years. Breakthrough technologies could revolutionise our understanding and approaches in some areas. Government, as well as business, will need to be agile and able to pivot our plans in the future. However, by publishing the UK\u2019s first Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework, we hope to provide fresh impetus to those goals, in the next 5 to 10 years, where it is known that research and innovation is urgently needed and drawing a line of sight from these out to 2050. A detailed plan for delivery against this Framework will follow. Endnotes","filter_flag":1}
