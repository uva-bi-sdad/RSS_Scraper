Whether it be in the form of solar, wind, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, or biofuel, these businesses are not only working to reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also offer potentially promising investment possibilities. Here are 5 renewable energy companies to look out for in 2023. \u2014 The market for renewable energy was valued at $881.7 billion in 2020, and Allied Market Research estimates that it will nearly double in size by 2030. In addition, their analysis shows that 7% of the world\u2019s energy needs are currently met by all renewable energy sources put together. Renewable energy sources will continue to be primarily used to produce electricity, which is anticipated to make up over 30% of the world\u2019s electricity demand this year. The largest contribution, hydropower, is expected to account for 16% of the world\u2019s electricity needs, followed by wind, solar, and biofuels at 6%, 4%, and 3%, respectively.

Canadian Solar Canadian Solar Inc. is a solar energy company with headquarters in Ontario that specialises in the design, production, and sale of solar modules, inverters, system kits, and utility-level products. The company, which was founded in 2001, has subsidiaries across six continents and has active clients in over 160 nations. The business adheres to fair trade practices and neither buys conflict minerals nor uses child labor. For Canadian Solar, the well-being of its more than 13,500 workers is of utmost importance. It also takes environmental protection and conservation very seriously. In fact, the business keeps reducing the amount of water and electricity used during the production process in an effort to stop climate change. Additionally, the company incorporated the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into its business plan by doing things like providing solar panels to a hospital in Sierra Leone. 2. Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (BEP) Located in Canada, Brookfield Renewable is a company that owns and manages renewable energy assets. The corporation has a global portfolio of renewable energy-generating installations. In addition to its primarily focused on hydroelectric power operations, it also owns and manages wind, solar, distributed generation, and storage facilities. Currently, the company employs more than 3,200 employees just in its renewable energy division. It is a leader in the field of renewable energy and one of the biggest producers of hydroelectricity, which accounted for 50% of the company\u2019s portfolio in 2022. Moreover, Brookfield\u2019s portfolio, like other companies on this list, has made significant strides in reducing its emissions. More specifically, the company is able to save about 29 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the emissions of approximately 6 million vehicles. Around 6,000 power-generating facilities with a combined capacity of about 24,000MW spread across North America, South America, Asia, India, China, and Europe are part of this renewable power business. 3. Vestas Wind Systems Vestas Wind Systems is a Denmark-based wind energy company. It creates, produces, and installs wind turbines. The business also runs a service component that offers service contracts, replacement parts, and related services. The company provides wind turbines for numerous nations across the world. By designing, producing, installing, developing, and maintaining wind energy and hybrid projects all around the world, 29,000 employees contribute to making the world a better place every single day. Their sustainable energy solutions have already prevented 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 from being released into the environment and contributed to a more sustainable energy system, with +145GW of wind turbines installed in 85 countries. 4. Clearway Energy One of the biggest owners of renewable energy generating facilities in the US is Clearway Energy. With extremely effective natural gas-powered facilities, it complements its portfolio of wind and solar energy. Additionally, Clearway sells its power through PPAs, which give the business a consistent stream of income. In 2022, the company sold its thermal division, bringing in $1.35 billion in cash that is being reinvested in the expansion of its operations. Clearway Energy now anticipates that, as a result of its transactions, it will be able to increase its dividend toward the high end of its target range of 5 to 8% annually through at least 2026. It plans to keep up it\u2019s good financial standing in the interim. In the upcoming years, the company is expected to further expand its activities in the renewable energy sector while also generating significant value for shareholders. 5. SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) Last on our list of renewable energy companies is SolarEdge Technologies, an Israeli-based company founded in 2006. SEDG specialises in inverter systems for solar projects all around the world. The business has also started to develop other smart energy solutions using its experience in inverters. Through a series of acquisitions, it has increased the range of products it offers. These new products and services address a number of energy market segments, including solar, storage, electric vehicle charging, batteries, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), electric vehicle powertrains, and grid services solutions. Although SolarEdge presently rules the solar hardware market, its future is likely to be influenced by energy storage. Developers of residential solar energy systems like SunPower, Sunrun, and Tesla are combining their energy storage systems into what are essentially power plants that can provide electricity as needed. In order to add value to all parties and establish a long-term new cash flow stream, they can charge an in-home energy storage system while power is cheap and discharge into the grid when electricity is expensive using control systems.

In the study, CEOs forewarn about the impact of converging setbacks for business and society, from faltering multilateralism and socioeconomic instability to supply-chain interruptions and the immediate effects of climate change. \u201cIn a world categorized by conflict, energy shortages, rising inflation and the threat of recession, this year\u2019s study shows CEOs do not believe the world is as resilient to crises as we may have hoped. Businesses continue to be impacted by multiple shocks. As a result, on a broad range of issues, from runaway climate change to widening social and economic inequalities, business action right now does not match the ambition and pace needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030,\u201d said Sanda Ojiambo, Assistant Secretary General, CEO and Executive Director UN Global Compact. As these challenges stack up, CEOs point to global issues that traditionally lie outside the corporate sphere\u2014such as climate change or socio-political conflicts\u2014as reasons for worry over delivering value and impact for all stakeholders. With only eight years left to rescue the SDGs, nearly half (43%) of CEOs globally say their sustainability efforts have been hampered due to the geopolitical environment, with that number even higher for CEOs from developing countries (51%). When examining net zero targets set by the world\u2019s largest companies, Accenture also found that nearly all will miss their own targets unless they double the rate of carbon emissions reductions by 2030. However, some CEOs continue to make a great impact and show clear pockets of success that deliver shared stakeholder value and competitive advantage in their industries and are reshaping the future of sustainable development through innovation and collaboration. Two-thirds of CEOs (66%) say their companies are engaging in long-term strategic partnerships to build resilience. These leaders are reconfiguring underlying supply chains, reskilling their workforces, reassessing their relationship with natural resources, and reimagining planetary boundaries through breakthroughs in technology spanning physical, digital and biological solutions. \u201cNot meeting the promise of the SDGs is a real concern but, at the same time, an enormous opportunity for companies that reinvent their enterprises and harness sustainability as one of the key forces of change in the next decade,\u201d said Peter Lacy, Accenture\u2019s global Sustainability Services lead and chief responsibility officer. \u201cCEOs are clearly concerned about resilience, but one leader\u2019s resilience is another leader\u2019s growth opportunity. New waves of technology investments and breakthrough innovation can put the SDGs back within reach \u2013 but only if leaders turn to sustainability for resilience to help create new markets, products and services that can correct the current trajectory and drive growth amid times of disruption.\u201d CEOs also identify a clear need to focus on technology for finding solutions to tackle global challenges and drive growth. Leading CEOs are already embedding sustainability into their businesses through launching new products and services for sustainability (63%), enhancing sustainability data collection across their value chains (55%) and investing in renewable energy sources (49%). Nearly half (49%) are transitioning to circular business models, and 40% are increasing R&D funding for sustainable innovation. In their interviews, CEOs identify key initiatives to build resilience for companies, from establishing science-based climate targets and investing in their workforce\u2019s diversity to engaging in cross-industry partnerships on technology solutions, enhancing supply chain visibility and advancing greater biodiversity. Additionally, CEOs continue calling for government engagement on policy changes1 that prioritize long-term measurable objectives as standardized ESG reporting frameworks, a global market for carbon and incentives for sustainable business models. \u201cDespite setbacks, there is room for hope. The CEOs we surveyed increasingly recognize they can build credibility and brand value by committing to the Ten Principles and the Sustainable Development Goals throughout their operations\u2013 not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it is good business sense,\u201d added Ojiambo.

Mechanical recycling is the process used by most towns and cities that does not change the chemical makeup of plastic, whereas chemical recycling has an intense use of heat to change plastics\u2019 chemical makeup. It states that mechanical recycling displays better environmental and economic performances than chemical recycling technologies. The study also said chemical recycling processes have worse environmental and economic outcomes than the production of virgin plastics because of the minimal production of \u201crecycled\u201d plastics they produce compared to the input of energy and materials. According to the study, chemical recycling can be 10-100 times worse for the environment than virgin plastic production. It also points out that the claim that chemical recycling can infinitely recycle plastic is not true because only 1%-14% of the plastic material is recycled into new products. This is an important study because plastic industry advocates are working to add chemical recycling into recycling legislation at the state level. They propose it as part of the solution to the plastic crisis when in reality it causes worse environmental impacts than virgin plastic. Chemical recycling advocates label this process as advanced recycling and so far 21 states have either classified it as a manufacturing process instead of waste disposal or eased air quality regulations around the process because it is perceived as environmentally friendly. PIRG is working in many states to mitigate this rollback of environmental standards and reduce the need for plastic in the first place. Check out our other plastic campaigns here.","filter_flag":1}

Countries are looking at gas alternatives like green hydrogen, tidal energy, and wind power. But solar remains the front runner with the most significant capacity to generate energy for homes and businesses and replenish national grids. The European Commission's REPowerEU plan mandates the installation of rooftop solar panels on new public and commercial buildings and new residential buildings by 2029. But while solar power should be the biggest generator of power in the future, there are challenges to reaching this goal. And Europe's startups are providing a way forward to solve some of the industry's most complex challenges. Improve the carbon footprint of solar panels While solar panels have green cred, there's always room for improvement. Dutch startup Solarge has developed a new technique to manufacture lightweight solar panels without using aluminium or glass. In partnership with industry manufacturers, the solar panels have a carbon footprint 80% better than conventional modules, free from toxic materials, and 50% lower in weight than other modules, expanding potential use cases. They can be easily disassembled at the end of life and are suitable for upcycling. What happens to solar panels after they die? Today's commercial solar panels have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years, meaning panels installed in the 1990s are retiring. But dismantling and recycling them is not as simple as taking them to a recycling facility. Each solar panel contains layers of precious mined metals such as silver, copper, and aluminium as well polysilicon. Extracting these materials is traditionally imprecise and time-consuming, reducing their value and increasing their carbon footprint. In response, French startup ROSI solar has developed a way to extract and salvage the valuable materials inside each photovoltaic panel. A thermal process removes the polymers that hold the materials with each solar panel together. Then the materials are mechanically sorted, recovering the photovoltaic cells, which contain high-purity silicon and silver wires. Once recovered, these can be reused in the solar panel supply chain or made into other products. This circular design process extends the materials' lifespan and reduces the reliance on mining metals. Extend the life of solar panels Startups are also looking at ways to expand the lifespan of solar panels. Traditional maintenance is a time-consuming manual process or involves flying drones over rooftops. Some providers opt to replace panels entirely rather than foot the repair cost, increasing their carbon footprint. In response, Clever Solar Devices is a Spanish startup focused on what it calls Photovoltaics 4.0. It uses patented hardware and AI-embedded software to diagnose the health of individual solar panels, measuring the health of each automatically in real-time and remotely without interrupting production This makes it possible to detect which specific photovoltaic modules are defective and replace them accordingly. A second life for retired solar panels While startups are working to extend the lifespan and usability of individual solar panel materials, there's also scope for reusing them to create new products. German startup SunCrafter has developed technology to give solar panels from industrial solar farms a second life in the form of new products. By applying a proprietary IP-protected remanufacturing process to degrading solar modules, they are transformed into plug-and-play photovoltaic systems. These can charge any 12-volt electrical device or battery and run for decades without maintenance or repair. But challenges await While there are thousands of solar startups in Europe, there are still challenges confronting the industry that need to be met for the region to meet its climate commitments. For example, last year, research by the European trade association SolarPower Europe found that employee numbers would need to double from 2021's figure of 466,000 to over 1 million to meet Europe's solar goals. Thus, there needs to be substantial investment in training future employees in manufacturing, sales, installation, analysis, and maintenance \u2013 and continual upskilling as technological advancements in solar energy evolve. This is a role where edtech startups focused on both practical and digital education can have a meaningful presence. Further, material delays and supply chain challenges impact all industries. Startups dedicated to reducing supply chain bottle networks and improving the transportation of goods and materials (examples include Solvo.ai and SHIPSTA will have an important role to play if Europe is to achieve its aims. It's questionable whether Europe can meet its solar goals on schedule. Still, any efforts to advance the composition of solar panels, extend their lifespan and improve their sustainability will reinforce their value in mitigating the impacts of climate change.","filter_flag":1}

Structural supply-chain issues, rising interest rates, and sustainability challenges are just a few conditions that have become the new norm and hold critical implications for business models. Amid this much change, merely trying to manage costs and raise productivity is unlikely to overcome the growth challenge that seven out of eight organizations face today. Instead, companies need to find emerging pockets of growth that can help them secure long-term success. Innovation is critical to achieving that goal. Enduring outperformance requires management teams to refocus innovation efforts on fresh opportunities for growth and diversification\u2014and to develop new products, invest in new business models, and forge new partnerships to seize those opportunities. By taking defensive measures such as conserving cash while also going on the offense, \u201cambidextrous leaders\u201d create value despite volatility, setting up their organizations to thrive in a world that has likely changed in fundamental ways. Indeed, our research and experience show that companies tend to fall behind if they focus solely on avoiding the downside. Since the start of the Great Recession in 2008, North American and European companies that controlled operating costs while also prioritizing revenue growth have delivered far more value to shareholders than their industry peers (Exhibit 1). To capture growth opportunities while creating more strategic options in a fast-changing environment, innovation is key. Many companies are already acting: in our 2021 New Business Building Survey, respondents reported that, on average, they expect half of their revenues in the next five years to come from entirely new products, services, and businesses. 1 Innovation has always been essential to long-term value creation and resilience because it creates countercyclical and noncyclical revenue streams. Paradoxically, making big innovation bets may now be safer than investing in incremental changes. Our long-standing research shows that innovation success rests on the mastery of eight essential practices. Five of these practices are particularly important today: resetting the aspiration based on the viability of current businesses, choosing the right portfolio of initiatives, discovering ways to differentiate value propositions and move into adjacencies, evolving business models, and extending efforts to include external partners. Raise your innovation aspiration to address new risks and opportunities In recent years, the assumptions underpinning many business lines and growth initiatives have changed or broken down entirely. Companies with business models optimized to a specific set of global conditions are more vulnerable to the sea change underway and need to invest more, not less, in innovation to open new paths of viability. We have already seen this play out in the shortages affecting consumer goods, retail, and auto sectors, and as the energy crisis expands, disruptions are impacting more industries. Conversely, business models that address today\u2019s uncertainties through reshoring production or expanding into digital offerings, for example, can help companies ride out disruptions. In effect, the risks associated with business as usual versus bold innovation have been inverted: in times of fundamental change, shifting resources toward big innovation bets is an important hedge against uncertainty (Exhibit 2). 2 We saw this timeless pattern play out in earlier cycles. For instance, amid the 2002 downturn, Best Buy recognized it couldn\u2019t win on assortment breadth and competitive pricing alone so it invested in business model innovation, creating and scaling their Geek Squad consumer support service that other online and brick and mortar rivals couldn\u2019t easily provide. Two decades later, a European energy company likewise facing a declining core business recently opted to move into a high-growth and high-innovation segment by expanding into renewable energy in other markets. The energy crisis is pushing even distant sectors to embrace innovation. Take beer: the carbon dioxide used for carbonation is a byproduct of ammonia production, an energy-intensive process employed mostly in the manufacture of fertilizer. High energy prices in Europe have stalled ammonia production, creating a shortage of carbon dioxide at the peak of the region\u2019s beer season. While some European brewers opted to shut down, others have instead embraced process innovation by exploring nitrogen or other means of creating beer foam. Choose a balanced portfolio of short- and long-term innovations In times of disruption or deep uncertainty, companies have to carefully balance short-term innovations aimed at cost reductions and potential breakthrough bets. As customers\u2019 demands change, overindexing on small product tweaks (that address needs which may be temporary) is unlikely to boost long-term performance. However, \u201crenovations\u201d to designs and processes can produce savings that help fund longer-term investments in innovations that may create routes to profitable growth. For example, when a consumer packaged goods company found itself falling short of its growth and margin targets but lacked capital to invest in new offerings, a cross-functional team built road maps for both immediate and longer-term product offerings. Within four months, the company sized the financial impact and execution feasibility of cost-reducing quick wins such as package optimization and formula rationalization as well as more ambitious projects, including a shift to sustainable packaging and entirely new products. The cost reductions from the incremental innovations yielded funds the company could reinvest in longer-term growth ideas while an innovation process reduced product development timelines by 75 percent. Similarly, when a global manufacturer of sinks and faucets found itself falling behind competitors, it conducted a review of its innovation portfolio. The company found it had a limited innovation pipeline to feed new growth and that 65 percent of employees were focused on largely incremental projects expected to contribute only 5 percent to the portfolio\u2019s net present value (NPV). The management team then sought to rebalance the portfolio toward bolder, higher-NPV initiatives, including bottom-up product redesigns to reduce the time to market. After reallocating resources to projects with higher commercial potential, the company saw a threefold increase in revenue and reduced the time to market for new products by nearly 40 percent. Discover and tap into emerging adjacencies Pervasive uncertainty is a good opportunity for companies to look for diversification or expansion opportunities outside their core businesses. Economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions have led numerous organizations to tap innovation opportunities in adjacent markets, such as grocers ramping up delivery options. Similarly, mobility-as-a-service providers have found a valuable new niche in delivering restaurant food, and some electric vehicle manufacturers are now monetizing battery production and recycling. A May 2021 McKinsey survey revealed that during the first 12 months of the pandemic, top-decile economic performers innovated nearly twice as fast as their low-performing peers in generating new products and services (Exhibit 3). 3 Our recent research shows that adjacencies closer to the core business and current competencies tend to be easier to capture but can still represent significant new sources of growth. Some agricultural companies, for example, have shifted from selling farming machinery and fertilizer to building ecosystems and providing insights to help farmers be more productive. Drug and medical device manufacturers likewise are increasingly looking beyond selling medications and machines to helping patients manage their conditions and live longer, healthier lives through end-to-end care journeys. Today, the sustainability imperative is driving many such innovation bets. Consumers\u2019 concern about climate change is leading packaged goods companies to invest in sustainable ingredients and packaging, while some clothing manufacturers are recycling old clothes to make new ones. Sometimes, regulations can spur innovations in adjacent markets. For example, tax credits under 45Q, a section of the US federal tax code enacted in 2008, encourage investments in carbon capture and storage. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, meanwhile, creates opportunities in sustainable fuels and chemicals for firms that can leverage these incentives to build new businesses. Similarly, the European Union\u2019s decarbonization goals under Roadmap 2050 have created significant incentives to innovation. As industry landscapes shift and customer demands evolve, incumbents should look for innovation opportunities with the mindset of start-ups. Expecting revenue or margin growth to continue as before can prevent bold action and invite attackers that view established companies\u2019 margins as opportunity. Evolve business models for changing conditions Capturing new opportunities\u2014either by aligning with emerging trends or venturing into adjacent markets\u2014often requires business model changes, which can have the added benefit of boosting resilience. Adopting new business models can enable companies to put more core competencies into play than investments further afield while also making the organization more adaptable and generating new growth. Such innovations can include evolutions of value propositions, economic models, production models, routes to market, and the use of assets and capabilities. For example, new ways to organize supply chains or ecosystems, shifting from selling products to offering services, or moving from B2B to B2C can give companies new strategic options as business conditions change. Energy companies that pivoted to providing locally produced, renewable energy, for instance, are finding the shift insulates their operations from near-term swings in energy prices. Similarly, organizations moving to provide products to increasingly health-conscious consumers are by necessity diversifying their supply bases to acquire the needed ingredients, thus improving the resilience of their supply chains. Such tactical gains often bring strategic benefits. For example, one shoe manufacturer is now offering recyclable shoes on subscription\u2014a customer returns a pair at the end of the lease and the company uses the materials to construct the next batch. Extend efforts to include external partners Over the past three years, top economic performers have doubled down on investments in new partnerships (Exhibit 4). Alliances and joint ventures can enable large companies to rapidly scale new business models or offerings that would take a long time to develop organically. 4 The current market volatility can provide fresh opportunities for large companies to extend their networks of business partners, or even acquire them. With many start-ups struggling and lower availability of venture capital, incumbents can help fill the funding gap while gaining access to important capabilities and technologies. For example, a European energy management company teamed up with a private equity firm on a joint venture that builds and operates clients\u2019 energy infrastructure. The new business helps organizations make the transition to renewable energy sources, for example by helping fleet operators shift to zero-emissions vehicles. In times of increasing disruption and uncertainty, continuing with business as usual can exceed the risk of leaning into the headwinds. To join the ranks of the truly resilient and enable through-cycle growth, now is the time to choose a new innovation portfolio, discover fresh insights and opportunities, and evolve your business models.","filter_flag":1}

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information: This media release contains \"forward-looking\" statements regarding the business operations and prospects of Darling Ingredients Inc. and industry factors affecting it. These statements are identified by words such as \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"planned,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"momentum,\" \"combined adjusted EBITDA guidance\" and other words referring to events that may occur in the future. These statements reflect Darling Ingredient's current view of future events and are based on its assessment of, and are subject to, a variety of risks and uncertainties beyond its control, each of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, existing and unknown future limitations on the ability of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries to make their cash flow available to the Company for payments on the Company's indebtedness or other purposes; global demands for bio-fuels and grain and oilseed commodities, which have exhibited volatility, and can impact the cost of feed for cattle, hogs and poultry, thus affecting available rendering feedstock and selling prices for the Company's products; reductions in raw material volumes available to the Company due to weak margins in the meat production industry as a result of higher feed costs, reduced consumer demand or other factors, reduced volume from food service establishments, or otherwise; reduced demand for animal feed; reduced finished product prices, including a decline in fat and used cooking oil finished product prices; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas(\"GHG\") emissions that adversely affect programs like the U.S. government's renewable fuel standard, low carbon fuel standards (\"LCFS\") and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad; possible product recall resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food or food additives; the occurrence of 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as \"Swine Flu\"), Highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as \"Bird Flu\"), severe acute respiratory syndrome (\"SARS\"), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or \"BSE\"), porcine epidemic diarrhea (\"PED\") or other diseases associated with animal origin in the United States or elsewhere, such as the outbreak of African Swine Fever (\"ASF\") in China and elsewhere; the occurrence of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak; unanticipated costs and\/or reductions in raw material volumes related to the Company's compliance with the existing or unforeseen new U.S. or foreign (including, without limitation, China) regulations (including new or modified animal feed, Bird Flu, SARS, PED, BSE, ASF or similar or unanticipated regulations) affecting the industries in which the Company operates or its value added products; risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture, including possible unanticipated operating disruptions and issues relating to the announced capital project; risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protections imposed by foreign countries; difficulties or a significant disruption in our information systems or failure to implement new systems and software successfully, risks relating to possible third party claims of intellectual property infringement; increased contributions to the Company's pension and benefit plans, including multiemployer and employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as required by legislation, regulation or other applicable U.S. or foreign law or resulting from a U.S. mass withdrawal event; bad debt write-offs; loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations; continued or escalated conflict in the Middle East, North Korea, Ukraine or elsewhere, including the Russia-Ukraine war; uncertainty regarding the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and\/or unfavorable export or import markets. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, climate conditions, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements included in this release or negatively impact the Company's results of operations. Among other things, future profitability may be affected by the Company's ability to grow its business, which faces competition from companies that may have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and purchases of shares under the program are subject to market conditions and other factors, which are likely to change from time to time. Other risks and uncertainties regarding Darling Ingredients Inc., its business and the industries in which it operates are referenced from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Darling Ingredients Inc. is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Built around EcoFlow's powerful DELTA Pro portable power station, the Whole-home Backup Power Solution is a quiet and reliable portable home battery setup that replaces noisy, polluting generators. From left to right: EcoFlow Blade Robotic Lawn-sweeping Mower, EcoFlow Glacier Portable Refrigerator, EcoFlow Wave 2 Portable Air Conditioner. EcoFlow's Whole-home Backup Power Solution providing power for a household during a power outage. The setup is available in three different capacities and works across EcoFlow's broader ecosystem to deliver affordable, clean and reliable energy, providing peace of mind in these times of increasing energy insecurity. EcoFlow also launched three new outdoor smart devices at CES \u2014 the 2nd-gen Wave 2 Portable Air Conditioner, as well as CES 2023 Honorees, Blade, a robotic lawn-sweeping mower, and Glacier, a portable fridge with a built-in ice maker and battery. The new products reflect EcoFlow's commitment to powering people's lives on and off the grid. \"Rising power bills and extreme weather events have created an increasingly unstable energy situation for many people around the world. The pandemic also created a surge of interest in camping and other outdoor events,\" said Brian Essenmacher, EcoFlow's head of business development. \"EcoFlow is addressing these new demands and challenges by providing power that's easier than ever and helping people to make the most of life by saving them time and money. We're making life more enjoyable at home and outdoors.\" Whole-home Backup Power for Lasting Peace of Mind Many people rely on gas-powered generators as their emergency power solution during blackouts. These generators are noisy, smoky and produce high levels of dangerous carbon monoxide. EcoFlow's new Whole-home Backup Power Solution, on the other hand, provides backup power that is clean, quiet and safe. The Whole-home Backup Power Solution is built around DELTA Pro, a powerful portable power station that can be fully recharged with a wall socket in under 3 hours. The Advanced Kit, one of three different solution bundles to meet customers' individual needs, connects two DELTA Pro units via the Double Voltage Hub, resulting in a massive 7200W and 240V output. That's enough to power practically any home appliance while delivering enough energy to keep critical circuits running for up to a week. Alternatively, customers can get through even the worst blackouts with an even longer-lasting power supply by pairing the setup with EcoFlow's Smart Generator (Dual Fuel). The Whole-home Backup Solution can be used with EcoFlow's range of solar generators to provide free renewable energy and help users reduce their reliance on the grid. What's more, as part of the U.S. government's Inflation Reduction Act 2022, it is possible for users to apply for a 30% tax credit when installing the DELTA Pro as a home power solution.* With just a few modules, the Whole-home Backup Power Solution is easy for people to install in homes and RVs without the need for professional installers like other power backup products. The Whole-home Backup Power Solution will be available in the U.S. on EcoFlow's website beginning Jan. 5. An alternative home backup solution for users in the E.U., comprising EcoFlow's Power Kits and Smart Home Panel, will also be available soon. Three New Smart Devices for Next-Level Living As a hotbed of the latest innovation where ideas become reality, CES 2023 provided the ideal setting for EcoFlow to demonstrate how its growing ecosystem of smart devices improves life at home and outdoors. The three new products unveiled today include: EcoFlow Blade: The world's first robotic lawn-sweeping mower capable of collecting fallen leaves. EcoFlow Blade is cheaper than professional mowing services and requires less manual lawn maintenance compared to standard robotic mowers.

(hereinafter \u201cNGK\u201d) has decided on a policy of introducing photovoltaic equipment (\u201cPV\u201d) with a total capacity of 40 MW at manufacturing sites in Japan and overseas by fiscal 2025. Consuming renewable energy generated in-house will contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality by cutting annual CO 2 emissions by 22,000 tons. The NGK Group aims to realize net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 through the NGK Group Environmental Vision formulated in April 2021. To achieve this goal, it has drawn up its Carbon Neutrality Strategic Roadmap which sets cutting emissions by 25% compared to fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2025 as an intermediate target. As one of its strategies for meeting this target, the Group is installing PV within the Group and working to procure renewable energy. As part of PV installation efforts, a decision has been made to install PV at the Group\u2019s main overseas manufacturing subsidiaries in Poland and Thailand. NGK CERAMICS POLSKA SP. Z O.O. will install large-scale PV with a total capacity of 15.1 MW on the roof of the buildings and on land at its first factory (Gliwice, Silesia Province), as well as on land neighboring its second factory (D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza, Silesia Province). It is anticipated that these will produce an annual output of 15,240 MWh, which will reduce annual CO 2 emissions by an estimated 10,000 tons in fiscal 2024, the first full year after the installation. NGK CERAMICS (THAILAND) CO., LTD. (Samutprakarn Province) will install large-scale PV with a total capacity of 4.25 MW on the rooftops of its buildings, which is expected to produce an annual output of 5,560 MWh. Operation is due to start in fiscal 2023 and it will reduce annual CO 2 emissions by an estimated 2,630 tons. The Group\u2019s plan is to switch all energy consumed by overseas manufacturing sites to renewable energy by fiscal 2025, including by actively installing PV. In addition to efforts for reducing CO 2 emissions currently underway, such as installing PV, acquiring Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), and introducing carbon-neutral city gas, the Group is also launching initiatives including developing technology for manufacturing ceramics using clean energy sources that do not emit CO 2 , such as hydrogen and ammonia. To achieve net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050, NGK will advance various initiatives in regions around the world, including the further installation of PV within the Group and the effective use of renewable energy through storage using NAS\u00ae batteries, to contribute to the realization of a carbon neutral society.

NGK Insulators (NGK), the world\u2019s leading ceramics technology company, is one such challenger. Adapting to and adopting megatrends On the face of it, an energy-intensive manufacturer which generates a substantial chunk of its sales from products to filter out exhaust from internal combustion engines would seem an unlikely champion for transitioning to a decarbonised and digitalised future. But it surprisingly is. To start with, NGK is slashing its own emissions at a dramatic pace. This year, the company switched to using renewable energy in all its European factories, and is aiming to achieve the same for all factories outside Japan by 2025. It aims to achieve carbon neutrality across all operations by 2050. Simultaneously, the company is pivoting towards producing smart, fossil-fuel-free solutions for other applications. \u201cThe world is currently moving towards a carbon-neutral, digital society. We already possess many products and technologies for these areas,\u201d says Shigeru Kobayashi, NGK\u2019s president. \u201cWe will continue to apply our advanced technologies in responding to issues such as energy and the environment to meet the expectations of our global society.\u201d Such solutions include the grid-scale NAS* battery to contribute to renewable energy storage; subnano-ceramic membranes to capture carbon dioxide at molecular level; and ultra-thin EnerCera* batteries to enable maintenance-free IoT devices. Moreover, the company supplies vital ceramics products used in semiconductor manufacturing, data centres, and mobile phones, among other electronic devices.

Later, I\u2019d spot a coyote skittering across the parking lot. But down the dirt road at the site, the Old West vibes quickly fell away, replaced by a sense of urgency radiating from nearly everyone there. Several massive buildings were under construction, and engineers and construction workers in safety vests and hard hats hurried around the site, ducking between temporary trailers serving as makeshift offices, labs, and meeting rooms. When construction is finished, the Redwood site will produce two major products: the copper foil for anodes and a mixture of lithium, nickel, and cobalt known as cathode active material. These components account for over half the cost of battery cells. By 2025, Redwood projects, its facility will produce enough of them to make batteries for more than a million EVs every year. Down the hill from the trailers, the building for copper foil production was the furthest along, with a roof and walls; a machine for making the foil was tucked away in the corner. But the two other major buildings still looked far from completion\u2014one was missing walls, and the other was only a foundation. Redwood has big plans and plenty of construction ahead. \u201cA sense of paranoia\u201d Redwood Materials was founded by JB Straubel, who as Tesla\u2019s chief technical officer during the early 2010s led many of the company\u2019s battery breakthroughs, including the beginnings of its network of charging stations. But even as Tesla was transforming the way electric cars were manufactured and sold, Straubel was worried about how overwhelming the need for more battery materials would become. He began to think of ways to lower the cost of batteries and help reduce the carbon emissions associated with making them. Straubel started Redwood while still working at Tesla (he left in 2019); he wanted, as he puts it, to create a sustainable battery materials company. These days he talks about his mission with a breathless excitement coupled with the precision of an engineer, sometimes pausing in the middle of a thought to start over as he explains his vision for the future of battery production. \u201cIt simply can\u2019t work unless you have a closed loop for the raw materials,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough new raw materials to keep building and throwing them away.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Tesla's energy business has been on a steady rise, with the company's Q4 2022 financial results showing significant growth in its energy storage deployment. According to the company's release, Tesla deployed a record 2.4 GWh of energy storage in Q4, which is up 152% compared to the same period in 2021 and 300 MW more than the previous quarter. This brings the company's total energy storage deployment for the year to an impressive 6.5 GWn, up 64% compared to 2021. I don't think Tesla's energy business has been factored into the share price at all. Yet, The energy business actually makes renewables practical and can be used in conjunction with convention power generation. Also, utilities are immune from the macroeconomic environment. Should be huge when the street finds out. While Tesla's solar division also had a good quarter with 100 MW deployed, it is the company's energy storage products - Powerwalls and Megapacks - that have truly shined. The Powerwall is a compact and affordable home battery system that allows homeowners to store and use their own solar energy, while the Megapack is a large-scale battery system designed for utilities and other commercial customers. Wall Street Seems To Ignore Tesla's Energy Business Boom So, despite the impressive numbers, Tesla's energy business is still not in the radar of Wall Street. However, it is clear that the company's focus on energy storage is paying off, and it is likely to continue to drive growth in the future. As more and more homes and businesses turn to renewable energy sources, the demand for energy storage solutions will only continue to increase. If we assume that Tesla continues to grow its energy storage deployment at the same rate, it is possible that the company could reach 20 GWh of deployment by 2023. This would involve the deployment of 5,000 Megapacks, each of which is estimated to cost $2 million. If the company is able to achieve this level of deployment and maintain a 20% gross margin, this would result in $10 billion in revenue and $2 billion in profit for the company. $TSLA energy business is not on WS\u2019s radar. Even if we assume 20 GWh deployment (5K megapacks) @ $2M each @ 20% GM that\u2019s $10B rev and $2B profit (~$.50\/share) increm 2024 EPS. @MartinViecha https:\/\/t.co\/gyBHAZ809s\u2014 Gary Black (@garyblack00) January 28, 2023 While it's true that these numbers are speculative, they do demonstrate the potential for Tesla's energy business to become a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue and profit. As the energy storage market continues to grow, it is likely that Wall Street will begin to pay more attention to Tesla's energy business and recognize its potential as a significant source of revenue and profit for the company. This is what Tesla wrote about its energy storage business in its Q4 shareholder\u2019s letter: \u201cEnergy storage deployments increased by 152% YoY in Q4 to 2.5 GWh, for a total deployment of 6.5 GWh in 2022, by far the highest level of deployments we have achieved. Demand for our storage products remains in excess of our ability to supply. We are in the process of ramping production at our dedicated 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California to address the growing demand. This factory should help to further accelerate growth of energy storage deployments.\" Tesla's Megapack Factory Contributes To The Record Q4 2022 was in part due to the ramp-up of Tesla's Megapack factory in Lathrop, California. However, it's important to note that the factory only began production in the middle of the quarter, so the impact of the factory on Q4 deployment numbers is relatively limited. The full impact of the factory is likely to be felt in 2023, as it takes time for the production of the Megapacks to be converted into deployments at energy storage projects. The Lathrop factory is a key component of Tesla's energy storage strategy, and it is expected to significantly increase the company's production capacity for Megapacks. The factory is also designed to be highly automated and efficient, which should help to keep costs low and improve overall margins. While the impact of the Lathrop factory may not have been fully felt in Q4, it is clear that the factory will play a critical role in helping Tesla to meet the growing demand for energy storage solutions. As the energy storage market continues to grow, the Lathrop factory will be instrumental in helping Tesla to scale its production of Megapacks and capitalize on this growth. The ramp-up of this factory is an important step in securing Tesla's position as a leading provider of energy storage solutions and driving the growth in the energy division. Tesla's energy storage business is still a relatively small part of the company's overall business, but it is growing quickly. In Q4 2022, the energy storage business surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time, and it is likely to continue to grow in the future. I believe that Tesla will ramp up production at its Megafactory to 40 GWh by the end of 2023, and the company could end up deploying between 15-20 GWh of energy storage this year. This would be a massive increase from the 6.5 GWh deployed in 2022. Additionally, I think that Tesla could also produce Powerwalls at a rate of 4 GWh this year. This would make 2023 a huge year for Tesla's energy storage business, as it will likely be the year that the market starts to take this part of Tesla's business more seriously. The higher volume will likely come with bigger gross margins too, which is another indication of the potential of the energy storage business. As the energy storage market continues to grow, I believe that Tesla's energy storage business will become an increasingly important part of the company's overall business. Tesla's energy business is a clear example of the company's ability to think beyond traditional automotive products and diversify its revenue streams. The company's focus on energy storage and renewable energy is not only good for the environment but also good for business, as it is helping to drive growth and increase shareholder value. In conclusion, Tesla's energy business is on the rise, and the company's Q4 2022 financial results show significant growth in its energy storage deployment. With Powerwalls and Megapacks leading the way, Tesla's energy storage solutions are in high demand, and the company is well-positioned to continue to drive growth in this area in the future. Despite not being in the radar of Wall Street, it's a clear indication of the company's ability to diversify its revenue streams and think beyond traditional automotive products.

The wound-treatment product can easily cover the 3D structure of the hand, so surgeons do not have to tailor the graft, reducing the need for multiple grafts and bulky fixation, and minimizing surgical time. (Photo: Business Wire) \u201cThese products respond to demand from healthcare professionals for easy-to-use, tailor-made solutions, which help improve outcomes, streamline workflows and reduce the time spent in the operating room,\u201d said Kerecis founder and CEO Fertram Sigurjonsson. GraftGuide Mano The GraftGuide product line is intact fish skin that addresses the challenges of burn healing. GraftGuide Mano is designed to fit the shape of a hand. The product can easily cover the complex 3D structure of the hand, so surgeons do not have to tailor the graft. This reduces the need for multiple grafts and bulky fixation, and minimizes surgical time. Unlike similar burn products, once GraftGuide Mano has been applied, patients can begin physical therapy. This is critical to preventing the loss of range of motion post healing and to speeding up recovery. \u201cI can attest to the importance of finding effective and efficient treatments for civilian and military burn injuries and later reconstructive surgery,\u201d said Lt. Col Steven Jeffery, a burn and plastic surgeon with the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and a professor at Birmingham City University in the UK. \u201cTreatment of burn wounds is often incredibly painful for burn victims, and most of these procedures are performed in the operating room where time is of the essence. Because GraftGuide Mano conforms so well to the hand, it enables a faster, more accurate application. This can significantly reduce operating time and improve the outcome and experience for both the patient and the healthcare team.\u201d Dr. Jeffery continued: \u201cI have seen firsthand the benefits of using fish skin grafts for burns, and GraftGuide Mano takes it to the next level with its innovative design. I am excited to incorporate it into my practice and see the positive impact it can have on my patients.\u201d GraftGuide Micro GraftGuide Micro is a fragmented variation of GraftGuide, which allows the intact fish skin to fill large and uneven burn surfaces. With a fragment size of about 1.5 mm, GraftGuide Micro can easily be applied in tight or irregular spaces that are not accessible to meshed or unmeshed sheets. This product retains the 3D structural benefits of a GraftGuide sheet while being easier to apply and better able to cover deep spaces. \u201cI am always looking for new and innovative ways to repair tissue damage and defects. GraftGuide Micro has exceeded my expectations in terms of its handling properties,\u201d said Dr. Jeffery. \u201cThe product is easy to work with and can be molded to fit the needs of each patient. I have already seen positive results in my patients who have received the fish skin graft for both blast and burn injuries where uneven surfaces and loss of soft tissues pose a big problem. I am confident that the fish skin graft will continue to prove effective in a wide range of procedures,\u201d he added. The GraftGuide products are regulated as medical devices and consist of a full-thickness fish dermis that has been processed using Kerecis\u2019 proprietary EnviroIntact\u2122 method. The use of fish skin as a treatment for burns offers numerous benefits, including its ability to help new cells grow and promote the healing process. The device is appropriate for the management of second-degree burns. Educational Presentation About Treating Complex Burn Wounds with Fish Skin Kerecis will be hosting an educational session on fish skin in the treatment of complex burn wounds on January 22, 2023, at the Boswick Burn and Wound Care Symposium in Maui, HI. Dr. Ariel M. Aballay of West Penn Hospital; Dr. Rajiv Sood of Augusta, GA; and Dr. Ram Velamuri of the Firefighters Burn Center will present detailed cases where the various version of GraftGuide have been used to treat complex burns and in reconstructive surgery. About Kerecis Kerecis develops products from fish skin and fatty acids for cellular therapy, tissue regeneration and protection. When grafted or implanted on damaged human tissue, the patented material recruits the body\u2019s own cells and ultimately is converted into living tissue. Because no disease-transfer risk exists between cold-water fish and humans, the Kerecis fish skin is only gently processed with the company\u2019s EnviroIntact\u2122 method and retains its similarity to human tissue. The gentle processing with the EnviroIntact\u2122 method preserves the skin\u2019s original three-dimensional structure, maintaining its inherent natural strength, complexity and molecules (such as fatty acids). Clinical studies have found that the Kerecis products heal wounds faster than competing products. Kerecis is the only approved manufacturer of medical devices containing intact fish skin globally. It is the fastest-growing and one of the top five in the U.S. biologics-skin and dermal-substitute market, according to SmartTRAK Business Intelligence. Kerecis\u2019 expanding product portfolio includes MariGen\u00ae, which is sold to private offices and wound centers to treat diabetic and other chronic wounds; GraftGuide\u00ae, which is mostly sold to burn centers; and SurgiBind\u00ae\/SurgiClose\u00ae, which are used for reconstructive surgery in operating rooms. Kerecis is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The fish skin used in Kerecis products derives from wild and sustainable fish stock caught in pristine Icelandic waters and processed with 100% renewable energy in the town of Isafjordur, close to the Arctic Circle.

This means the plant-based food market is forecasted to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.1 percent over the next four years. The report\u2019s analysts say consumer interest in vegan food is driven by several factors, including expanded research into the health benefits of plant-based diets, rising support from medical professionals, and expanded media coverage of the diet\u2019s advantages. Nensuria Additionally, the analysis points to benefits such as reducing the risk of zoonotic disease and the ability to feed more people with fewer resources. \u201cCustomers can lessen the adverse effects of the food system on the environment, reduce the risk of zoonotic disease and antibiotic resistance, and feed more people with fewer resources by producing meat from plants, fermentation, or cultivation of actual animal cells,\u201d the report says. With environmentalism top of mind for many consumers, the report notes that by adopting a vegan diet, consumers can also help minimize air and water pollution, slow biodiversity loss, and protect the oceans. Unsplash \u201cVegan diets are the future of the food industry, just as renewable energy sources are the future of the energy industry,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs the international community works to reduce climate risks, vegan foods represent a vast opportunity to help humans achieve net-zero emissions, however, more funding and open-access R&D are required.\u201d Vegan food on a global scale The report notes that the vegan industry experienced its most active growth in 2021, and many signs point to this as the beginning of a race for new vegan products on a global scale. Key companies driving the market include Beyond Meat, Daring Foods, and Impossible Foods. \u201cNew developments in the vegan sector emerge every year, paving the way for a global transition to a much more just, safe and sustainable food system,\u201d the report states. The growing availability of vegan food products in mainstream supermarkets as more mainstream processors enter this market are two more important factors driving growth. Pea-based vegan meat also has a sizable market share, the report notes, likely because of its reasonable price, versatility, and nutritional profile, as well as its widespread availability and applicability. Stateside, the vegan food market is innovating rapidly alongside the global sector. According to a 2021 vegan market analysis by non-profit organization Good Food Institute (GFI), plant-based products are a key driver of sales growth at grocery retailers nationwide, growing three times as fast as overall food sales. SPINS retail sales data released March 22, 2022, shows that grocery sales of plant-based foods that directly replace animal products grew 6 percent the previous year\u2014and 54 percent over three years\u2014to $7.4 billion. Additionally plant-based foods have outpaced total foods in both dollar and unit sales for the past three years. Beyond Meat The report also notes that plant-based meat and seafood dollar sales grew 74 percent since 2018 to $1.4 billion. \u201cAs appetites grow for different plant-based meat types and formats, the category continues to expand and diversify,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe plant-based meat market today is, in ways, reminiscent of the plant-based milk market when it was in its early stages.\u201d While plant-based milk currently accounts for 16 percent of all dollar sales for retail milk, the study says that with continued product innovation the vegan meat category has the potential to earn a similar share of the total meat market, representing a 14-point growth in the share which is worth $16 billion. Vegan seafood sees innovation And although vegan seafood remained a small fraction of plant-based meat sales in 2021, the following year saw greater innovation in the category. According to the first-ever State of the Industry Report of vegan seafood by GFI, $175 million was raised globally by companies in 2021, a 92 percent increase from 2020. Loma Linda GFI suggests that alternative seafood remains a market whitespace and is well poised to capitalize on the momentum of the broader plant-based industry. And widespread commercialization of alternative seafood is a promising approach to alleviating pressure on both wild fisheries and aquaculture systems while helping to meet global demand for an important source of food. \u201cEvery year, we see advancements in the alternative protein industry that are opening the door for a global shift to a far more sustainable, secure, and just food system than the one we have today,\u201d the report update notes. \u201cLike 2019 and 2020 before it, 2021 was the most active year yet for growth in the alternative protein industry, and many signs indicate that the world is on the cusp of a global race for alternative protein innovation.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The startup is certainly making an impact, helping create a more sustainable energy future for Europe and positively impacting the planet as a result. As the new year rolls in, it\u2019s a time to reflect and consider the changes we can make for the better \u2013 changes in approaches and perspectives that can have more positive impacts on our lives and society. One major thing we all need to reflect on, and something we are increasingly considering, is the climate crisis. In 2022, the gravity of the escalating crisis came to a pinnacle as the energy system across the continent came under never-seen-before pressure and the reality of the fragility of our society came to light. Now, across the continent, the urgency of transitioning to more stable, more dependable and more planet-positive energy alternatives has reached an all-time high. Renewable energy sources are the future \u2013 there can be no doubt about that \u2013 and there is a range of options available. The challenge is to make access to these sources available to everyone across the continent and to do so fast and without friction. Berlin-based Enpal aims to help achieve this, accelerating the energy transition with accessible solar technology. It was Germany\u2019s first \u2018green\u2019 unicorn and has already gotten the backing of the stars of the climate action space, including Leonardo DiCaprio. Now, the startup has secured an additional cash investment, getting 2023 off to a bright start. Enpal founder and CEO Mario Kohle: \u201cFighting climate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st century. We want to help tackle this global issue by putting solar panels on every roof, a battery into every home, and an electric vehicle with a charger in front of every door. We are thrilled to have high-profile global cleantech investors on board to support our mission to make clean energy simple, affordable, and accessible for every household. By joining forces, we can multiply our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and we will pave the way towards a more sustainable society.\u201d Funding details \u20ac215 million raised in growth capital as part of a Series D funding round It was led by TPG Rise Climate with Westly Group and Activate Capital, two additional major climate investors coming on board. Existing investors such as HV Capital (with support from the European Investment Bank), SoftBank Vision Fund II Capital, Princeville Climate Technology, also participated, once again increasing their commitments. It comes just weeks after an \u20ac855 million raise Edward Beckley, Partner at TPG and Senior member of the TPG Rise Climate investing team, said: \u201cEnpal\u2019s success and rapid growth in Germany \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest residential solar market \u2013 puts the company in a great position to grow into new markets, products and services and establish itself as the leading player in the sector. As fossil fuel prices remain elevated and governments enact policy to accelerate the energy transition, we continue to believe in the importance of home decarbonization across Europe. We are delighted to partner with Enpal to bring their user-friendly, end-to-end solution to more homes across Germany and broader Europe.\u201d Founded in 2017, Enpal, led by Mario Kohle, has the vision to make it easier for homeowners to switch to solar energy. It offers a complete package consisting of a solar system, energy storage, its own green electricity tariff and a smart home environment on a subscription basis. Enpal offers the first integrated package for a climate-neutral home including PV systems, energy storage, EV chargers, green electricity tariffs and smart energy managers. What\u2019s more, the company rents out the systems which democratise access to solar energy, taking away often sky-high upfront costs, and also provides an all-inclusive care-free package. Viktor Wingert, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of Enpal, said: \u201cBuilding the largest renewable community is the challenge of our lifetime. We require strong investors and financing partners to continue our path. This latest funding round, in addition to the recently secured 855m EUR in refinancing by Blackrock Alternatives, ING, Pricoa Private Capital, Unicredit and Infranity, puts us in a unique position to grow faster and stronger in 2023 and beyond. Winning the trust of such high-caliber partners in a challenging macroeconomic environment leaves us very humble, but more eager than ever to deliver on our vision.\u201d We chatted with Mario Kohle, the founder and CEO, in 2022 to learn about how he has grown the firm to one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing energy companies in Europe. Back then, he told us to dare to dream big \u2013 and it looks like the company are certainly doing that. It currently counts about 30k customers, installing over 2000 solar energy systems per month. Steve Westly, founder and managing partner of Westly Group: \u201cClean energy has been front and centre of everything we do at Westly Group from day one, and we strongly believe in Enpal\u2019s vision to connect humankind to become a renewable community. We are proud to partner with Enpal on the mission to make renewable energy easy, accessible, and affordable for everyone, and fight the climate crisis on a global scale.\u201d The additional growth capital will allow Enpal to add new products, expand to new markets and further develop Enpal\u2019s multi-awarded smart energy platform. . By responding to the increased customer demand and expanding beyond the German market, Enpal aims to fulfil their vision of creating a global renewable-energy community. Enpal closed 2022 with over \u20ac400 million in revenue. This funding reflects another major milestone and sets the company on track to continue growing profitably whilst delivering a tangible positive impact for European consumers. Jochen Cassel, Chief Financial Officer of Enpal, said: \u201cEnpal has just finished an incredible year: We have successfully quadrupled our growth while for the first time delivering a healthy profit. We are now in full control to continue our growth trajectory, become cash flow positive, and further invest into our customers and products.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The 2023 3D Printing Industry Executive survey broadens the scope and asks 3D printing insiders two questions. What is the greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade? What technology will be required to solve this? Approaches to answering this question varied, some chose to tackle challenges specific to advancing additive manufacturing in the next ten years. At the forefront of executives\u2019 minds are approaches to lowering cost-per-part, ensuring quality is maintained, and how AM can leverage its core advantages to the full? Process Automation and the combination of AI approaches to the additive ecosystem, including intelligent production management systems, part design, and physics-informed neural networks, are covered. How does Moore\u2019s Law relate to 3D printing, and what technologies are on the rise? Tying everything together, a recurrent word: Production. Other respondees take an alternative approach. What is the bigger picture, and how will technology be deployed to address critical global issues such as decarbonization, the electrification of transportation, green energy production and Industry 4.0? What will combining 3D printing with emerging technologies such as computational material discovery, synthetic biology, or robotics yield? Again, a broad range of respondees were surveyed, from end users such as Czinger Vehicles to the largest manufacturers of 3D printing systems, software, and materials. And despite the featured image, not one mentioned flying cars. Settle in and enjoy the insights from the experts below. Engineering challenges for the next decade word cloud.

Subscribe to our free newsletter for regular news, analysis, and insights into additive manufacturing. Want to add your insight? We welcome contributions from everyone in the industry, get in touch. Dr. Brent Stucker, Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Additive Manufacturing, 3D Systems I believe the greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade will be the electrification of transportation. This is due to the fact that vehicle electrification has significant challenges associated with energy generation, grid stability, distributed charging of vehicles, battery technology, and optimization of vehicle components for electrical propulsion rather than internal combustion propulsion. We are already seeing additive manufacturing (AM) playing a role in each of these areas, but I think there is still a larger role for AM to accelerate vehicle production and performance as well as electricity generation, transmission, and storage. In order for AM to make an even larger impact, it will be necessary to make significant advancements in technologies, materials, and processes. I think the ability to use multiple materials within one system to build complex multi-material shapes at higher precision and productivity will be a key enabler. When thinking about energy generation and the grid, the goal is to capture a higher percentage of the incoming energy, whether that\u2019s solar, wind, fossil fuel, hydropower, or nuclear. To achieve more efficient energy capture we need complex metal parts from high-temperature materials. AM facilitates this while also enabling efficiencies through parts consolidation. This will also be useful for key components in the grid such as switches and transformers. All of that power we\u2019ve now generated and distributed needs to be stored in batteries and efficiently used to power the vehicle. I foresee AM playing a critical role in the production of next-generation batteries and electric motors. Current battery designs involve complex layers of multiple materials; as such a multi-material additive manufacturing approach compatible with battery-relevant materials at battery-relevant feature resolutions could upend battery design. Similarly, electric motors could shift from nearly monolithic designs to integrating coils built into structural elements or other components. This can result in better thermal management as well as reduced weight, which in turn can help improve efficiency and performance. Being able to process several materials within the same 3D printer takes parts consolidation and efficiency to a whole new level for batteries and electric motors. In addition, the standard benefits of AM to other industries, including the ability to bring new products to market more quickly with less assembly and manual labor, can help accelerate electric vehicle transformations as demand increases. Guy Menchick, Chief Technology Officer, Stratasys As manufacturers worldwide continue to feel the pressure of increased costs throughout the supply chain, the greatest challenge to overcome, almost universally, is being able to drive down costs to remain competitive. For 3D printing specifically, the same is true: it is critical to continue driving down the cost per part, so that we can continue displacing traditional manufacturing with additive manufacturing in more applications. At the same time, we must maintain and improve essential properties that are critical for performance, such as accuracy, surface finish, and mechanical properties. This is predominantly dependent on two key factors: systems and materials. In order to drive down system costs, we need to interrupt the tight correlation among inkjet and DLP technologies between resolution, throughput and price. Increasing resolution means smaller drops. Small drops slow throughput. To compensate, more print heads are often added, which increases price. Fortunately, these 3D printing technologies have been following \u2018Moore\u2019s Law\u2019, which essentially means that system speeds and capabilities will roughly double every couple of years without any increase to the original prices. In a nutshell, this means that many of the Stratasys solutions currently enabling industrial parts production \u2013 from P3 to SAF and more \u2013 will all be set to enjoy a significant performance gain in coming years, without this necessarily being reflected in the base cost.

Nikolai Zaepernick, Chief Business Officer & Managing Director, EOS A big challenge lies on the cost side. Making the most of additive manufacturing for large-scale production and the sustainability possibilities requires to be mindful of bottom-line concerns. The challenge is to reduce cost-per-part along the entire value chain whilst keeping quality promises. For a start there is huge potential to reduce cost-per-part and open new applications by reducing supports in metal 3D printing. By shifting to support-free, we are improving the AM process economically, environmentally and with regard to time. (Not needing to construct supports during the build means less of the material in the powder bed will be melted, it increases the build rate and the support removal costs.) In the future, new support free software tools will help create even better parameters and exposure strategies to further optimize the production process. This will include shorter exposure time, less material consumption and saving post-processing resources. Frank Carsten Herzog, Founder and Managing Director, HZG Group The biggest engineering challenge will be to transfer the processes of 3D printing to industrial production. This involves achieving a high level of reliability, customizability, reproducibility, and speed in AM production, while reducing costs so that it can be used for high-volume manufacturing of parts and products. An enormous task! When it comes to 3D printers, we will see more machines that successfully combine the advantages of established systems that have so far operated in separate solutions. Precision vs. speed, robustness vs. openness to materials \u2013 these points will no longer be mutually exclusive, making technology attractive to a broader range of customers. There is also a high potential for software. The high manual design effort will be reduced by intelligent software, for example. Users will benefit, as will production, as machines can be controlled more efficiently. Dr. Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President Applied Technology, EOS North America One of the largest engineering challenges we will face as an industry in the coming decade will be the complexity of energy, specifically green energy production and energy storage. Wind, solar, fusion, and fission all have the manufacturing challenges that require additive manufacturing due to their unique and intricately designed components. Further, decreasing energy consumption through distributed manufacturing can aid new energy production by requiring less energy globally. Environmental impact will also be a challenge as we continue forging new solutions, leveraging the beneficial derivative nature of AM to lessen customer organization\u2019s footprint on our environment.

Andre Wegner, CEO, Authentise The greatest engineering challenge is to shorten the time it takes to turn an idea into a part. All other manufacturing and engineering challenges come second to this, as shortening this cycle will allow us to develop better, more sustainable products, adapted to local realities. Three technologies are critical to making this happen: First, we need to develop a semantic that will allow us to communicate ideas in words, not geometries. Geometrical designs, even annotated ones, are black boxes that clearly communicate only a fraction of the ideas used to generate them. Customer drivers, machine\/material restrictions, and engineering experience are all lost. A new semantic that allows us to communicate in words would allow algorithms to determine new options for manufacturing when any input changes \u2013 as described below. Secondly, we need to deliver generalized algorithmic tools that allow us to take the semantic input and define production processes, parameters and designs. These tools are already in development, but are scarcely used beyond topology optimization. This has to change \u2013 the speed and volume of data now available to make production decisions from historical, production or in-use sources exceeds human capability and imagination. Thirdly, we need machines fully capable of expressing their capabilities. Not only as designed, but based on the usage profile and environment. Algorithms must be able to query: Given your usage profile, what tolerance are you able to maintain?, alongside many other queries. Wayne Davey, Global Head Go-to-Market, HP Personalization and 3D Printing One of the most obvious challenges we will face in not just the years, but the months to come, is that of climate change. As we move into the new year, sustainability will continue to remain top of the agenda for brands and businesses alike, which will move away from being just a trend, to a requirement. Therefore, as organisations accelerate their sustainability initiatives, manufacturers, brands and other organisations must be looking at their business and workflow processes holistically, to ensure that they\u2019re delivering end-to-end solutions with a lower environmental impact. That includes everything from the materials they offer and where they source it from and how they recycle or reuse those materials, right through to the manufacturing technology they use and how they deal with waste. 3D printing is a viable option to help companies transform into more sustainable businesses. According to HP\u2019s Digital Manufacturing Trends Report, around 50% of global digital manufacturing and 3D decision makers are interested in exploring the technology further for its impact in promoting a circular economy, and therefore reducing the number of materials used in production and simplifying and creating additional value from production systems. Additive manufacturing is proving its ability to do so in the packaging industry. It provides an option to help businesses make smarter decisions whilst also utilising more sustainable solutions. Molded fiber is widely recognised as an eco-friendly and biodegradable alternative to traditional plastic packaging, and eliminates the need for harmful material disposal methods. 3D printing technology will need to continue to evolve, opening up opportunities for use in increased industries and for a wider range of products. With the trajectory of the 3D printing industry so far, it seems likely that technology will continue to innovate and upgrade allowing for more exciting use cases to emerge. A fleet of industrial 3D printers on the production floor \u2013 HP Jet Fusion 5200. Image via HP. Dr. Johannes Homa, CEO, Lithoz Over the coming decade there will be a clear \u201crace for efficiency\u201d to overcome the biggest obstacle currently faced by mankind \u2013 climate change. Working towards eco-friendly solutions and overcoming such problems will be the major priority of engineering over the next decade. Sourcing renewable energy, enabling new and more sustainable materials and most of all reducing the amount of energy required during production are the top focuses for companies right now \u2013 and the key to it all is higher efficiency. As such, innovators will increasingly consider ceramics as a powerful and sustainable solution which can keep pace with the demands of technological innovation. The integral advantages of ceramics over metals and polymers in terms of durability, biocompatibility and flexibility prove why they are gaining a growing share of the market and will offer a real boost in the race for efficiency. From a technological viewpoint, 3D printing will as a first step redesign existing parts to be more efficient. In a second phase, manufacturers will use this technique to create an entirely new generation of sustainable and powerful components. While this technology will be used to improve parts, it is important to also drive the progress of the technology itself forward. Next generations of 3D printing techniques will be developed and released over the coming decade, allowing for the ever faster realisation of increasingly complex and accurate components.

Bas de Jong, COO, 3YOURMIND As distributed manufacturing models continue to evolve and gain new adoption, one of the biggest engineering challenges will be standardizing production processes for additive manufacturing and qualifying parts to scale. Today, many manufacturers equipped with print-on-demand technology utilize proprietary methods or units of measurement. In a distributed manufacturing model, this practice presents part replication challenges that can vary in quality and performance across production sites or part suppliers. To resolve this, there needs to be a two-pronged approach. First, there needs to be buy-in from major original equipment manufacturers and material manufacturers to collaborate with standardization organizations to create a unified vision for what practices should be standardized and why. In addition, software and machine vendors will play a critical role in executing these production standards across different software tools while protecting intellectual property information. Although the challenge is less on engineers to find solutions, it will create a substantial collaborative effort between manufacturing entities protective of design patents and production recipes and vendors and suppliers that provide services across multiple regions or organizations. Sona Dadhania, 3D Printing Analyst, IDTechEx Shifting energy infrastructure from fossil-fuel based sources to renewable energy sources is critical to the fight against climate change. There are a whole host of technologies required to implement renewable energy, one of which is energy storage, a topic often discussed at IDTechEx. For example, the demand for batteries for stationary energy storage grows as electrical grids need to store excess electricity generated from energy sources like photovoltaics. Additionally, renewable energy generation capacity, across many sources like solar, wind, and nuclear, needs to dramatically increase to successfully reduce dependence on fossil-fuel generated power. An important contributor to facilitating this renewable energy transition is additive manufacturing. Not only can additive manufacturing be used to improve the performance, efficiency, and safety of certain sustainable energy sources like wind turbines, but it can also be used to reduce the costs of the installation of renewable energy sources, thus quickening this transition. Additionally, the traditional benefits of 3D printing such as customization of parts and enabling of localized manufacturing and supply chains will help the renewable energy transition occur globally. Kevin Nicholds, CEO, Equispheres Over the next decade, we need to transform our production systems and energy usage to a sustainable model. This is a big-picture challenge that won\u2019t have a single solution, but additive manufacturing will be a significant enabler of the range of solutions that bring together more efficient and resilient supply chains, more energy-efficient transportation and production fueled by sustainable energy, higher levels of recyclability and less waste generation. By permitting more efficient and complex designs, 3D printing enables solutions like improved battery technology and lighter, stronger vehicles. It also has the potential to be a more sustainable manufacturing option, but to realize that advantage at the scale we need requires broader adoption and significantly improved efficiencies. I think the solution is collaboration. Bring the manufacturing knowledge from folks who have been doing large-scale manufacturing for decades and utilize that knowledge to design AM systems and processes. As AM evolves from primarily a R&D and prototyping technology, we are seeing more teamwork. Both companies and individuals with long histories of manufacturing are looking at the AM paradigm in new ways, and this has led to more innovations. I think we need to continue to push collaboration between the technology experts and the manufacturing experts to accelerate the adoption of AM in a way that will make it more capable of helping to solve big-picture challenges, by being faster, more cost effective, and more sustainable as a manufacturing process. John Kawola, CEO, Boston Micro Fabrication While there are multiple technical barriers, material science and full closed loop process control need to reach a level to ensure 3D printing can meet technical needs and meet the control\/quality requirements manufacturers demand. Most 3D printing materials are approximations of standard engineering grade materials. These approximations need to be more aligned. Process control has been implemented in manufacturing for many years. There needs to be development to more seriously apply this to additive. Krzysztof Wilk, R&D Director, 3DGence Previous years showed us how fragile current supply chains are. Companies will seek material and logistics savings and maintain a high level of security for components supply. To make this possible, companies will adapt their infrastructure by equipping it with AI-enabled intelligent production management systems, maximizing the efficiency of local and distributed machine parks. The spread of modern manufacturing technologies will allow for the reduction of material inventories. Digitization of warehouses and on-demand production supported with AI, and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, all of those tools are going to be crucial in modern manufacturing. An essential role in the development of technology will be played by the energy transition, accelerating the emergence of modern solutions that increase energy independence as well as have a positive impact on reducing climate change. Further, into the coming decade, it will be possible to expect the development of new energy and manufacturing technologies to support the expansion of infrastructure beyond our planet. New production systems, energy storage, automated manufacturing of equipment and spare parts in space or the construction of habitats on other planets using locally available raw materials will allow for an ever-widening expansion of human activities beyond the home planet. Arjen Evertse, General Manager Sales EMEA, Mimaki Europe From Mimaki\u2019s perspective, it is expanding on the materials we can use in our 3D printing, which will take our 3D technology to new heights, greatly expanding the possible applications. Ensuring that, no matter the characteristics of the material, they are able to jet through an inkjet head, without compromising on stability or print quality, will be a significant challenge. Knowing what technology will be needed to solve this is certainly another part of that challenge, requiring significant material research and technological development.

Ted Sorom, CEO & Co-founder, Mantle The greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade is also the biggest looming opportunity; how to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) software to reshape the world of manufacturing. Increasingly, manufacturing equipment is able to gather critical process data, but how to most effectively leverage AI to analyze this data and proactively change manufacturing processes in a way that increases efficiency and productivity, while also reducing costs has yet to be determined. Dr. Cora Leibig, CEO and Founder, Chromatic 3D Materials The greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade will be creating robotics that can accomplish complex tasks with simple instructions \u2014 for example, tools to assist the elderly with household tasks. To achieve this, we\u2019ll need manufacturing technology that can be tailored to meet very specific demands. Gavin Jeffries, Founder and CTO, Fluicell AB In the last decade, 3D printing has transitioned from being a prototyping tool for aiding the design process, to now being an essential manufacturing technology, enabling functional parts to be manufactured in ways impossible using conventional tooling. In the coming decade, I would expect to see a similar transition to occur in the 3D bioprinting space, where we will transition away from simple construct demonstrations of printing biological material, to generating essential living tissue sections for pharmaceutical development as well as for therapeutic use. The focus will likely be on patient-specific human tissues, either allogeneic or autologous, with emphasis on establishing personalised bioprinted solutions. When building patient-specific tissues, 3D bioprinting is only the first step in a complex process. Technologies will need to be established to monitor, quality control, and evaluate the function of one-of-a-kind samples. These will likely need to be non-destructive and ideally non-contact techniques, such as holographic phase microscopes and electrical impedance monitoring, to preserve the integrity and function of the tissues. New delivery technologies will also need to be established to utilise the therapeutic benefits while protecting the tissues from immune responses. National networks and regulatory bodies are now beginning to participate in this journey, and responses are now being seen by actions such as the 2022 FDA modernisation act and the upswing of entities such as ATMP (Advanced Therapeutic Medical products) networks and 3R (Reduce, Replace, Refine) implementation, both focussing on transitioning toward using designed tissues instead of animals or simple biological systems. Luo Xiao-fan, CEO, Polymaker For most additive manufacturing technologies, I think process complexity is still the biggest technical challenge. Unlike most traditional manufacturing technologies, 3D printing has many process variables, and there is a highly coupled relationship between process, material and geometric structure; the traditional process development and optimization paradigm can no longer adapt to the highly complex process characteristics of 3D printing. This has also led to a series of challenges that the 3D printing industry is still facing: process development and optimization take a long time, printing process control is difficult, quality consistency is low, performance is unpredictable, and so on. To solve this problem, this requires the coordination of many technologies. First of all, we need to improve the construction of the physical model of the printing process. Academia has done a lot of work in the past few years, and it should be said that a good foundation has been laid. What is needed next is to develop simulation software based on these accurate and verified physical models as the main tool for studying the 3D printing process, and at the same time establish a matching, standardized database of equipment, materials and processes. With this foundation, the application of process development, optimization and control can be built based on specific technologies and application requirements; the technical possibilities here are relatively rich, and it can be combined with artificial intelligence and data science to achieve efficient process optimization , It can also be combined with online monitoring of hardware to realize closed-loop control of the printing process, and can also be connected with design software to form a complete closed-loop from design to production. The realization of the above technologies requires a lot of investment and multi-disciplinary efforts, but this is also the technical threshold that must be solved for additive manufacturing to further realize its potential and truly become a mainstream manufacturing technology. We (Polymaker) have also made a lot of investment and made a lot of progress with many partners in the past few years. In 2023, we will have more profound solutions to face to the market, and here you can also look forward to it. Hardik Kabaria, Vice President of Software, Carbon There are certain pain points in the design and manufacturing space that will need to be addressed through integrated engineering solutions over the next few years. For example, as engineers design products, there\u2019s a significant amount of manual labor that can be repetitive during the design process for mechanical and electrical components while utilizing CAD and CAE software packages. Just in the last couple of years, there have been significant advancements toward automating design processes to counteract this, with tools like physics-informed neural networks being applied to problems in the CAD and CAE world. Engineers are also challenged by fragmented processes. Prototyping processes used in the design stage are not connected to the actual manufacturing process, particularly around development timelines and estimated cost per part. This disconnect can lead to friction, limitations on innovation, and delayed time to market. However, there are advancements being made in the additive manufacturing industry that provide more alignment between the prototyping and manufacturing processes, and I anticipate that this will become more streamlined over the next few years. For example, Carbon has created a software solution, Design Engine, that unifies the product design, development, and manufacturing process to help designers and engineers move seamlessly from idea to design and final production. Similarly, engineers currently need to deal with feedback loops between metrology of the manufactured parts and the intended design that aren\u2019t automated or mature. Our industry as a whole is reinventing the design process for the manufacturers of physical components for products \u2013 from printed circuit boards and chips to large mechanical parts like turbine blades and wings for aircraft \u2013 so these feedback loops will get better but it will take time. Over time, as the systems and processes develop and mature, product development cycles will become more efficient, advanced, and streamlined, which will help companies create better products and bring them to market faster.

Shon Anderson, CEO, B9Creations As environment, social, and governance (ESG) factors continue to become a growing concern for businesses, sustainability will pose the greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade. While additive is widely acknowledged as contributing to reducing the manufacturing sector\u2019s impact on the environment, from reduction of waste vs. subtractive manufacturing to reducing carbon footprint and part travel by printing on-site, we will start to see a shift toward companies needing to address their ESG impact \u2013 from 3D printed parts through post-processing waste streams. Eric Bert, SVP Commercial, InkBit Focusing on our own industry, dimensional accuracy, material properties, and cost-per-part are still challenges to be resolved. AM has to be able to compete with traditional manufacturing methods and win on those factors, and I believe high throughput inkjet is the answer in most cases. It is a priority for Inkbit to drive the cost-per-part down and to be competitive with traditional technologies, as well as other AM processes, whilst delivering the dimensional accuracy and overall structural quality people come to AM for. Material properties are also a crucial factor, again designers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between material and form, as they can\u2019t have both because AM doesn\u2019t offer the material but traditional doesn\u2019t allow for complex geometries, AM is supposed to offer true freedom of design, but in truth we\u2019re still working towards that, often because material choice is still limited. And of course this is what we\u2019re working on at Inkbit, our materials are formulated for durability, to be impact-resistant and withstand long-term UV exposure, and we\u2019re developing more all the time; we use closed-loop feedback control to guarantee repeatable dimensional accuracy and the productivity of our system helps us to deliver very competitive cost-per-part. Inkbit\u2019s 3D printer can produce multi material objects at high volumes. Clip via Inkbit. Alessio Lorusso, CEO & Founder, Roboze Our experience in the additive manufacturing of parts with high-performance thermoplastic materials has demonstrated in recent years its ability to integrate into traditional production processes, offering as the first tangible advantage in the short term the reduction of production costs and delivery times. The next 10 years will be key in increasing end-user awareness of the benefits of industrial additive manufacturing. This will lead to new challenges that we think will be played out on two distinct levels: sustainability and the integration of technology into all stages of production. Roboze is already working on both fronts, proposing not only innovative technologies and materials, favored by our strong nature in the research and development of completely new and competitive ecosystems, but also more sustainable business and financial models. Edward Feng, Founder & CEO, Raise3D Regarding development in the last thirty years, what are the challenges for the 3D printing market for the next decade? I would like to summarize using the TOE framework: T for Technology, O for Organizational structure, and E for Environment. The biggest challenges in the next ten years probably exist within these three aspects. In terms of technology, it refers to the compatibility between old and new technical routes, such as possible iterations of technology and whether automation can support it, how to combine this with traditional CNC, or partially replace traditional manufacturing methods. At an organizational level, a team and its paradigm need to be in line with the pace at which things are developed to absorb new technology, such as 3D printing. It is important for an organization to measure whether they can afford to have a certain tolerance for innovation failure, whether the profit from re-innovation meets the expectation, or if the cost reduction is worth the efforts of adopting 3D printing technology. Additionally, in terms of the environment, the organization needs to be aware that government policy and industrial competition can affect an enterprise\u2019s priority for 3D printing when the intention is to empower a current business. In the real world, TOE readiness is different in Europe, the United States, and in Asia when faced with new technology. The differences exist even between fields, industries, and companies. Therefore, I think that TOE diversity will be the top problem to be solved in order to implement 3D printing in the next ten years. Jason Fullmer, Chief Operating Officer, Formlabs The greatest engineering challenges in the coming decade are supporting the increasing demand for mass customization and designing supply chains for new technologies that are faster, more nimble, and equally as cost-effective as today\u2019s systems. 3D printing supports both of these challenges, enabling efficient, cost-effective onshore production and providing the ability to customize consumer guides at scale without increasing material or labor costs. For example, Formlabs Automation Ecosystem provides a three-time increase in productivity while saving up to 80% on labor, lowering cost per part by 40%, and reducing packaging waste up to 96%. With the ability to manage multi-user, multi-material printer fleets, the Automation Ecosystem enables continuous production so users can send multiple prints to run overnight and into the weekend, making mass production a reality. Philipp Kramer, CTO & Co-founder, DyeMansion Even as devices become more energy efficient, we are facing a huge rise in demand for energy due to population growth and rising incomes, resulting in more money being spent on products and services. We often rely on new technologies to fight climate change, but the improvement of already existing technologies will have a huge impact as well. Planning, manufacturing, and installing sustainable energy sources, such as solar panels or batteries, requires highly skilled people and a lot of effort. Let\u2019s take installing solar panels on the roof of our house as an example. Somebody needs to plan it, parts need to be manufactured, and highly trained technicians need to install it. Automating parts of this process and reducing the need for skilled people (e.g., via AR) will be key to meeting the rising energy demand. DyeMansion\u2019s VaporFuse surfacing system, the Powerfuse S, has received two new process innovations. Photo via DyeMansion. Dr. Vladimir Navrotsky, Additive Manufacturing Chief of Technology, Siemens Energy The greatest engineering challenges of the coming decade are undoubtedly the decarbonization of industries and the energy transition. I strongly believe that additive manufacturing will play a significant role in solving this challenge. Gas turbines that run on biofuels and green hydrogen will still be needed in the future energy mix. AM-designed gas turbine burners allow even installed turbines to be upgraded so they can use of up to 100 percent hydrogen. AM-designed and manufactured high-temperature alloy turbines blades and vanes will significantly increase turbine efficiency and as a result reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Using AM to produce fuel cells and heat exchanges will drastically enhance their efficiency and reliability. Finally, recycling AM components will reduce material demand and emissions. Max Siebert, CEO, Replique I see two major challenges for the engineering industry: persistent supply chain disruptions and climate change. Decentralised manufacturing with a digital inventory can play a critical role in developing greener and more resilient processes by eliminating physical inventory and producing only the quantity needed, anytime, anywhere. 3D printing has already established itself as a serious production method to achieve this goal. However, in the coming years, more training and education in companies and universities will be required to truly scale up. In addition, costs must come down for 3D printing to be used in mass production. In my eyes, pellet printing is an innovative example of how cost reduction can be achieved by streamlining the material manufacturing process to fewer steps. Paul Holt, Founder, Photocentric The biggest challenge in engineering is to develop sustainable solutions for automated mass manufacture. Key to success will be the development of smart software that increases process efficiency in terms of energy, time and materials savings through the use of big data. From a hardware viewpoint, the design of modular systems that are scalable will be the answer to fulfil the needs of parts on demand. Finally, creating recyclable materials suited to the industrial requirements for mass production will complete the ecosystem. Xavier Mart\u00ednez Faneca, CEO, BCN3D One of the biggest challenges facing manufacturing in the coming decade is the need for greater autonomy and control in the production process. This includes the ability to produce products locally, customize them to meet specific needs, and have more control over supply chains. However, currently, 3D printing technologies have not yet reached the level of maturity needed to fully unlock this potential. One solution to this challenge is the development of advanced 3D printing technologies that could become the pivotal point of manufacturing, such as VLM (Viscous Lithography Manufacturing). This technology has the potential to give companies full control over the fabrication life-cycle of their products, from design to final production. Ao Danjun, CEO, Creality The greatest challenge is how to achieve 5-10 times higher printing speed than the current one while balancing print quality and ensuring success rate. In addition, the range of printing materials for high-speed 3D printers, especially industrial-grade 3D printing materials, needs to be expanded. 3D printing is a multidisciplinary technology that involves efforts from multiple sides. We will work with partners in various fields to create a synergy and empower Industry 4.0 by leveraging the power of 3D printing. Doug Kenik, Director, SW Product Management, Markforged As we look at the manufacturing landscape and the evolution of requirements over the past years, we see the industry heading in an exciting direction. Two emerging trends will influence the industry: supply chain disruption and localization to increase efficiency, and the speed of development in a digital world \u2013 which has yet to be matched in the physical world. The collision of these two trends will surface a manufacturing and engineering challenge, demanding further manufacturing disruption to increase efficiencies and bridge the gap between physical and digital in a shorter amount of time. This is a manifestation of on-demand requirements at scale, as well as business drivers to iterate quickly and suppress costly overhead. Overcoming this challenge will require maturing localized manufacturing, such as additive manufacturing, to augment traditional processes, and combine it with digital automation through data and software to increase efficiencies in traditional and emerging manufacturing. Efficiencies through automation will be realized quickly but can only be leveraged with the correct combination of data and software.

Jason Vagnozzi, Global Vice President of Additive Manufacturing, Braskem The promotion of green engineering to reduce the carbon footprint of traditional manufacturing is an important trend we are keeping a close eye on. We believe that additive manufacturing can help play a key role in helping companies to develop a more sustainable approach to manufacturing. Steffen Schmidt, CTO, Danish AM Hub Real sustainable manufacturing will be a big challenge. Too many companies greenwash their image with minor changes to their internal energy usage in their own production and are satisfied with only this minor effort. But they seldom address the real challenge: To change the products they produce and how they produce it. The Scope1 and 2 emission reductions are more or less of a one-off \u2013 not bringing a continuous reduction to our global CO2 emissions. The only way to change this is by knowledge, so both the customer and the manufacturer know of and acknowledge the importance of sustainable products and production. Training and dissemination of knowledge are key, and every manufacturer of 3D printers, CAD, and 3D print-related software needs to implement and support this. Professor Moataz Attallah, The Advanced Materials Processing Lab. (AMPLAB), University of Birmingham The Ukrainian-Russian war has identified sustainable energy as the key engineering challenge. 3D printing may play a great role in speeding up the uptake of both renewable and sustainable energy sources. I hope to see 3D printing being used in the construction of nuclear reactors and their components, either by concrete 3D printing or 3D printing of reactor components. A key game changer would be the development of nuclear fusion. 3D printing can be used to produce the components that are meant to handle the extreme conditions in nuclear fusion, particularly the cooled plasma-facing components. Sylvia Monsheimer, Head of Industrial 3D Printing, Evonik Industries AG A major engineering challenge in the next decade will be realizing the first large-scale industrial lighthouse applications. Admittedly, this presupposes various aspects such as faster processes, more application-specific materials, data handling and automation along the entire production chain as well as proven scaling effects. In the end, no single technology will be able to unbind 3D printing at scale \u2013 it is more of an integrated production chain which is the decisive point. At Evonik, we expect a decade of new infinite 3D applications across all industries contributing to our capability to develop the right high-performance materials and expand our production capacities along the market growth to create trust and actively shape the market and thus being always stay one step ahead. Alexandre d\u2019Orsetti, CEO, Sculpteo The greatest challenge of the upcoming decade will be in the design, and availability of 3D models. We\u2019ve seen a vast hardware expansion in the past, but 3D models are still somehow complicated to make. Nevertheless, we are starting to see some automation in the modeling of 3D files, as well as powerful simulation tools that are required to convince the market and provide reliability on parts. Machine manufacturers, material developers, and service providers have a main challenge of constantly improving the technology to meet the repeatability, quality, properties, and cost per part which are requested by customers to unlock new applications and especially bigger series. Gareth Neal, Business Development Manager EMEA & Israel, 3D Printing & Advanced Applications, Xaar In one word \u2013 energy! The development of energy solutions, from solid state batteries to hydrogen fuel cells, and the role that digital manufacturing techniques can play in enabling these technologies and markets will be increasingly important over the next decade. The ability to digitally print any shape, to exacting specifications with appropriate materials will save time and significantly reduce costs in relation to today\u2019s analogue processes. Here new capabilities such as Xaar\u2019s High Viscosity Technology and particle loading capability will enable developments at a usable resolution and speed, driving new Additive Manufacturing applications in this growing sector. Greg Brown, VP of Technology, Velo3D Thermal management\/distortion as systems get more productive and parts get larger and hotter. Some legacy solutions to these problems on smaller systems (eg. utilizing thick build plates to prevent part deformation, adding machining stock to parts, \u201cghost parts\u201d to avoid part overheating) are not keeping up as systems get bigger and faster. Tight integration of part slicing, in-situ metrology, hardware and simulation are going to be needed to continue pushing up system productivity and lowering printed $\/kg while maintaining high quality associated with laser powder bed fusion. Aerospace components 3D printed on a Sapphire system. Image via VELO3D. Dr. Gerald Mitteramskogler, CEO, Incus One of the upcoming challenges for the European industry is to reach energy and climate targets for 2030 with carbon footprint mitigation. 3D printing in general will help to develop the best technological solutions. At Incus, we highly believe that our Lithography-based Metal Manufacturing technology will enable innovation, and there will be an Incus product involved in solving future challenges. Ewan Baldry, Chief Engineer, Czinger Vehicles Scaling the technology is probably the greatest challenge, but one that is being met head-on by Divergent and Czinger. In 2022 alone, we have seen vast improvements in all aspects of the technology from design, printing, postprocessing, and automated assembly \u2013 new materials, new machines, new processes, all developed in-house. What seems clear is that making significant progress requires a holistic approach. At Divergent, we have engineers and technologists addressing everything that contributes to the increasing commercial viability of the technology\u2019s application. Engineers and technologists who are laser-focused on all areas, from materials scientists developing the powders we print, surface treatments we use, and adhesives we bond with, to AM engineers contributing to the design and development of the printers we use and the most efficient use of those printers, software\/CAE\/optimization engineers who are accelerating the design process to allow us to exploit the real power of 3D printing and so produce components and assemblies that are optimized in terms of the material and energy that is needed to create them. We lucky people at Czinger have all this technology at our fingertips that we are using to create a hypercar that we believe has so many \u201cworld\u2019s firsts,\u201d demonstrating one of our brand pillars, \u201cRevolutionary Technology.\u201d The relationship between Divergent and Czinger (we are all on the same site in Torrance) offers a unique, symbiotic opportunity on many levels. In creating products, Czinger\u2019s demands\/ desires help to drive the technology that Divergent is creating \u2013 Czinger engineers push the Divergent team to enable the realization of their ideas. In Czinger, Divergent has an in-house, real-world application to hone and validate their technology and, in turn, offer it to the broader automotive industry \u2013 a trickle-down effect. It is the creation of companies like Divergent and Czinger, focused on figuring it all out and not just bits of it that will enable the technology to scale and become the way all things are made in the future. Vadim Fomichev, Sales Director, Thor3D 3D printing offers huge opportunities for manufacturers and our forecast assumes that not only small businesses, but also heavy industry is interested in mastering 3D printers. On a big scale swift mass production is crucial, and printing speed remains a challenge. To overcome the limits of 3D printing speed, the engineers have to solve probably the biggest dilemma of their life. Sometimes the nozzle has to go slow to allow the substance to cool down, so you can add the next layer, yet mass production demands to follow strict deadlines. The second challenge is self-sufficiency. Think of modern assembly lines, where robotic manipulators do the job? A dozen of these robots need only one operator. Will the engineers be able to make 3D printers automatic and reliable enough, so a big production will need only one or two operators to manage them? Carlos Zwikker, Chief Commercial Officer, AM-Flow The greatest engineering challenge of the coming decade will be that of creating Smart AM Factories. In the past, we have focused on the main message that the key driver to growing the AM market is reducing cost per part. And we believe this is still true now and most likely to continue to be a relevant message in the coming years. Although the market keeps growing, scaling AM output is inhibited by manual labor. The cost of manual labor is an inhibitive factor in scaling AM production output. Workflow automation is a prerequisite to reducing cost per part and is the basis of creating Smart AM Factories. And the reduced cost per part brings us to more applications with a viable business case, and these viable business cases are what drive further growth. The engineering challenge for the next decade will be to move from non-communicating verticals \u2013 MES platform, printer, post-processing workstations, etc. \u2013 to a fully connected end-to-end digital thread throughout an AM production facility. We are just at the beginning of this journey as this journey runs in parallel with the maturity of printing technology and AM manufacturing processes. AM-Flow sees itself as a driving force and the provider of hard- & software workflow automation solutions for the Smart AM Factory of the future, and we proactively seek collaboration with all other companies contributing to the digital chain of events of the Smart AM Factory of tomorrow. We think there will be closer collaboration between all companies addressing the puzzle of automating 3D print factories. For the end customer, building a Smart AM Factory is more than just acquiring more printers, several post-processing units, workflow automation, etc. Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc, Program Manager, Creaform The upcoming decade will undoubtedly be filled with many challenges, one of which appears to be time to market, i.e., the time required to develop and produce new (or newer generation) products. With workforce getting more and more sparce, there will be an increasing pressure on businesses to develop products faster. Any technology helping to speed product development will inevitably help to solve this problem. Of course, 3D scanning being a major asset when it comes to bringing existing objects into digital processes will certainly be a major contributor. Once data has been captured with a 3D scanner, software to process and use the data will also be a critical aspect to consider. Every step of the process will be more and more critical, and no waste of time will be acceptable. Sam O\u2019Leary, CEO, SLM Solutions I\u2019m not sure I can tell you the problem, but I can tell you that whatever it is, we will find a way to solve it through collaboration, innovation, and open architecture. Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc, Program Manager, Creaform The future of 3D printing will be industrial or not, that\u2019s the challenge. This is why at 3DCeram we have made a technological choice, that of the automatable top down. This choice is unquestionable in an industrial context for mass production. We know that in order to produce a lot, you need large build platforms, which are also versatile and on which it is also possible to print big parts! As we know, moving to the industrial stage implies a production rate which requires automation of the process. And this will have to be done with a user-friendly software interface, the different stages of 3D printing will then be controlled in an intelligent way, with AI, launching the run and monitoring the printing, then automated filtration and cleaning systems, to obtain the final part, ready for firing! At Formnext, in November, we presented a semi-automatic line that will enable relevant production rates to be reached with few personnel, for manufacturers who wish to integrate 3D printing into their production workshops. Ma Jin-song, General Manager, UnionTech The major challenge is realizing product performance through production requirements, which means high efficiency, high consistency, and high stability with low cost, in the middle and long run, to realizing distributive manufacturing. Solutions include: 1. Design: Adoption of new design platforms, DfAM, etc. 2. Material breakthrough: 3D printing materials, as the driving force for the development of the 3D printing industry, have always played a pivotal role in the development of the industry. Therefore, 3D printing materials are an important basis for developing 3D printing technology. To a certain extent, the development of materials is one of the main factors which determine whether 3D printing can have a wider application. We expect that in 2023 and the future, the material properties, implementation of gradient materials, and multi-material printing will be further developed. 3. Printing costs will be lowered further lowered to meet the trend for greater volumes in production. 4. Post-processing technology will be further developed: currently the post-processing is complex and costly 5. Digital manufacturing process chain will be further enhanced to incorporate the demand for agile business models shaped by 3D printing. 6. The trend of equipment\u2019s inter-communication, as well as parameter sets, will be required as the process chain gets integrated. Li Tao, Chairman & CEO, Shining 3D The engineering challenge is \u201caccuracy\u201d and \u201cspeed.\u201d It is mainly reflected in the challenge of achieving fast, stable, and consistent manufacturing capabilities. How to achieve product quality consistency and improve the standardization of the manufacturing process is also the value that Shining 3D focuses on when positioning each product and solution to the market. In particular, compared with the process of subtractive manufacturing and mold manufacturing, the 3D printing process has more variables in terms of controlling the quality of printed products. How to monitor and trace the quality of the whole process will be a system engineering challenge, which involves the comprehensive application of engineering technologies such as various sensors, 3D measurement of internal structure and appearance, plus the analysis ability provided by software algorithms and AI. The natural beauty of 3D printing lies in manufacturing more complex organic structures. With the increasingly stringent requirements on the quality control of printed parts, this also poses higher challenges to the two-dimensional imager and three-coordinate dimension measurement technology. Therefore, Shining 3D high-precision 3D scanning and inspection solutions are also being used more and more in the full-scale measurement of additively manufactured parts. To meet the fast-lane development of the value chain, it is believed that the systematic integration of various engineering technologies related to quality control is critically important. Gui Pei-yan, CEO, HeyGears The development and application of a digital chain is a significant challenge that must be faced in the development of additive manufacturing because data is the key element throughout intelligent production. To deal with challenges, two issues are closely related. On the one hand, the digital chain requires the effective connection of 3D printing hardware with software to form an integrated and digital solution based on actual application requirements. Therefore, professional technologies such as digital material, artificial intelligence, software, and big data processing are worthy of attention and investment. On the other hand, consideration should be given to the consumer\u2019s mindset. In the medium and long term, the increase in consumer consumption patterns and changes in consumption habits will create a higher level of demand for 3D printing applications. This will enhance the development and growth of high-tech 3D printing commodities and high-quality service providers. The popularization path of technology can be traced, with the landing and promotion of digital applications in more fields, 3D printing will play a bigger role in our life, bringing more convenience and benefits. It is necessary to deal with the challenges through investment in technology research and development, to attract, reserve, and continuously invest in talents. Technological development can bring beautiful changes to people\u2019s lives. The key point is to always start from application requirements, combine industrial capabilities with underlying 3D printing digital technology, and intelligently integrate production processes such as data collection, data management, model design, 3D printing equipment, 3D printing materials, and post-processing. The popularization of lowering the barrier of applied 3D printing technology compared with the research and development efforts aimed at the high-end intelligent manufacturing market will co-exist. With the continuous development of 3D printing products for new applications, I believe that the 3D printing industry will bring more benefits to people in the future. Jin Tian-shi, Managing Director, Voxeljet China The next ten years will be a decade that additive manufacturing technology, and customer needs, will interact and shape each other. The value logic of 3D printing is model-free and high-performance. In this decade, we will see 3D printing and traditional manufacturing get work together with each other. The main challenge for 3D printing for mass production applications is to reduce the overall cost, to improve the stability of the equipment, and to ensure the consistency of the quality of printed products. To solve these problems, we must focus on the continuous comprehensive improvement of equipment, materials, processes, and automation. Taking sand mold printing as an example, we will see the emerge of mass production projects of complex sand cores with an annual output of 10,000 pieces and super large sand molds with a single piece of 10 meters big and a single weight of more than 100 tons. In order to meet the above requirements, technologies such as sand material recycling, robots, automatic detection, automatic logistics, and new post-processing techniques will emerge and be gradually promoted and applied. Roger Uceda, Technology Transfer Director, CIM UPC The biggest challenge for the next 10 years will not be to produce a part using 3D printing that meets the requirements for which it has been designed, but to manufacture thousands or millions of parts, with complete confidence that all of them will meet these requirements. For this reason it is necessary to work on two aspects, the first is standardization, essential to give legal coverage to those products that we manufacture. And the second, more important, is to be sure that the parts we produce actually have the right mechanical, thermal, optical\u2026 properties. In the case of 3D printing, knowledge in manufacturing processes and materials will not be enough. The particularities of this technology will require full traceability of the material used, as well as each and every parameter with which it has been manufactured. In CIM UPC we work not only to develop new 3D printing technologies, but in all that involves modeling parts that are being manufactured, with real-time monitoring systems that allow full traceability on the process, being able to guarantee that 100% of the parts that are manufactured are within specifications. James DeMuth, CEO, Seurat Technologies Generating massive amounts of clean energy is going to be one of our greatest challenges for many decades to come. Followed close behind by access to material resources. There are of course many technologies that will take part in solving this, initially focused on intermittent renewables such as solar, wind, and tidal, evolving to steady load generating sources such as geothermal, hydro, and ultimately nuclear fusion. The race is still on to determine which solutions to fusion (and geothermal) will be the most effective, but the world will benefit from competition and a diverse solution set. If history has taught us anything, it is that we often find our greatest discoveries not in what we are seeking, but what we find along the way. The technologies that result from the pursuit of fusion (next-gen lasers, next-gen high power magnetics) will have untold applications that unlock new potentials and capabilities. Our company, Seurat, was born out of the pursuit of fusion, leveraging the lasers for fusion, but applied to material processing to achieve high throughput, high quality, and economical part production competing with conventional manufacturing. Joan Horvath and Rich Cameron, co-founders, Nonscriptum LLC Assuming we are focusing on just engineering challenges in the 3D printing universe, the first few decades of 3D printer development were focused largely on hardware development and experimentation. The last five years or so have mostly been driven by new materials innovation. The next frontier is reliability and ease of use, and we expect software to automate some of the know-how of expert users will be the next big set of improvements. Advances in AI and in machine vision may make key contributions to automated slicing, printing, and part validation in the next decade. David J Webb, 50th Anniversary Professor of Photonics, Aston University Aging workforce is a problem in engineering many Engineers are in 40-60 years age group, with no experience of additive even 30+ have little this means more education is needed to show the benefits of additive as an engineering solution so the promotion of additional courses for people already in the workplace such as CPD will be seen as essential moving forward. Education needs to be on both software and technology advancement and needs to be considered as a mainstream manufacturing technology not hobbyist or for research based This applies also to the medical community where 3D software like \u201cMimix\u201d is being used to view CT and MRI scans to help in surgery. Additive can help take this further by using techniques for slicing and printing to produce 3D models of patients\u2019 bones, organs and veins, again to help in diagnosis and surgery Ryohei Yuasa, Researcher, Head of material design Digital Manufacturing and Design Research Center for Emergent Circularity, Keio University We will see an acceleration of attempts to link materials, products, and social systems, such as the Digital Product Passport. More and more products will be made with detailed information on materials and design to reduce the burden of recycling and disposal. Companies will be asked whether they are able to disclose information on the grade name level of the materials they use. Aur\u00e9lien Fussel, 3D Printing Program Manager + Additive Manufacturing Senior Expert Services Operations, Alstom The three main challenges are: training, training and\u2026 training. I do my best to support the change of mindset regarding design rules for 3D printing (DfAM) by organising elearning, webinars and classrooms. From a simulation software point of view, Finite Element parameters are more and more mature even if final validation on the test bench is still mandatory for critical 3D-printed parts. The fastest change occurs when people are touching 3Dprinted parts and asking how they can use this technology daily. Taso Arima, CEO and Co-Founder, IperionX The next decade will not only bring significant challenges to the field of engineering but also to supply chain management, This includes resource scarcity and efficiency. With a finite supply of raw materials, recycling and reusing materials is a crucial strategy for meeting the growing demand of consumers. The implementation of circular technologies is an essential solution for preserving natural resources and ensuring sustainable production. Take your smartphone as an example, the average device uses an array of critical minerals including copper, tellurium, lithium, cobalt, manganese, tungsten, and more. As demand for smartphones and other consumer electronics grows, so does the strain on the supply of these critical minerals. The UN reports that only 20% of e-waste is recycled annually, leaving the rest to fill and contaminate our landfills. Implementing circular technologies is necessary to reduce our impact on the environment for both the extraction of mineral resources and their post-consumer lifetimes. Frank Roberts, President, 6K Additive Additive manufacturing included, of course, but also with conventional manufacturing, the appetite for more advanced materials will continue to be a focus for many advanced applications. However, the emphasis on ESG will continue to rise as countries and individual companies add more regulations and emphasis on carbon footprint. The intersection of the two issues is where the challenge will grow. A newly developed material may not meet the ESG requirements, and\/or the production method may cause environmental issues. Does the mere fact that its new or that its sustainable drive the price point too high for volume production? Cost and sustainability will all need to converge to bring new materials with a sustainable element to market. Geo-political events, wars, pandemics, and semiconductor chip shortages have all brought supply chain volatility to the forefront of challenges across the globe. A focus not only for the US but for every country is supply chain independence and the ability to recycle material that already exists in many places, including retired military equipment, end-of-life parts, and subtractive technology machine shops, to name a few. The ability to recover precious metals that exist in these components is one challenge, but also the ability to convert the materials back into a usable product at costs that are actually lower than virgin material will present a second challenge. Leapfrog technologies will be key to helping to process critical materials for new applications we haven\u2019t even seen yet. Ian Falconer, Founder, Fishy Filaments Climate change. Direct capture of carbon emissions will be required to bridge the divide between the global haves and have nots, but its no excuse for the haves to ignore technologies and practices that minimise future carbon emissions. We need to link capture with utilisation as an oil replacement. Direct atmospheric and industrial capture of emissions is a waste management issue every bit as much as it is a technological development issue. In recent years we\u2019ve seen public perception change with regards to using the ocean as a general dump for land based waste. There is an analogy with using the atmosphere as a dump for industrial waste gases but the public does not yet make that same connection, perhaps because we don\u2019t see songbirds wrapped in solid bands of CO2 and we can\u2019t organise community-level CO2 picks that empower individuals. There is no positive end of the physical engagement spectrum for carbon emissions, only geographic or population-level negative impacts, and that limits how the communicating professions can direct attention to the issue. So we need to see a set of tech that enables direct capture and re-use of carbon and methane emissions by businesses and organisations, but without the need to mobilise the general public. That means they have to be cheap or preferably profitable. Storage through materialisation and resale, rather than burial, is a means to replace crude oil and natural gas and that might enable profitable carbon capture without excessive taxpayer subsidy. Franco Cevolini, CEO, CRP Technology From my perspective, the challenges that we shall face are a few. Even if some of them are less immediate or less obvious, they can still lead to great benefits and an effective strategy. The first concerns the switch to an efficient production level where all the stages and issues typical of the mass production process have to be properly addressed: from efficient order execution to packaging and production process optimization. We as a group are investing not only in new technological solutions but in a combination of technological upgrade with personnel skills implementation. Now more than ever, achieving excellence requires an understanding of production impact in terms of parts reliability. This is and has always been a focal issue of additive manufacturing, where a variety of factors have to be carefully categorized, controlled, and thoroughly monitored. Quality system in the Additive Manufacturing process still represents a long path where a complete array of activities have to be focused, coordinated and deployed. Among these Process Automation is acquiring huge importance. The additive technology has evolved, and its possible applications are constantly growing with the adoption of new models. Of course this expansion needs to be guided and requires setting new routines to improve the results already achieved. This is a delicate upgrade as automation is commonly connected to large-scale numbers while here, it has to coexist with low volumes and quite a few variables playing an important role. Stephan Beyer, Co-founder & Chief Venture Officer, nFrontier Quality of parts, costs, availability are key and can be solved with the existing technologies\u2026.no need to invent more of them. But two true and remaining challenges remain. Sustainability and digital. Automated design, digital twins, CAM \/ PLM integration are just a few open issues where digital tools still have to be developed. Secondly, AM still has to prove its impact on sustainability, not only green washing. John Olhoft, President, LulzBot Bridging the gap between 3D Design and physical object creation. As it stands right now there are a large number of remarkable innovators and engineers that are either too intimidated by or lack the time to invest in 3D Design. I believe that more intuitive software, coupled with the quick wins available with 3D Printing, will help to make 3D Design less of a hurdle during the next decade. John E. Barnes, Managing Director, and Laura Ely, Director of Programs, The Barnes Global Advisors The greatest engineering challenge is here: Creating the right team. How do we create technical teams with the right skills to solve complex problems of the decade? How do we inform management whose job it is to sustain the business with increasingly complex technical evolutions? The future is the team. The future is knowledge. And the future is technology. But technology without knowledge to absorb, understand and utilize is pointless. The future is a team sport because the future is complex. We need more brains, and we need more openness to tap into the brain potential regardless of sex, race, religion, or anything else. We just need brains that are interested in solving these problems. Steven Camilleri, CTO and Co-Founder, SPEE3D One of the key issues is the development of new technology that solves problems more sustainably than before with better efficiency and less waste and excess. This should be a key goal, especially for the 3D printing industry. For example, 3D printing should not be limited to just creating new parts; it should also be used more and more for repairing, restoring and modifying parts. Solving problems by making parts close to the point of need eliminates the transport energy and emissions that would otherwise be needed to move the parts around. Metal 3D printing, (particularly our cold spray process,) is one of the most efficient ways to do this since it produces parts responsibly, quickly and inexpensively. Technologies need to be developed that allow the simple and convenient manufacture of new parts using material recovered from old parts \u2013 this is really only possible at the moment with metal materials. All of the trends point to a continued increase in attention toward 3D printing as a tool for making parts and solving problems more sustainably. Joshua M. Pearce, Ph.D., John M. Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation, Western University The greatest challenge we have is to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels, their pollution and thus climate destabilization. We can do this with a combination of solar photovoltaics, which already produce the least expensive electricity on the planet and offset coal (coal air pollution already kills 52,000 Americans every year ). Electrification of heating (solar-powered heat pumps are already economic in the northern US and Canada ) and can replace much of our natural gas use. Finally, electrification of transportation can be accomplished with electric vehicles, which are also already economic. Interestingly, in all of these, cases we are manufacturing constrained for photovoltaics, heat pumps and EVs (particularly batteries). We have also witnessed 3D printing reducing manufacturing time, fabricating superior products, and saving costs. There is already some evidence of this in these fields (e.g. 3D printing low-cost solar racking). In the future, I think we can expect to see 3D printed PV, heat exchangers in heat pumps, and electric batteries to help us kick the fossil fuel addiction. Dr. Ingo Ederer, CEO, voxeljet Well, this is a tough question. From my point of view, humans need to get away from fossil and move to renewable energy sources in big scale. Wind and solar energy must be available at low cost and, last but not least, we need suitable storage technologies. Manufacturing technologies play a major role in solving these issues, as they are associated with product costs but also product efficiency. In this respect, 3DP will also play a key role in mastering these tasks. Alan \u201cPooch\u201d Puccinelli, Founder, Repkord LLC We\u2019re working with antiquated manufacturing paradigms and oftentimes relying on suppliers overseas to produce the parts we need economically. Political factors as well as energy and shipping cost increases are making this less and less attractive as time goes on. Rather than relying on massive manufacturing hubs we need to develop smaller systems of distributed manufacturing that allow us to minimize transportation costs and move more towards on demand fabrication that can pivot readily based on regional demand. The issue in my mind isn\u2019t one of technology but logistics and business savvy. Communities need to be better empowered to produce their own goods both as a means of independence and supporting their local economies. Thomas Batigne, CEO, Lynxter Flexible functional A.M. x10 times faster for the same quality and cost. Data driven manufacturing software, embedded monitoring, and CAD\/CAM, effectors optimisation & smart suggestion for the user should allow this. It requires a massive commitment from all kinds of engineering & PhDs. to achieve it, and a significant time to have it adopted. That\u2019ll keep us busy! Dr. Wilderich Heising, Partner and Associate Director, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Looking at the high level of quality in the parts that we could witness at Rapid and Formnext in 2022 it makes me very confident, that AM is here to stay. Quality has reached very decent levels that allow us to move from prototyping into manufacturing and end-use parts production. This transition will be a major unlock for the growth in AM in the years to come across many industries. However, mastering the transition from prototyping to manufacturing will also be one of the key challenges to overcome for the 3D printing industry. I believe that we will not see a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d technology that caters for the manifold needs of the various current and future applications in 3D printing. That means that we will need to see further advancements on the various technologies out there to be fully fit for purpose for specific applications. But we should not look at a technology alone, we need to consider the interplay between material, technology and software and must optimize this ecosystem as a whole to offer solutions for specific customer needs and not just a tech offering. This will be a key step in advancing the additive manufacturing industry. Angel Llavero, CEO, Meltio From our point of view, we are convinced that in the coming years we will see increasing demand from various industries for installing hybrid 3D printing systems in their local production centers. We are calling that process Hybridizing metal 3D printing solutions for the industrial sector. At Meltio, we saw this need a few years ago, and that is why we patented our wire laser metal 3D printing technology, whose head can be integrated into a CNC machine or a robotic arm. Industries in mining, oil, and gas, defense, automotive, aerospace, and engineering education centers, among others, are no longer looking to install dozens of metal 3D printers to manufacture parts, but are interested in installing hybrid manufacturing systems that include the ability to manufacture 3D metal parts in shorter times and with lower costs and high levels of part reliability on their CNC equipment. This is an industrial revolution in manufacturing thanks to metal 3D printing that Meltio is and will respond to in the future by innovating with new hardware and software solutions. In the factory floor of the future, I am sure that we will see these hybrid systems installed alongside CNC mills, molding setups, drill presses, lathes, and other familiar setups in the traditional and subtractive manufacturing world. The interplay continues with 3D-printed molds and other parts for conventional equipment. This is a new paradigm for metal AM: the factory floor of the future look like for efficient manufacturing and to produce metal printed parts locally. Dr.-Ing. Vincent Morrison, CEO, AIM3D GmbH With the broad usage of AM in series production we will have to solve the situation that the scrap rate of the AM process is still quite high compared to other well-known production processes. Even when you consider the fact that material extrusion and powder bed fusion processes can reach high recycling rates, the recycling of scrap parts will not solve this situation, as machine time and energy are still lost, even if the material could be reused. To overcome this, the challenge for all AM processes is to stabilize their scrap rate well below 2%, even under high throughputs. The main problem \u2013 and therefore the problem to solve for the AM world \u2013 are the high number of parameters to be monitored while printing, especially if you take the long build time of the parts into account. Typical approaches like in-process part inspection with laser sensors are far too slow and will destroy the economical parameters of the printers. Based on this, we need to change our view on the process control by using high-performance PLCs and new sensor approaches with their respective possibilities. Maybe we will also need to implement complex neural AI process controls into the machines to cope with the high amount of data and process state spaces. Ramsey Stevens, CEO, nano3Dprint In the next ten years, the most significant engineering challenge for 3D-printed electronics will be creating efficient, economical, and scalable methods of fabricating high-performance electronics. Additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the way electronic devices are made; it empowers users to mass produce flexible electronic devices and structures on a wide array of substrates. However, technical challenges need to be overcome for this to happen, like developing new classes of 3D printable inks and materials with higher resolution, higher performance, and stability. To create advanced multi-material electronic devices accurately and rapidly, we must develop new 3D printing techniques that allow for the simultaneous printing of multiple materials and integration of different functionalities. This will require advancements in software and control algorithms to achieve quick, efficient production of high-quality printed electronics. It will also require developing precise, fast, and energy-efficient hardware. To automate the design, optimization, and process control that enables faster prints, we\u2019ll need new machine learning solutions. To ensure that printed parts adhere to the specifications and standards, updated quality assurance methods will also need to be created and enforced. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary to solve these challenges \u2013 it will involve working collaboratively with materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering experts. Bradley Rothenberg, CEO, nTopology The greatest engineering challenge of this decade is reversing climate change. There isn\u2019t just one magic technology that\u2019s required to solve this, rather, it will take a collective effort across industry requiring new processes of design. 3D printing and advanced engineering will help in opening up design space to deliver products that we could only once dream about. For example, some of our customers are working on nuclear fusion, sustainable agriculture and reducing our carbon footprint. One thing I know for sure is that legacy ways of design will not lead to the innovations required to tackle climate change. We now have an entire new generation of engineers trained in an AM-first way of thinking. I am excited about their potential to really help us solve this major human problem. Jarek Pieniazek, New Offer Development Manager, Sinterit The growing political conflicts of economic powers will slow down the trend of global production. Thus, domestic production will increase. The biggest challenges will be the use of limited resources and problems with energy costs and production. There is no single technology, but leveraging more local sources will certainly be critical. It is is a place for 3D printing and low-volume production. The ever-improving accuracy and repeatability of printouts will be a challenge, but the price per print will be a key. Ren\u00e9 Kreissl, Head of Business Unit Additive Manufacturing, TRUMPF With our focus on industrializing Metal AM technologies, one of the greatest challenges that we will face, is increasing the productivity of our systems while maintaining high part quality. This is extremely important to enlarge the AM use-cases and increasing the suitability of AM for large volume serial production, for example for the automotive industry. Great engineering challenges, will always require great engineered solutions and unlocking technological worlds for generations to come, is what we do at TRUMPF. For our TruPrint PBF systems, we already integrating several new technology approaches that will boost productivity and part quality many folds. One of such innovations is the hybrid manufacturing or \u2018Preform\u2019 option that we launched for the TruPrint 5000 at Formnext 2022. We consider it as an important milestone in the industrialization of additive technologies to combine technologies whenever it makes sense. Furthermore, another feature is an automation feature for our smallest machine, the TruPrint 1000, wherein up to four substrate plates can be automatically produced without the need for stopping the PBF process. Stay curious \u2013 we will see some massive technological leaps this decade and we are happy to be on the front seat. Read more: Who is leading the 3D Printing Industry?

Pure Harvest will design, construct and operate high-tech, climate-controlled hybrid food production systems that allow year-round production of high-quality, safe, and sustainably-grown fresh fruits & vegetables, free of pesticides, offering Saudi consumers a constant availability of high-quality fresh produce that was never before possible due to the Kingdom's challenging arid climate. Nadec will utilize its existing infrastructure, far-reaching distribution network, and trusted consumer brands to deliver its partner's fresh produce to the market. This strategic alliance is closely aligned with the Kingdom's Vision for a more self-sufficient and sustainable food system. The parties completed and commissioned their first-ever project on December 29, 2021, producing over fifteen (15) varieties of high-quality, hydroponically-grown tomatoes in an approximately 6-hectare high-tech, climate-controlled growing system in Nadec City, Haradh, KSA. This sustainable tomato production facility is fully integrated into Nadec's existing infrastructure, including its innovative 30-MW captive solar farm. The groundbreaking project produces over 5 million kilograms of locally grown tomatoes per annum, harvesting daily throughout the full year, with peak production occurring during the harsh summer months, during which local production has historically been impossible, thus contributing directly to the Kingdom's food sovereignty. This innovative project is the first of many that the partners expect to develop together, integrating the full value chain of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) production. Pure Harvest seeks to deploy substantial production capacity over the next five (5) years in KSA, farming a wide range of crops, and Nadec will market these products to its expansive consumer base, hotels, restaurants, and catering partners. The partners share a vision to assist in the transition towards greater food security, water conservation, economic diversification, and sustainability in the Kingdom, as well as the broader GCC region. By originating large-scale, renewable energy-integrated food production infrastructure in KSA, Nadec and Pure Harvest are together making possible local-for-local high-quality, pesticide-residue free, clean, and healthy fresh fruits and vegetables production that, thanks to Pure Harvest's pioneering production technology, are \"always in season\" \u2013 proudly serving the Kingdom's citizens. Dr. Solaiman A. AlTwaijri, CEO of Nadec, stated: \"We are delighted to be partnering with Pure Harvest Smart Farms and to bring their distinctive controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) solutions and expertise to the Kingdom. Nadec has a long tradition of supplying a broad range of staple food products to both the Kingdom and the surrounding region. Moving into the supply of high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables is a natural extension of our legacy. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing safe, secure, local food supply for our customers, and this partnership is a new opportunity for us to delight those customers while at the same time making a momentous contribution to the country's food security and water conservation objectives. Nadec is proud to promote sustainable agricultural development in the Kingdom, in accordance with the ambitious goals of the Saudi Vision 2030, as well as the clear vision of our government.\" Sky Kurtz, Founder & CEO of Pure Harvest Smart Farms, added: \"We are honored to begin this partnership with Nadec. They are a formidable incumbent food supplier with a sterling reputation and brand, sizeable landholdings and enabling infrastructure, and an experienced leadership team. We greatly benefit from Nadec's strength, and together we are pioneering a new category of fresh produce for the Saudi people \u2013 premium local. High-quality, delicious, safe, and affordable fresh produce that is always in season\u2026 offering new varieties, new products, and a fundamentally novel fresh produce experience. Our purpose at Pure Harvest is to enable positive change through smart, sustainable farming, and Nadec shares this objective. We are grateful to work with Nadec to accelerate the Kingdom's vision towards a more sustainable future.\" Compared to traditional, lower-tech farming methods, Pure Harvest's novel resource-efficient food production systems have many advantages aligned with the Kingdom's Vision 2030 mandate to conserve resources and reduce carbon emissions. Other distinctive features of its systems include the absence of soil and pesticides, as well as leveraging information technologies to make the best possible production decisions while largely automating certain agricultural processes such as irrigation, pest control, and climate management. Pure Harvest's growing systems result in very low water consumption per kilogram of production and are principally powered using Nadec's renewable energy. Further, Pure Harvest can harvest waste heat from existing fossil fuel power plants and nearby infrastructure and use this energy to offset power demands in its climate systems while consuming CO2 (a fundamental ingredient for photosynthesis) to significantly increase its productivity. Due to the use of CO2 dosing, renewable energy integration, and the project's close proximity to the Riyadh metro market \u2013 resulting in transportation-related cost and CO2 emissions savings \u2013 this farm in the Kingdom is among the most innovative and sustainable farming projects in the world. As part of their partnership, Nadec and Pure Harvest will collaborate to support existing local farmers by developing sustainable solutions that they, too can use to improve yields, to reduce water consumption, and to boost production quality.","filter_flag":1}

Cormac McHugh started his own construction company at the age of 20 after becoming an engineer. After running the business for more than 15 years, McHugh pivoted towards the wholesale renewable energy space and later began manufacturing products for the wider renewable energy sector. His most recent project, however, is Dairy Robotics \u2013 a start-up on a mission to modernise the dairy industry using cutting-edge technology and help save the planet at the same time. Based in Athy, Co Kildare, the company designs and manufactures animal health monitoring devices and robotics to automate the process of milking cows. AI and udder technologies With an estimated 300m dairy cows across the world, McHugh is betting on \u2018new generation\u2019 dairy farmers wanting to invest in technologies for their farm as fewer and fewer people are willing to work in them. The need to feed a growing global population, however, still remains. \u201cWe need to have healthier, higher producing animals. Dairy Robotics\u2019 Animal Health [an app-based tech used for body condition scoring of farm animals] can help achieve this through early detection of any health issues on dairy farms,\u201d McHugh recently told SiliconRepublic.com. \u201cEarly detection of issues promotes milk production, provides better reproductive efficiency and reduces emissions through increased efficiency.\u201d Body condition scoring is a common tool used in farm management to assess the physiology of animals and quantify their fat accumulation in order to determine their health and nutritional status. For McHugh, this process should be simple and straightforward. \u201cOur clever plug and play device can easily be integrated on any farm without any specialist requirements. As cows walk past our RFID [radio-frequency identification] reader, it identifies the animal\u2019s unique ear tag,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis starts recording a video stream on our edge device in both 2D and 3D. After initial processing, the video streams are sent to the cloud for further near real-time processing through our artificial intelligence algorithms.\u201d The animal scores and action recommendations are then reported back to the farmer via an app or the existing farm management system. The app contains a database of the full herd and provides trends and feedback on individual as well as general herd health. \u201cAnother benefit of our system is that we have various databases for the animals which can be country or cow breed specific. We are providing a growing database of courses of action for the farmer when an issue is flagged in the system \u2013 such as feed or protein rations and veterinary intervention required.\u201d High demand Other than animal health monitoring, Dairy Robotics is also looking to improve and scale the labour-intensive task of milking cows using the power of AI. The tech is able to identify individual udders for better cup attachment and even monitor any changes to milk output. According to McHugh, this is an area of high demand. \u201cThe adoption of advances in technology in this space ensures continued growth opportunity. This is illustrated through the large growth on robotic milking machine which is expected to double in a five-year period,\u201d he said. Currently taking part in the AgTechUCD accelerator programme until the end of this month, Dairy Robotics is looking to launch its product in mid-2023. Interest in its tech, however, has already started coming in \u2013 all the way from across the Atlantic. \u201cThere has already been significant interest from numerous market sectors across the world, reaching out to us for more information,\u201d said McHugh, who plans to raise significant investment this year. \u201cThis ranges from individual dairy farmers to potential US distributors and even some national dairy boards looking for additional information.\u201d 10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.
