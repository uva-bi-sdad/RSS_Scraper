Learn more . The demand for unique and personalized clothing items is increasing in the market, and the trend of custom clothing is set to continue at a rapid pace in 2023. As customization allows consumers to express their individuality, it is becoming a key element in the fashion industry. Consumers are also now more conscious of fast fashion\u2019s environmental impact, so they prefer to wear and purchase garments tailored to their specific needs rather than something straight off the rack. Read on to learn more about why you should be harnessing the power of sustainable custom clothing this summer. The Power of Sustainable Custom Clothing Greater a Variety of Clothes A key difference between custom clothing and off-the-rack items is that you have multiple options for fabric, colors, and styles. This way, you can express yourself through your clothing while staying within budget. In addition, you get to minimize your carbon footprint with sustainable materials. Customized clothing doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. For example, you can use digital printing on t-shirts to create new designs. You also get flexibility in the type of fabric you want to wear. With the summer weather, you want to wear cotton, linen, or other materials that will keep you cool. Keep up With the Latest Fashion Trends Whether looking to buy for yourself or starting a clothing store, you naturally want to keep up with the latest fashion trends. Following the latest fashion trends often comes with a hefty price, but not when you choose to get your clothes custom-made. Your wardrobe can remain eco-friendly while still looking good. Custom clothing lets you stay updated on fashion trends without wasting much time and effort finding trendy readymade pieces. Some eco-friendly brands are cashing in on the sustainable clothing trend by charging more; you don\u2019t have to be a victim of such companies. Get the Right Fit Unfortunately, the standard clothing sizes don\u2019t work for everyone. This is another primary reason why an increasing number of people are using custom clothing. Not only do they get to design the clothes, but they also have more options with fitting. They also don\u2019t need to worry about alterations after the clothes, as the clothes are made to fit their size. Comfort and fitting are one of the top priorities when it comes to fashion wear. You can also find it satisfying to know that you are wearing clothes made from eco-friendly practices and materials. Enjoy the Savings With customized clothes, you enjoy savings in many ways. Of course, you won\u2019t have to spend on expensive brands. Also, the best customizable clothes brands offer good quality products so you won\u2019t have to frequently spend on buying new clothes. While fast fashion clothes might save you money upfront as they are cheaper, they won\u2019t provide the durability offered by high-quality clothes. Eco-friendly garments are typically softer and last longer, which means more savings for you in the long run. Sustainable Clothing Trends Sustainable fashion is more than just a passing fad; it\u2019s a growing movement driven by conscious consumers like you. By choosing eco-friendly materials, supporting ethical practices, and opting for timeless pieces, you can positively impact the environment and the fashion industry. Let\u2019s explore the exciting realm of sustainable clothing and discover how fashion-forward choices can contribute to a greener future. Fast fashion\u2019s dirty little secret Did you know that the fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to global pollution? According to research, it generates about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions and consumes vast amounts of water. [irp posts=\u201d41745\u2033 name=\u201d10 Reasons Why We Need to Put an End to Fast Fashion\u201d] However, sustainable clothing aims to disrupt this harmful cycle by offering alternatives that prioritize eco-friendly materials and production methods. From organic cotton and recycled polyester to innovative fabrics made from pineapple leaves or mushroom mycelium, designers are pushing the boundaries of sustainable fashion. But sustainability goes beyond materials. It also encompasses fair labor practices and social responsibility. Many sustainable clothing brands emphasize ethical manufacturing, ensuring safe working conditions and fair wages for garment workers. By supporting these brands, you can positively impact the lives of individuals and communities involved in the fashion supply chain. In addition to the ethical and environmental benefits, sustainable fashion also offers you the opportunity to express your unique style and stand out from the crowd. With a focus on quality over quantity, sustainable clothing tends to be durable and timeless, allowing you to build a versatile wardrobe that transcends fleeting trends. By embracing a more conscious approach to fashion, you can redefine your personal style while reducing waste and minimizing your carbon footprint. Whether you\u2019re looking for chic everyday essentials, stunning red carpet-worthy outfits, or innovative upcycled creations, the world of sustainable clothing has something for everyone. In a nutshell Some of the biggest themes emerging around the fashion industry include: Circular fashion: Circular fashion is a more sustainable approach to fashion design. Circular fashion designs are made to be reused, recycled, or repurposed. This can be done by using modular designs, making clothes that are easy to repair, or using sustainable materials that can be broken down and recycled. [irp posts=\u201d43233\u2033 name=\u201dRise of the Circular Economy: An Exploration of New Business Opportunities\u201d] Transparency: Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in knowing where their clothes come from and how they were made. Sustainable brands are responding to this demand by becoming more transparent about their supply chains and production practices. Ethical manufacturing: Sustainable brands are committed to ethical manufacturing practices, such as fair wages, safe working conditions, and environmental protection. Natural materials: Natural materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, and bamboo, are becoming increasingly popular in sustainable fashion. They are often more sustainable than synthetic materials, as they require less water and energy to produce. Additionally, natural materials are often biodegradable, meaning they will decompose naturally over time. Upcycling and recycling: Upcycling is transforming waste materials into new products, while recycling is converting waste materials into new materials and objects. Both of these practices can help reduce the fashion industry\u2019s environmental impact.","filter_flag":1}

It is a major contributor to the global economy, generating trillions of dollars in revenue each year. Textile industry has a major production and consumption centers in Asia, Europe, and North America. India\u2019s Textile Industry: A Global Powerhouse India\u2019s textile industry is a major contributor to the country\u2019s economy. The industry is experiencing a shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly practices. India\u2019s textile industry has immense potential in the global market. The government has implemented various initiatives to support the growth of the textile industry such as \u201cMake in India\u201d to promote domestic manufacturing and aims to position India as a global manufacturing hub. Special focus is being given to skill development programs, technological upgradation, and infrastructure development to enhance the industry\u2019s competitiveness. India\u2019s textile industry has immense potential in the global market. The country\u2019s rich textile heritage, skilled workforce, and cost competitiveness position it as a key player. With its diverse product range, including traditional handloom fabrics, intricate embroideries, and contemporary fashion apparel, India has the capability to meet the varied demands of global consumers. The industry is on a trajectory of growth, but addressing challenges is crucial for its long-term success. Additionally, steps have been taken to improve logistics and reduce lead times, making Indian textiles more attractive in the global market. Challenges The global textile industry is facing a number of challenges, including weakening demand, inflation, and high energy prices, rising labor costs, increasing competition from low-cost countries (global competition), environmental regulations, infrastructural bottlenecks, outdated machinery, limited access to finance, fluctuating raw material prices and changing consumer preferences. Despite its promising outlook, the Indian textile industry faces challenges that need to be addressed for sustained growth. These challenges have led to a decline in business conditions, order intake, and capacity utilization. Weakening Demand \u2014 Weakening demand is the top concern for the global textile industry. This is due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions. As a result, consumers are spending less money on clothing and other textiles. Inflation \u2014 Inflation is another major challenge for the textile industry. The prices of raw materials, energy, and transportation have all been rising, which has put pressure on margins. In addition, rising inflation is making it more expensive for consumers to buy textiles, which is further suppressing demand. High Energy Prices \u2014 High energy prices are also a major challenge for the textile industry. Textile mills use a lot of energy to operate, and the rising cost of energy is making it more expensive to produce textiles. This is leading to higher prices for consumers and reducing profits for businesses. Order Intake \u2014 The decline in demand has led to a decrease in order intake for the textile industry. In May 2023, the order intake index fell to 70, which is the lowest level since 2017. This decline in order intake is a sign that the industry is facing a tough environment. Capacity Utilization \u2014 The decline in demand has also led to a decrease in capacity utilization rates. In May 2023, the capacity utilization rate fell to 70%, which is the lowest level since 2017. This decline in capacity utilization is a sign that the industry is not operating at full capacity. Rising labor costs \u2014 As wages in developing countries rise, textile manufacturers are facing increasing pressure to keep costs down. Increasing competition from low-cost countries \u2014 Countries like China and India have become major textile exporters, and they are able to produce textiles at a much lower cost than developed countries. Environmental regulations \u2014 Textile production can be a major source of pollution, and governments are increasingly imposing stricter environmental regulations. Infrastructural bottlenecks \u2014 These bottlenecks can include inadequate roads, railways, and ports, as well as poor storage facilities. These can lead to delays in the transportation of raw materials and finished goods, which can increase costs. Outdated machinery \u2014 Outdated machinery can be less efficient and produce lower quality textiles. This can make it difficult for Indian textile manufacturers to compete with foreign manufacturers who have more modern equipment. Limited access to finance \u2014 This can make it difficult for SMEs to invest in new machinery and technology, which can prevent them from becoming more competitive. Additionally, limited access to finance can make it difficult for SMEs to weather economic downturns. Changing consumer preferences \u2014 The textile industry is also facing changing consumer preferences. Consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable and ethical textiles. Opportunities in the textile industry The following opportunities provide a great potential for growth in the textile sector in India. The global apparel market is expected to reach $1.9 trillion in 2025. India offers a complete value chain solution from farm to fashion. The Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks are being established across seven states of the country. PM MITRA Parks will lead to reduction of logistic costs due to cluster-based approach of manufacturing and production of quality products with appropriate testing facilities. India is actively considering the possibility of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with various countries, these agreements will help to boost exports of Indian textiles and open up new markets for the sector. The global apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.3 percent from 2020 to 2025. This growth is being driven by factors such as increasing disposable income, growing urbanization, and rising demand for comfortable and stylish clothing. Global exports of MMF & MMF blended Textiles witnessed around CAGR 5 percent during last 18 years. Amongst the four segments, Made ups recorded highest CAGR 7.4 percent, followed by Yarn 4.4 percent, Fabrics 4.2 percent and MMF 3.2 percent. India is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth as it has a strong textile manufacturing base and a large pool of skilled labor. The country is also home to a number of leading textile brands and retailers. The PM MITRA Parks are expected to create around 1 lakh direct and 2 lakh indirect jobs per park. They will also help to reduce the logistic costs of the textile industry, making Indian textiles more competitive in the global market. Promoting \u201cKASTURI Cotton \u201d as a premium brand by enhancing international perception & valuation of Indian Cotton, Positioning it as a reliable quality product, thereby facilitating premium pricing and thereby enhancing export opportunities. To ensure the availability of high-quality products throughout the value chain, the government has introduced Quality Control Orders (QCO) for polyester products such as Terephthalic Acid (PTA), Ethylene Glycol (MEG), and Polyester Fiber. The objective is to regulate the import of sub-standard goods and promote the manufacturing of superior products within the country. Overall, the textile sector in India has a bright future. The opportunities mentioned provide a great potential for growth in the sector. There are some signs of improvement in the global textile industry. Order cancellations have decreased, and inventory levels are under control. In addition, the industry is expected to recover in the second half of 2023. The textile industry is a large and diverse industry with many opportunities globally. There is growing demand for sustainable textiles, personalized clothing, e-commerce, and new technologies.

The fashion industry has, as a result, undergone a dramatic shift, with high-end brands under more pressure than ever before to ensure that all aspects of bringing a product or line to market \u2013 from sourcing and manufacturing to transportation \u2013 are done so with a more eco-friendly approach in mind, and while some have been slow to adapt, others have embraced the challenge wholeheartedly. In 2023, luxury clothing brands are more ethical than ever \u2013 which is no small feat when you consider that many were steeped in controversy just a decade or two ago for their choices of materials and the processes involved with bringing their products to market. Once at risk of losing valued customers, by adopting sustainable initiatives, these brands are not only reducing their environmental impact but turning things around for themselves and also setting new standards for the industry as a whole. Spurred on by a new breed of luxury brands that have placed sustainability at their heart from the very heart \u2013 like Copenhagen Bamboo, whose bamboo clothing is produced in a way that minimises the use of chemicals, pesticides and artificial irrigation \u2013 the high-end market has well and truly entered a new era \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t come a moment too soon. Here\u2019s how things have changed for the better. Ethical sourcing and production processes Consumers are seeking out sustainable materials like organic cotton and recycled alternatives The practices associated with fast fashion have long been criticised for their damage to the environment, with chemicals being dumped into waterways during the manufacturing process and huge carbon footprints created through all that\u2019s required to bring them to market on such a large and recurring scale. But luxury fashion has always been synonymous with timeless styles and impeccable quality, with garments and accessories built to last \u2013 and in 2023, our favourite high-end clothing brands are going one better on that and placing increasing emphasis on ethical sourcing and responsible production methods. That means seeking out sustainable materials like organic cotton and recycled alternatives, reducing the use of harmful chemicals and minimising water consumption during manufacturing, as well as reducing the overall carbon emissions associated with the process. Transparency, too, has become vital for luxury brands looking to remain in favour, which means being open and honest about all elements of the supply chain. As a result, this has meant better and safer working conditions and fairer labour practices overall, thus representing a commitment to social, as well as environmental, responsibility. A circular economy The concept of a circular economy is often lauded as the key to a more sustainable world, and luxury clothing brands are now doing their bit to make it a reality The concept of a circular economy is often lauded as the key to a more sustainable world, and luxury clothing brands are now doing their bit to make it a reality. The goal is to create a closed-loop system where materials are recycled and repurposed, and to achieve this, a growing number have launched initiatives that encourage customers to return used products to them when they are finished with them. These are often then recycled to create new products, reducing waste and minimising the brand\u2019s overall environmental impact. As part of their commitment to this, luxury brands are investing more money into technology, collaborating with renowned research institutions to create new materials that have a lesser impact on the environment and can be more easily recycled \u2013 and it\u2019s a move that extends to improving their processes overall. Consumer education Channels like social media have served as a valuable platform for communicating and spreading awareness of the importance of making informed and environmentally-conscious decisions. Image credit: ibphoto\/Bigstock.com Whilst it\u2019s true that many high-end brands are adapting in such ways to cater to growing customer demand, some are actually the ones educating consumers on the importance of shopping more sustainably, and of holding the brands they choose to account over their practices. Through transparently communicating their own sustainability initiatives and highlighting the positive impact of choosing eco-friendly products, the brands themselves have played a sizable role in the societal shift we\u2019ve seen over the past few years, and it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. Channels like social media have served as a valuable platform for communicating and spreading awareness of the importance of making informed and environmentally-conscious decisions, and have helped them to empower consumers to make informed choices and embrace a more sustainable lifestyle in a way that just 20 years ago, wouldn\u2019t have been possible. The bottom line There\u2019s no denying that the fashion industry is undergoing a positive transformation when it comes to sustainability, and both consumer and luxury clothing brands are leading the charge. Whilst the increasingly environmentally-focused demands of the modern luxury customers means it\u2019s a case of adapt quickly or die for brands, some brands are themselves setting an inspiring example that encourages more conscious consumption. The move towards eco-friendly practices in luxury clothing represents a dramatic shift, and finally, a more sustainable future is on the horizon for the fashion world overall.","filter_flag":1}

Download ETAuto App Get Realtime updates Save your favourite articles Scan to download App New Delhi: The Renault Kwid , launched in 2015, created ripples in the market. It was a worthy challenger to the undisputed entry-level car champion Maruti Alto, and was the first vehicle of a European carmaker designed and developed locally for the local market.The Renault Nissan Technology and Business Center India Pvt Ltd RNTBCI ) wants to do the same under Renault-Nissan\u2019s revamped strategy for India, which plans rollout of 6 models, including 2 EVs, from 2025.\u201cThat's our goal: to create an impact, with competitive products, with good technology, and meeting the customer expectation,\u201d Debashis Neogi, MD, RNTBCI, told ETAuto.The responsibility for Gerard Detourbet , MD, A2SDU (Alliance A-segment Development Unit), also considered the father of the Kwid, was really big. The new responsibilities for Neogi and team in this disruptive age are no less. \u201cWe are having a bigger share than in the previous years, on local projects,\u201d Neogi said.In the emerging era of SDVs (Software Defined Vehicle), the new models, expected to help Renault and Nissan outgrow the marginal players tag, can be expected to have high software tech-led content. They will benefit from RNTBCI, a global CoE for software validation and CAE. Software related to body control, autonomous driving, infotainment, and connectivity, for example, are validated by engineers in RNTBCI.The growing trend of digital twin, and leveraging simulation technologies further to reduce costs and time to market, are also enhancing the demand for Indian engineers in RNTBCI, like in some other organisations.Around 75% of the team of 5,000 engineers at RNTBCI work on global projects, including on Renault\u2019s SDV programmes, slated for global launch from 2025. The SDV architecture will enable vehicles to remain always up-to-date throughout their life cycle, and be capable of integrating new functionalities without hardware modifications.Ten years after the Kwid\u2019s launch, RNTBCI has the next biggest challenge in delivering the 6 car projects. In between, the Triber compact MPV, and the twin compact SUVs of Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite helped the Indian engineering team at RNTBCI to scale up their capabilities and also earn the confidence of the global bosses to recognise the Centre\u2019s competence as a global vehicle development hub. With this, RNTBCI now isn\u2019t required to approach the HQ for engineering approvals for vehicle projects for India.\u201cOur ambition is to become a state of the art global vehicle development centre,\u201d Neogi, who also proudly states that RNTBCI is one of the largest engineering and technology development centres by any OEM, said. The launch of Triber, based on a modified version of the Renault\u2013Nissan Common Module Family-A segment ( CMF-A) platform is seen as the start of the second growth phase of the engineering hub. The Kwid is the first model on the CMF-A platform.The team at RNTBCI is working on and supporting global developments with latest technologies like connectivity, autonomous driving, electrification, SDV etc. \u201cWe became part of the global (Renault) team supporting them in their launches of cars in Europe, and for Nissan we have projects related to the US market and also for the European market,\u201d Neogi said.The engineering team in Chennai was tapped for flagship projects like the Nissan Ariya EV, and the Renault Rafale. The engineers \u201cworked on some aspects\u201d of the Ariya\u2019s upper body design and platform.The CAE centre at RNTBCI is one of the largest outside France and Japan. The Indian team has the responsibility to validate a car\u2019s durability, crash worthiness, noise, vibration and harshness, to name a few.RNTBCI is a joint venture between allies Renault and Nissan, with the French major having a 51% stake. It\u2019s now complementary to the global centres of the OEMs, Neogi said. Renault has engineering centres in Romania (mainly for its Dacia brand), Brazil (expertise in Flex Fuel), and Spain (Powertrain technologies). For Nissan, there's a technology development centre each in the UK, Spain, Mexico, and North America.Explaining the collaborative approach within the network, Neogi explains with an example. \u201cThe conceptor (in another country) who is designing the part, and the simulation engineer (in Chennai), they're part of the same team and they do a lot of iterative loops together and keep on optimising till they get the best combination of cost, performance and quality.\u201dEvery car project presents different challenges for the RNTBCI team. While such challenges are cherished, one key challenge that Neogi would like not to have is one related to attracting and retaining talent. \u201cThis has been our number one challenge and we are continuously working on it. Number two is how to keep abreast with the technology (developments),\u201d he said.To tackle the competition for talent, RNTBCI, like some other organisations, is expanding to places where talent lives. It has recently opened a 200-seat centre each in Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. The Hyderabad centre is mainly for Information Services (IS) and Information Technology (IT), and the one in Bengaluru is a combination of IS, IT and software development for cars.Apart from the 5,000-strong engineering team, there\u2019s also a 3,000-member team for ISIT projects both for Renault and Nissan. \u201cThey're providing enterprise solutions for let's say sales and marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, engineering,\u201d Neogi said, while adding that the engineering and ISIT teams also collaborate for off-board and on-board connectivity applications, not only for local cars, but also for regional cars, especially for Nissan\u2019s European region as well as for global applications.What could be unique is that RNTBCI also has BPO operations in the same campus, inside Chennai\u2019s Mahindra World City. \u201cAutomotive companies are no longer just producing and servicing cars but they're also putting lots of services in the car, as you say, IoT on wheels, or extended living space. So the collaborative efforts of ISIT and engineering is a strength for our centre, and global Renault and Nissan acknowledge this,\u201d Neogi saidEven as the talent competition grows, Neogi and team have to keep delivering the goods, for the local and global markets. Indian frugal engineering and lower cost of manpower and manufacturing will be leveraged further by both Renault and Nissan.Some key learnings from the Kwid project will be more than handy. \u201cThe Kwid program showed how the design-to-cost principle works.

This agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the HanesBrands Board of Directors, is the successful conclusion of the Company\u2019s previously announced evaluation of a range of strategic options for the global Champion business. HanesBrands has made significant progress in recent years to reignite its innerwear business, increase market share, attract younger consumers, and strengthen its operating model. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company intends to focus on extending its leadership position in the innerwear category and generating above-market growth through continued consumer-centric product innovation and increased investment across its portfolio of leading brands, including Hanes, Bonds, Maidenform, and Bali. Bill Simon, Chairman of the Board said, \u201cFollowing a thorough review of options for the global Champion business with the support of our financial and legal advisors, we are pleased to have reached this agreement with Authentic Brands Group that we believe maximizes value for Champion and best positions HanesBrands for long-term success. Importantly, we believe this transaction will enable the Company to accelerate its debt reduction while positioning HanesBrands to deliver consistent growth and cash flow generation through a focused strategy on advancing its leading innerwear brands and optimizing its world-class supply chain.\u201d Steve Bratspies, CEO stated, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of significant effort by our teams to position all of our brands on the optimal path for the future. Over the past three years, we have taken necessary actions to enhance the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance \u2013 returning to historical gross margins, reducing our cost structure, lowering our debt levels, and generating consistent cash flow. The successful completion of this transaction further simplifies our business, deleverages our balance sheet, and enhances the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance. As we begin the next chapter for HanesBrands, we believe we\u2019re in an even stronger position to further extend our leadership in innerwear, pursue new cost reduction opportunities as we ensure we have the right operating structure in place, and advance our multi-year flywheel to drive strong shareholder returns.\u201d The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024. Subsequent to the closing, HanesBrands will provide certain transition services for Champion, including operating the business in select regions through a transition period. HanesBrands expects net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $900 million, including working capital adjustments and other customary transaction costs and excluding the contingent cash consideration. In line with HanesBrands\u2019 commitment to debt reduction, the Company will utilize all net proceeds from the transaction to accelerate its reduction of debt and expects meaningful deleveraging on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. On a trailing 12-month basis as of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the global Champion business generated approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is net of approximately $60 million of stranded costs. The Company has specific plans to remove all stranded costs within a year of the transaction closing as it completes the transition of the business. The Company intends to classify Champion as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024 and as a result, expects to update its full-year 2024 guidance in conjunction with the release of its second-quarter earnings results. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Evercore are serving as financial advisors to HanesBrands, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Jones Day are serving as their legal advisors.","filter_flag":1}
