Sign up for Grist\u2019s weekly newsletter here. Feeling guilty about all those blue-and-white plastic Amazon bags piling up around the house? Fear not \u2014 they can be recycled! At least, that\u2019s what the packaging says. For years now, Amazon\u2019s plastic bags, bubble-lined mailers, and air pillows have featured the ubiquitous \u201cchasing arrows\u201d recycling symbol along with the words \u201cstore drop-off.\u201d The idea is simple: Since most curbside recycling programs don\u2019t accept this type of plastic \u2014 it\u2019s too expensive to process and can clog machines \u2014 consumers can instead leave it at retail stores across the country. From there, this plastic, known as \u201cfilm,\u201d will go to a specialized facility and be turned into new products. The problem, however, is that the system doesn\u2019t seem to be working. An investigation published Tuesday by the nonprofits Environment America and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, suggests that only a small fraction of Amazon\u2019s plastic packaging makes it to a material recovery facility, the term for operations that sort glass, metal, plastic, and other items for recycling. The packaging is much more likely to end up in a landfill, incinerator, export terminal, or in the hands of a company that downcycles plastic film into things like benches. The report adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that store drop-off programs are an ineffective solution to the escalating plastic pollution crisis. According to environmental groups, these programs help justify the ongoing production of single-use plastic, helping manufacturers and retailers evade accountability while alleviating consumer guilt. \u201cThe store drop-off system is really not working, and plastic film is not recyclable,\u201d said Jenn Engstrom, state director of U.S. PIRG\u2019s California chapter and a co-author of the report. To find out what happens to Amazon\u2019s plastic packaging, U.S. PIRG and Environment America attached small tracking devices \u2014 mostly Apple AirTags \u2014 to 93 bundles of Amazon plastic packaging marked for store drop-off and deposited them at retailers in 10 states. These stores, which were listed in an online directory, included mostly supermarkets like Safeway, Sprouts, Publix, Fred Meyer, QFC, and Whole Foods, although some bundles were placed at outlets like Kohl\u2019s or Home Depot. The report authors were able to determine the fate of about half the bundles, since, as expected, many of the trackers likely died before reaching a final destination. Of those that survived, 13 went to a landfill, two went to a waste incinerator, and three went to the Port of Los Angeles, suggesting that the bundles were destined for processing or disposal overseas. Only four trackers eventually made their way to a material recovery facility that sorts plastics for recycling. U.S. PIRG and Environment America said they were able to contact three of those facilities: Two specifically said they do not accept Amazon packaging, and the third said it accepts only paper and cardboard. Two dozen trackers ended up in the hands of Trex, a company that makes benches and decking out of discarded plastic. But U.S. PIRG and Environment America question whether Trex is using Amazon packaging in its products; the contents of store drop-off bins are often littered with food and beverages, likely rendering this plastic too contaminated to use in manufacturing. Trex did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment, but a similar company reports getting 70 to 80 percent of its plastic from \u201cback-of-the-house shrink wrap,\u201d referring to the material wrapped around shipping pallets, which tends to be cleaner than postconsumer plastic. Meanwhile, a Trex executive told Bloomberg News last year that there is not enough demand for recycled material to make store drop-off successful. \u201cAll the claims the companies are making are just greenwashing,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cRecycling\u2019s failed.\u201d While USPIRG and Environment America\u2019s investigation may be the largest of its kind, it isn\u2019t the first to find flaws in the store drop-off system. Last year, Bloomberg tracked 30 bundles of packaging and wrappers marked with the store drop-off icon and found that 13 of them \u2014 more than 40 percent \u2014 ended up at U.S. landfills. Just four made it to locations that can recycle plastic. A similar effort from ABC News found that about half of 46 bundles of plastic bags went to landfills and incinerators, while only four went to facilities \u201cthat say they are involved with recycling plastic bags.\u201d Jan Dell, an independent chemical engineer and founder of the environmental nonprofit The Least Beach Cleanup, has been deploying her own trackers too. Since December 2022, she hasn\u2019t traced a single bundle of film labeled for store drop-off to U.S. facilities that can turn the material into new bags. Twelve bundles have been sent to a landfill or waste station, and one to an incinerator. Four appeared to have traveled to Mexico, Vietnam, or Malaysia, countries that generally lack adequate recycling infrastructure. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely lying with these labels,\u201d Dell said. The store drop-off system has \u201cnever worked, it was never true.\u201d The labels in question are produced by an initiative called How2Recycle, which began selling them to big companies in 2012 \u2014 supposedly to clear up confusion among consumers and retailers about which products could be recycled. The initiative issues several versions of the recycling icon, with the one marked \u201cstore drop-off\u201d reserved for products, like plastic bags and film, that aren\u2019t accepted in curbside recycling programs. The store drop-off labels direct consumers to How2Recycle\u2019s website, which links to a directory of retail locations with ]collection receptacles. Until last year, that directory was found at BagandFilmDirectory.org and featured more than 18,000 locations \u2014 but the consulting firm managing it shut it down following ABC News\u2019 investigation, citing a lack of \u201creal commitment from the industry,\u201d as well as insufficient funding. Many of the locations listed did not actually have a receptacle, while the Target and Walmart locations appeared to be disposing of, rather than recycling, much of the film they received. \u201cThere\u2019s more of an illusion of stuff getting recycled than there actually is because there is an imbalance in supply and demand,\u201d Nina Butler, CEO of the consulting firm, told ABC News. How2Recycle now links customers to a different directory hosted at Earth911. How2Recycle did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment. As scrutiny has increased over the use of the store drop-off label, some companies have pledged to stop using it altogether. Mondelez, which owns brands including Oreo and Ritz, said in March 2023 that it plans to phase out the label by 2025. Dell said she\u2019s also noticed the label\u2019s disappearance from packaging sold by Target and Georgia Pacific, a company that sells toilet paper, paper towels, and other pulp products. Target and Georgia Pacific did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment. Read Next: Inside the industry push to label your yogurt cup \u2018recyclable\u2019 Amazon, for its part, did not respond to Grist\u2019s questions about its use of the store drop-off label. When Dell asked the company, during a Zoom meeting in 2020 that she shared with Grist, to provide evidence that its packaging is widely recycled through the store drop-off program \u2014 as required by California law \u2014 an Amazon spokesperson told the state recycling commission that the company has \u201creally high confidence that store drop-off is a solution that is available in California.\u201d Pat Lindner, Amazon\u2019s vice president of mechatronics and sustainable packaging, told Grist that the company has no control over how its packaging is handled \u201conce it has been disposed of by municipalities or recycling centers.\u201d A spokesperson said the company is investing in better recycling infrastructure while also reducing plastics use overall. As of last year, for example, Amazon has eliminated plastic from shipments delivered in Europe, likely in response to EU regulations banning several categories of single-use plastic. The company also eliminated plastic packaging in India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to ban single-use plastic nationwide by 2022. In the U.S. last year, Amazon launched an automated fulfillment center in Euclid, Ohio, that uses paper exclusively instead of plastic packaging, and the company said it\u2019s ramping up a program to ship items in their original packages instead of extra plastic ones. The company also said in a 2022 sustainability report that it was \u201cphasing out padded bags containing plastics in favor of recyclable alternatives,\u201d but the spokesperson did not address Grist\u2019s request to clarify the timeline for this transition. Environmental advocates agree that Amazon has made progress, but say it should be doing more to reduce the hundreds of millions of pounds of single-use plastic trash it generates every year \u2014 and that it should remove the How2Recycle symbol from its packaging. In California, where state legislation often sets a national standard, a truth-in-advertising law signed by the governor in 2021 may soon restrict the use of store drop-off labels unless companies can prove that the system is effective. A separate law will require single-use plastic packaging sold in the state to be demonstrably recycled at least 65 percent of the time by 2032, a threshold that may push manufacturers toward paper, which is far easier to recycle.

You can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here. Plastic recycling labels are everywhere: The ubiquitous \u201cchasing arrows\u201d symbol adorns everything from plastic bags and water bottles to kids\u2019 toys. Most commonly, these symbols appear with a number \u2014 1 through 7 \u2014 that identifies the type of plastic resin a product is made of. A number 1, for instance, corresponds to polyethylene terephthalate, or PET \u2014 the stuff that makes up water bottles. Number 6 is for polystyrene, used in foam cups and trays. The plastics industry insists these icons were never meant to indicate a product\u2019s recyclability, even though that is how they are often perceived by consumers. In fact, most plastics are not recyclable, largely because there is no market for materials labeled 3 through 7. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the widespread use of the chasing arrows. With no federal program to evaluate products\u2019 recyclability and issue labels for them, third-party organizations have stepped in to play this role instead. One organization in particular, How2Recycle, has devised an elaborate hierarchy with several versions of its own recycling symbol, which it sells to hundreds of companies ranging from Lowe\u2019s to Beyond Meat. The organization, whose parent nonprofit is based in Virginia, says it analyzes waste management systems nationwide to figure out whether companies\u2019 products and packaging are recyclable and then issues a corresponding label. It\u2019s ostensibly an attempt to clear up confusion among consumers about what should and shouldn\u2019t go into the blue bin. The group describes its markers as \u201crecycling labels that make sense.\u201d This summer, How2Recycle declared a big victory for the companies it sells labels to: It now considers a wide set of products made from polypropylene, or PP \u2014 the resin corresponding to the number 5 \u2014 to be \u201cwidely recyclable,\u201d meaning the organization thinks that more than 60 percent of Americans have access to a curbside or drop-off recycling program that accepts them. Polypropylene accounts for about 14 percent of the U.S.\u2019s plastic production. The announcement makes polypropylene tubs, bottles, and jars \u2014 things like yogurt containers and ketchup bottles \u2014 eligible for How2Recycle\u2019s top-tier recycling label: a chasing arrows symbol with no qualifications. But industry experts and environmental advocates have raised their eyebrows. Based on federal recycling data, independent national waste management surveys, and firsthand accounts from material sorting facilities, polypropylene recycling isn\u2019t nearly as widespread as How2Recycle\u2019s labeling implies. Even if PP products were technically accepted by facilities that serve a majority of Americans \u2014 which researchers say they are not \u2014 polypropylene is much more commonly landfilled or incinerated than turned into new products. This is because it is often filled with toxic chemical additives or contaminated with food waste, both of which make it difficult to turn it into new products. It\u2019s usually less economical to sort out polypropylene for recycling than to simply discard it and make new products from virgin material. \u201cPost-consumer PP packaging and products have never been recyclable or recycled \u2026 above a few percent,\u201d said Jan Dell, an independent chemical engineer and founder of the advocacy group The Last Beach Cleanup. Through How2Recycle, she said, plastic and packaging companies are \u201ccreating their own non-verified data\u201d and ignoring key provisions of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Green Guides, a set of requirements meant to prevent companies from making deceptive claims about the environmental benefits of their products. As a result, Dell said, the industry has been allowed to deepen the public\u2019s confusion about recycling, gulling people and policymakers into thinking that it will be able to keep pace with plastic manufacturers\u2019 plans to dramatically scale up production. How2Recycle is part of a labyrinth of organizations and industry membership programs that promote \u201csustainable materials management.\u201d When it officially launched in 2012, the organization branded itself as an attempt to clear up confusion among consumers about what they could recycle. Many companies \u2014 including Yoplait, Costco, REI, and Microsoft \u2014 were quick to sign on, eager to affix How2Recycle\u2019s labels to their products. The program took the onus off of individual companies for claims about recyclability. How2Recycle would do all the necessary research into specific products\u2019 recycling rates and community access to recycling programs, allowing participants to rest assured that their recycling labels were compliant with federal law. Today, more than 400 companies pay annual membership fees to place How2Recycle labels on their packages, including Amazon, Clif Bar, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, and Starbucks. At the top of How2Recycle\u2019s labeling hierarchy is a simple \u201cchasing arrows\u201d recycling symbol, which the organization gives to products that it says are accepted by curbside or drop-off recycling programs that serve at least 60 percent of the American population. This is the label that How2Recycle said in late July some polypropylene products would now be eligible for. Previously, in 2020, the organization had downgraded PP products from the unqualified chasing arrows to a \u201cCheck Locally\u201d label that instructed consumers to verify whether their community\u2019s recycling program would accept them. \u201cAs rigid polypropylene access, sortation, and end markets are on an upward trend across the U.S., we are excited to upgrade this packaging format,\u201d Caroline Cox, How2Recycle\u2019s director, said in a press release this summer. However, other sources paint a very different picture of the United States\u2019 plastic recycling landscape \u2014 especially for polypropylene, which is far more difficult to turn into new products than How2Recycle\u2019s labels make it seem. \u201cIt is not possible that 60 percent of Americans have access to established recycling systems that accept PP packaging of any type,\u201d Dell, of The Last Beach Cleanup, said. First, she explained, industry data suggests that only 60 percent of Americans have access to any recycling program, let alone one that accepts polypropylene containers. Most facilities only accept plastics that are easier to recycle, such as bottles made of PET. And additional data that Dell is compiling for 2022 shows that only half of the country\u2019s 373 material recovery facilities, or MRFs \u2014 specialized plants that process and sort all the items people toss in their blue bins \u2014 say they accept polypropylene tubs, one of the most recyclable PP products out there (think margarine containers and cottage cheese cups). As a result, only 28 percent of Americans have access to recycling programs that accept these polypropylene containers. \u201cOverall accessibility for plastic recycling has dropped, if anything,\u201d said John Hocevar, Greenpeace\u2019s oceans campaign director. In recent years, labor shortages and high prices for recycled materials have caused cuts in curbside recycling programs, and many MRFs have stopped accepting most plastic resins. What\u2019s more, Hocevar and others argue that the accessibility of recycling programs is a distraction from a more important metric: the real recycling rate. Just because polypropylene is collected doesn\u2019t mean it will ultimately be recycled. According to the most recent available data from the Environmental Protection Agency, only 2.7 percent of polypropylene \u201ccontainers and packaging\u201d were recycled in 2018. If you include all forms of polypropylene, that number falls to just 0.6 percent. One reason PP is difficult to recycle is that it\u2019s not as clean or pure as other kinds of plastic. Unlike products made from PET or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) \u2014 labeled with the numbers 1 and 2, respectively \u2014 polypropylene products, labeled with the number 5, often contain toxic additives that make it difficult to turn them back into usable items. Another reason is that PP is typically collected in bales of mixed plastic that include a variety of resins labeled with the numbers 3 through 7. In order to be recycled, PP must be picked out of these bales and then sold to an extremely limited number of facilities that will actually accept that plastic. (\u200b\u200bIn 2020, Greenpeace estimated that the U.S. only had enough processing capacity to recycle less than 5 percent of its PP waste.) The whole process is prohibitively expensive, especially since the final product must be competitively priced against virgin plastics. According to the EPA, the U.S. generated more than 8 million tons of polypropylene waste in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available. Jeff Donlevy, a member of California\u2019s Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling and general manager of Ming\u2019s Recycling, a company based in northern California, said that many facilities continue to accept polypropylene \u2014 even if they have no intention of recycling it \u2014 because of outdated, 10-or-more-year contracts with cities. At the time when many of these contracts were signed, MRFs said they would accept polypropylene because they could send mixed plastic bales to China for sorting and recycling. But in 2018, when China enacted its \u201cNational Sword\u201d policy and closed its borders to most plastic waste imports, U.S. MRFs were saddled with a glut of resins that are uneconomical and logistically difficult to turn into new products. Of the roughly 80 MRFs in California, Donlevy said the vast majority are not recycling plastics made of resins labeled number 3 and above. This includes polypropylene, number 5. Most facilities are \u201cjust landfilling whatever number 5 they get,\u201d he said. How2Recycle says on its website that it takes four factors into account when determining a product\u2019s recyclability \u2014 collection, sortation, reprocessing, and end markets \u2014 but it is not transparent about the exact methodology it uses to evaluate these criteria. Much of its data comes from an industry report conducted by How2Recycle\u2019s parent organization that looks at a \u201cnon-random\u201d sample of large recycling programs throughout the U.S., along with a random sample of recycling programs in smaller communities. In the most recent edition of the report, these censuses consisted of web searches for each recycling program to determine what kinds of plastic they accept. Environmental advocates question the results of these analyses, but they say the larger issue is that How2Recycle fails to say anything about the real recycling rate of PP products. Again, the \u201cwidely recyclable\u201d label is only supposed to reflect a material\u2019s acceptance by curbside and drop-off recycling programs. But this information is not printed on the organization\u2019s unconditional recycling labels. Donlevy said this oversight \u201cmisleads the public.\u201d It may also contravene sustainable packaging guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, a government agency that promotes consumer protection. By slapping recycling labels without qualifiers onto polypropylene tubs and other containers, How2Recycle appears to be ignoring key provisions of the FTC\u2019s Green Guides, a set of detailed but nonbinding requirements for claims about products\u2019 environmental benefits. The U.S. government does not have a program to issue or approve recycling labels, so this is the primary check for labels created by private groups. At the broadest level, the FTC says it is deceptive to \u201cmisrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is recyclable.\u201d This means that companies should not use a recycling label without qualifiers \u2014 like How2Recycle\u2019s gold standard chasing arrows symbol \u2014 unless they can prove that recycling facilities for their labeled products are available to at least 60 percent of consumers. Critically, the commission also calls on companies to substantiate that these facilities \u201cwill actually recycle, not accept and ultimately discard\u201d labeled products. Marketers \u201cshould not assume that consumers or communities have access to a particular recycling program merely because the program will accept a product,\u201d the FTC says in the Green Guides\u2019 statement of basis and purpose. Although the guides aren\u2019t legally binding, activity that is inconsistent with them can be used as evidence of a violation of the FTC Act\u2019s provisions on \u201cUnfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices\u201d and can result in fines or additional rulemaking. State governments can also cite the Green Guides when building false advertising or consumer protection cases. Dell lamented that the FTC has never, to her knowledge, taken action to stop a company from misusing an unqualified recycling label. But courts have. Take, for example, a 2018 lawsuit filed by a consumer against Keurig over claims that the company\u2019s polypropylene coffee pods were \u201crecyclable.\u201d Keurig argued that its labels were consistent with the Green Guides, but a U.S. District Court in California disagreed and refused to dismiss the case. The court said that even if the coffee pods were technically collected by municipal recycling programs, they were not in practice being recycled. Keurig settled the case this year for $10 million and has changed the labels on its coffee pods. Greenpeace argues that How2Recycle is using similar sleight with its own labels, claiming recyclability with insufficient substantiation. \u201cPolypropylene does not come close to meeting the requirements\u201d for recycling labels laid out by the FTC, the organization said in a press release. It is neither accepted at recycling facilities that serve 60 percent of the population nor actually recycled at a significant rate. In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, Paul Nowak \u2014 executive director of How2Recycle\u2019s parent organization, GreenBlue \u2014 said that How2Recycle\u2019s labels not only satisfy the Green Guides\u2019 requirements but \u201cgo beyond them.\u201d Although How2Recycle does not have internal data on the real recycling rate for polypropylene, Nowak said How2Recycle has reviewed \u201cletters of support\u201d from MRFs saying that they plan to expand their recycling capacity for polypropylene. Nowak declined to share these letters with Grist. How2Recycle\u2019s website offers some clarification. Although the organization claims to consider \u201csortation\u201d and \u201creprocessing\u201d for products that will feature its labels, How2Recycle explains online that it ultimately does not take into account the real-world recycling rate when evaluating a product\u2019s recyclability \u2014 in contrast to definitions of recyclability from other organizations, like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an international nonprofit that advocates for a circular economy. Nowak insists that How2Recycle spent \u201cseveral months\u201d verifying data on the increased recyclability of polypropylene. But Dell thinks there\u2019s an irresolvable conflict of interest at play, since How2Recycle and the organizations whose data it cites are run and funded by companies that make and sell plastics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all these front groups funded by the plastics and products industry to create and perpetuate the myth that plastics are recyclable,\u201d she said. The recent push to make polypropylene \u201cwidely recyclable\u201d started outside How2Recycle, with a separate industry group called the Recycling Partnership \u2014 a nonprofit whose board of directors includes executives for major brands and plastic industry groups: Keurig Dr. Pepper, Nestl\u00e9, the Association of Plastic Recyclers, and the American Beverage Association, among others. The organization lists roughly 80 \u201cfunding partners\u201d on its website, including two of North America\u2019s main petrochemical industry trade groups, the American Chemistry Council and the Plastics Industry Association. In 2020, a few months after How2Recycle downgraded PP products to only be eligible for the \u201cCheck Locally\u201d label, the Recycling Partnership launched a new initiative \u2014 directly funded by many plastic brands and industry trade groups \u2014 to \u201censure the long-term viability of polypropylene.\u201d The Recycling Partnership claims it contributed to a spike in polypropylene recycling over the past two years through a series of 24 grants worth $6.7 million. The group did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for more information, but a press release notes that the funding helped \u201csupport sorting improvements and community education across the U.S.\u201d According to the Recycling Partnership, these grants increased the amount of polypropylene recovered by 25 million pounds annually. Now, the group says its proprietary \u201cNational Recycling Database\u201d shows 65 percent of Americans having access to PP recycling. According to Nowak, the Recycling Partnership approached How2Recycle with this data in early 2022, requesting that How2Recycle reevaluate its labeling for polypropylene. After what Nowak described as a lengthy evaluation process, he said the data matched what he was seeing with How2Recycle\u2019s own analysis, as well as information provided by an outside consulting firm. In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, the consulting firm said it provided How2Recycle with access-to-recycling data and \u201cend market\u201d research to show there is a market for polypropylene that ultimately does get recycled. The firm did not share data on polypropylene\u2019s real recycling rate and told Grist to reach out to the Recycling Partnership. How2Recycle, meanwhile, has its own web of connections to big brands and the plastics industry. The group\u2019s parent organization, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, is an industry working group whose members include Procter and Gamble, Coca-Cola, and the ExxonMobil Chemical Company, as well as a host of other plastic makers. GreenBlue, the umbrella organization that houses How2Recycle and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, has a board of directors that includes executives from the Dow Chemical Company, Mars, the packaging companies Printpack and Westrock, and more. Nowak said he is aware of concerns over potential conflicts of interest, but that How2Recycle\u2019s parent organizations are \u201cvery careful about who we start to work with.\u201d At How2Recycle, he added, \u201cwe stay neutral in all that.\u201d Dell has often spoken of the plastic labeling landscape as the \u201cwild, wild West,\u201d with \u201cno sheriff in town\u201d to protect consumers from deceptive recycling claims. The FTC, whose Green Guides may soon be updated for the first time since 2012, declined to comment on How2Recycle\u2019s labeling system, and environmental advocates have expressed frustration that the commission hasn\u2019t done more to enforce the guidelines. Without stronger government regulation, Dell said, \u201cHow2Recycle and the product companies have filled the void to become the deciders\u201d of what should and shouldn\u2019t bear the recycling label. But states are catching on. California passed nation-leading legislation last year making it illegal for companies to use the chasing arrows on products that are not actually being turned into new products. (In this case the state, rather than How2Recycle, will determine recyclability, and it will take into account both collection and the real recycling rate.) The law is expected to eliminate recycling symbols on virtually all plastic packaging that isn\u2019t made of number 1 or number 2 resins, since those are the only kinds of plastic currently being recycled with significant regularity. It could have an impact on other states, too \u2014 if plastic manufacturers decide it is too cumbersome to create new product lines for the California market, they could decide to remove recycling symbols for the whole country. Hocevar of Greenpeace said the California bill is an important step in the right direction and called on other states to adopt similar policies. Environmental advocates have also cheered a separate effort from the California attorney general\u2019s office, which announced in April that it was launching an investigation into the petrochemical industry\u2019s \u201caggressive campaign to deceive the public\u201d about the feasibility of recycling. To truly address the plastic pollution crisis, Hocevar and others say that the top priority should be turning off the tap \u2014 limiting the production of plastic that ultimately has to be dealt with. In the U.S., perhaps the most promising move in this direction is the proposed Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, a far-reaching federal bill that would ban carryout plastic bags and other single-use plastic products, require plastics companies to launch and finance programs to manage the waste they produce, and place a moratorium on new petrochemical facilities until the EPA can undertake a comprehensive assessment of the industry\u2019s environmental impact. In the meantime, Donlevy said that companies should stop trying to trick consumers into feeling good about their plastic consumption. \u201cProducers have to realize they\u2019re using plastic for their benefit and for the consumers\u2019 benefit, which is fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to put a recycling symbol and say that that cottage cheese or cream cheese or sour cream container is recyclable? You don\u2019t need to do that, that\u2019s not a part of the sales pitch. \u2026 The only plastics that are really getting recycled in the U.S. are number 1 and number 2 bottles.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
