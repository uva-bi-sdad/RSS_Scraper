Qcells added 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity to Dalton, bringing the full factory's output to more than 5.1 GW. The Qcells Dalton factory is the largest manufacturing plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first solar panel plant expansion since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This addition marks the first phase of Qcells' historic $2.5 billion investment announced in January 2023. The completed Dalton expansion created 510 additional solar factory jobs and will also assemble two new solar products: the Q.TRON G2 residential solar panel and a bifacial panel for the commercial and utility markets. Qcells' Dalton factory will manufacture nearly 30,000 solar panels per day. Beyond Dalton, the investment includes the development of a fully-integrated solar supply chain factory in Cartersville, Georgia. The highly anticipated Cartersville factory will manufacture solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished panels. By 2024, between the Dalton and Cartersville facilities, Qcells anticipates its solar production capacity to reach 8.4 GW a year, enough to power 1.3 million homes annually with clean energy. \"Completing this factory marks the third expansion we've made in Dalton, and it's just the beginning of Qcells' larger mission to build a fully integrated solar supply chain in America,\" said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells. \"The Inflation Reduction Act and the efforts of Georgia's economic development team helped make these ambitious plans possible, and with it thousands of careers in clean energy. As we build new solar technology from Dalton and prepare for the start of Cartersville, it is critical that our local to federal leaders continue to work not only with us, but the larger industry to ensure our collective investments deliver for communities for decades to come.\" \"Out of all the places Qcells could have gone, they chose to operate and expand here in Georgia because of our unrivaled assets and the competitive package we put together in 2019,\" said Governor Brian Kemp. \"This latest milestone is a testament to the hard work of the Dalton community and the relationship we've built on the state level with this innovative company. We look forward to the new jobs this expansion will bring for Georgians in that area.\" \"When I wrote and passed the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, it was with this exact goal in mind. I thank Qcells for their continued investment in Georgia,\" U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff said. \"Our state is emerging as the advanced energy capital of the nation, thanks to Federal infrastructure and manufacturing policies that are benefiting Georgia more than any other state in the country.\" \"With Qcells' multi-billion dollar factory expansion in north Georgia up and running, Georgians are seeing the real-time benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act and its clean energy provisions as our state continues to embark on a green energy revolution,\" said Senator Reverend Warnock. \"With over 500 solar manufacturing jobs added in the process, Qcells is proving that taking action to address climate change and growing our economy can go hand in hand. I look forward to continuing to partner with Qcells as our state becomes the premier destination for the solar manufacturing industry.\" Qcells opened its first factory in Georgia in 2019 and hired 750 people to manufacture 1.7 GW of solar. This initial investment was made possible in part by the Section 201 tariffs imposed on solar cells. As the nation's demand for solar grew, so did Qcells' investment in its Dalton facility. Last year, Qcells announced a plan to add 1.4 GW to its manufacturing output and hire 535 more people. This now completed third expansion, as well as Qcells investments across the full solar value chain, follow the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act within the IRA and are made possible with the incredible support from Georgia's economic development team. Qcells' new products \u2013 the Q.TRON G2 and their new bifacial panels \u2013 represent the company's next generation of solar and underscores its commitment to developing reliable, cost-effective products at scale. These products also showcase Qcells' larger commitment to sustainability. Both products will likely achieve an ecolabel known as EPEAT, which helps customers identify sustainably made products. Qcells' completed Dalton factory expansion and current development in Cartersville aim to accelerate the United States' shift towards renewable energy. Upon completed construction, Qcells' production in Georgia could avoid more than 12 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year while expanding domestic manufacturing of solar products amidst the push for Made-in-America clean energy solutions.

This investment will help advance the expansion of the global carbon credit market and spur further investment in emissions-reductions programs and technologies. \"British Columbia has a unique opportunity to lead the advancement of carbon management solutions by establishing MMV pathways and innovations,\" said Todd Sayers, Chief Operating Officer of the B.C. Centre for Innovation and Clean Energy. \"CICE is proud to lead catalytic investment into Arca, Metaspectral, Miraterra, and Quatern Limited Partnership and looks forward to seeing their solutions reach global scaling and climate impact potential.\" CICE launched the call for MMV innovation in June 2023, and welcomed over 100 potential applicants. Using an intelligent risk-taking framework, CICE strives to maximize potential impact of breakthrough clean energy and climate solutions by: Identifying the optimal convergence points of decarbonization and real-world readiness backed by CICE research and industry consultation Accelerating clean energy adoption and growth by mobilizing collaboration between government, industry, investors, academia and Indigenous rights holders De-risking investment in early stage cleantech and climate solutions through a government and industry co-funding model MMV funding recipients include: Arca is developing MMV technology for quantifying and validating carbon dioxide removal via carbon mineralization - a geochemical process that removes atmospheric CO2 and permanently stores it as rock - in alkaline waste. While Arca's carbon dioxide removal technologies are currently focused on mine tailings, its MMV technology will be applicable to all methods of surficial carbon mineralization - which are estimated to have a total carbon dioxide removal (CDR) capacity in excess of 1 billion tonnes per year. Metaspectral is creating a precise and cost-efficient method of assessing, quantifying, and tracking the carbon sequestration capacity of land for various industries, including agriculture. AI models ingest hyperspectral imagery in real-time to measure concentrations and fluxes of greenhouse gasses more accurately - specifically CO2 and CH4, but also N2O. With a more efficient way to measure the carbon sequestration capacity of large fields, farmers are able to optimize their practices - such as tillage, over-cropping, fertilization, and watering - to maximize the carbon sequestration potential of their land. Miraterra is developing a faster, more affordable way to test the soil quality of farm fields. Its proprietary Raman sensors provide near instantaneous measurement of key soil components including pH, soil organic carbon, soil organic matter, and NPK. This technology is fast, delivers results at approximately one-third the cost of conventional sampling, eliminates the need for toxic chemicals in conventional soil testing, and will ultimately be deployable in-field. This funding will accelerate the world's ability to measure permanence of carbon sequestered in soil via Miraterra's breakthrough carbon sub-pool measurement system. Quatern Limited Partnership is a collaboration between Quatsino First Nation and Western Forest Products Inc., who will be implementing a technology to measure the change in carbon sequestration of forests due to large-scale fertilization efforts. A technology called Treeid will be used to analyze growth rates of individual trees using LiDAR data collected several years apart. In addition to quantifying the rate at which trees sequester carbon post-fertilization, this technology could also be applied to other forest management treatments such as reforestation and thinning.

Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf News Automechanika Dubai is one of the biggest international trade exhibition for the automotive aftermarket and service industry in the wider Middle East. It ran from October 2 to 4, hosted at the Dubai World Trade Center. One of the key participants was Autel, with their well-structured booth in Hall 1.

Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf News Salim Achahbar has been working with Autel for 17 years. The 37-year-old entrepreneur\u2019s company, autologic, is the official distributor of Autel in Morocco. \u201cWe sell a wide range of products including diagnostic tools and keys programing. However, we started with the basics, things like electronics and mechanical parts in vehicles. Over the years, we\u2019ve grown rapidly with Autel.\u201d When asked about the reason for choosing to collaborate with Autel, Achahbar said, \u201cOur core mission is not just selling tools and parts \u2013 essentially, we sell solutions to our customers. In addition, Autel is about solutions \u2013 this is why we chose Autel. Many years of experience in the industry has taught us that our journey with customers doesn\u2019t stop at the point where they have purchased our products. They need solutions, even after purchasing our products. We are there for our customers, and Autel is there for us. \u201cUtilising their robust knowledge, Autel has guided us through various questions and customer inquiries. These questions and inquiries can come in different forms. In these times of needs, Autel\u2019s support is critical. And so far, they\u2019ve been offering us great guidance on tackling these issues daily, despite the time differences.\u201d A firm believer in a sustainable future, Autel has been at the forefront of green initiatives, technological advancements, and eco-friendly development. Its UAE branch is working, primarily focused on the country\u2019s drive to promote clean energy solutions. Kemin Zuo, AUTEL IMEA DMCC General Manager Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf News The future: Digital energy In recent years, Autel has been focusing on developing new products in the \u2018digital energy\u2019 space. This is a system or process wherein there is constant feedback between the consumer and energy supplier, which will help in a smarter and more sustainable way of utilizing energy. An area that Autel is pushing digital energy development in is in the field of electric vehicles (EV), especially with reference to repair, maintenance, charging, solar energy, and energy storage. The company\u2019s core technologies are now being implemented in EV diagnostic devices, EV charging units, charge point operator cloud platform, solar energy and energy storage solutions. It is pushing for an integrated energy ecosystem in a rapidly expanding EV industry. As Achahbar said, \u201cThe automobile industry is undergoing significantly innovative changes. There is a shift to EV. We are upgrading our information with Autel to be in the present, and in the future of the automobile industry. For us, Autel is the best company to work with, for all automobile brands in terms of diagnostic, keys programing, and other tools such as battery, and TPMS (tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors. We chose Autel for the common passion we have for innovation in the automobile industry. \u201cAfter careful consideration, we chose to collaborate with Autel. Several factors from Autel align with our vision and values. Firstly, we were impressed with Autel\u2019s reputation and record of accomplishment within the industry. The company has a global presence and is renowned for providing durable, reliable, and innovative charging solutions and requirements that both our company and our customers value highly,\" says Alok Dayanand, senior product engineer at Dubai-based company Admiral Energy, which has been working with Autel for the past year, since 2022. Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf News Alok Dayanand, senior product engineer at Dubai-based company Admiral Energy, said that they have been working with Autel for the past year, since 2022. The firm is involved in the design, development, and management of customised, comprehensive charging ecosystems for deployment of fleet solutions, related to clean mobility. \u201cAfter careful consideration, we chose to collaborate with Autel. Several factors from Autel align with our vision and values. Firstly, we were impressed with Autel\u2019s reputation and record of accomplishment within the industry. The company has a global presence and is renowned for providing durable, reliable, and innovative charging solutions and requirements that both our company and our customers value highly. \u201cAutel\u2019s commitment to delivering high-quality charging solutions and exceptional customer service stood out from the competition. The partnership has enabled us to offer customers a seamless experience, ensuring that they have access to reliable and efficient charging infrastructure when they bring electric vehicles into their fleet.\u201d The \u2018green\u2019 Autel booth was swamped with visitors and partners visiting, during the three-day Automechanika Dubai event. Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf news In fact, one of the challenges Dayanand\u2019s firm faced with deploying EV chargers was the availability of power in a range of locations, along with adjusting to the summer temperature. \u201cHowever, with Autel\u2019s broad range of charger sizes, we have been able to deploy DC (direct current) chargers of lower power to our customers. In addition, Autel\u2019s IP54 rating and high operating temperature have performed exceptionally even during peak summer time. \u201cThe demand for EV charging stations in the UAE is high, especially under the country\u2019s plan to expand its EV charging infrastructure. Autel\u2019s EV chargers will continue to support our journey towards carbon neutrality.\u201d What is IP54 rating? According to electricalcounter.co.uk, \u201cAn IP54 rating means that your product will be protected against contamination from limited amounts of dust and other particles. Additionally, you can be confident that it will be protected from water sprays from all directions.\u201d An evening celebrating progress, partners and achievements On October 2, Autel extended their gratitude to its global partners by inviting them to a dinner and awards event. At 8pm, Dubai-based Address Sky View Hotel ballroom was filled with laughter and conversation over dinner tables, while several awards were given to honour Autel\u2019s global partners. The event also featured several rounds of raffle draws. Dina Haddad, business development director at Markazia Group, which is the distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and other automotive brands in Jordan, who attended the event, said, \u201cOur partnership with Autel started in the first half of 2023, when we became Autel's official partner in Jordan. In the process of searching for EV Charger suppliers, we focused on three elements: quality, price, and strong technical support. Autel fulfiled all these three elements. \u201cTheir wide range of EV Charger options, continuous development of new products, as well as competitive price, helps us to serve a wider audience. Not to mention the training and hands-on technical support Autels\u2019 regional office provided to us. Their approach to listen to customers and their ability to adapt to changes are truly laudable. \u201cCountries around the world are setting ambitious objectives to transition themselves to EVs as part of their green initiatives. There is no doubt that EV is the future. In Jordan, this year alone, 40 per cent of newly registered vehicles are EV. To be able to cope with this transition, the infrastructure must be readily available to EV customers, and we are driven to provide that readiness. \u201cWe are very happy to be part of today\u2019s partner event, it helps us to network, get to know the partners in the region, share ideas and learn from each other\u2019s\u2019 experiences.\u201d Dina Haddad, business development director at Markazia Group, which is the distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and other automotive brands in Jordan, who attended the event, said, \u201cOur partnership with Autel started in the first half of 2023, when we became Autel's official partner in Jordan.\" Image Credit: Anas Thacharpadikkal\/Gulf News To Achahbar, Autel\u2019s partner event is more like a \u201cfamily event\u201d. \u201cAs dealers, we have information on what our customers need, so we give feedback to Autel and they in turn develop relevant products for us. This type of event offers the opportunity to meet with the Autel team face to face, it bonds us like a family.\u201d \u201cWe are excited to hear Autel\u2019s plans and initiatives for the region and discuss new products with the team. It\u2019s an event that is truly appreciated,\u201d Dayanand concluded. A partner event is a valuable platform to align our customers and partners with Autel's future plans and goals. We had good communication and built better trust. The event also served as a platform for receiving valuable feedback from our partners. Their insights can help fine-tune our plans and strategies. - Kemin Zuo, regional director of AUTEL IMEA DMCC A sentiment reiterated by Kemin Zuo, regional director of AUTEL IMEA DMCC, \u201cI've been with Autel since June 2016. With over seven years of experience at Autel, I have had the opportunity to witness and contribute to the company's growth and development.
