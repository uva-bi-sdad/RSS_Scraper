Also making its d\u00e9but at the trade fair is an integrated cell for the artisan worker and many other new entries for all the application areas in secondary wood processing. SCM is preparing for the upcoming edition of Ligna \u2013 Hannover, 15-19th May \u2013 consolidated by a growth in double figures, that brought the Group\u2019s turnover in 2022 to \u20ac850m, and with technological proposals that meet the most current needs of a highly customised, versatile, interconnected and sustainable production. In an exhibition area covering 3000 sq m between hall 13 and hall 16 (the latter referring to the Superfici technologies for finishing), visitors to Ligna will have an opportunity to discover the vast range of new products developed by the Italian Group to meet every production need when machining panels, solid wood, timber construction and joinery production. SCM\u2019s Smart&Human Factory for the furniture industry will be live at Ligna Innovation with a common goal: to make processes more efficient, keep costs, consumption and waste down and simplify their management, as is the case with the Smart&Human Factory that will be presented in Hannover in two distinct versions for industry and the artisan. \u201cAt Ligna,\u201d says Pietro Gheller, SCM\u2019s Product & Markets Director, \u201cwe will give solid evidence of our ability to provide top-quality solutions for every woodworking application. We will present advanced automation systems that stand apart for being modular and configurable to suit the customer\u2019s needs and support a top-quality, flexible production while still guaranteeing high standards in efficiency and productivity\u201d. \u201cThe new SCM digital factory,\u201d continues Gheller, \u201cis integrated and interconnected to the company\u2019s MES systems to optimise more complex production flows. Furthermore, it allows for real-time, 360\u00b0 planning and monitoring of all the process stages, even remotely: from the order to design, right up to the after-sales service. \u201cThe aim is the encourage an optimal, more sustainable use of energy resources and the materials used by the customer, as well as improve the plant\u2019s resources, by pre-empting the need for maintenance and preventing any machine stops thanks to the data collected being processed.\u201d The Smart&Human Factory for the furniture industry The system of flexible cells on display in Hannover can produce around 400 furnishing components per shift and is mainly aimed at furniture kit manufacturers. This is one of the many configurations that the Smart&Human Factory can assume based on customer demands. The cells are integrated with articulated robots and connected by unmanned AMR shuttles. Gabbiani GT 2 beam saw In the beam saw area, SCM will be presenting its new Gabbiani GT2 flexible cell with articulated robot for automatic loading and unloading. The cell has been designed to optimise shifts and combine batch one machining needs with those of large-volume production. The cell is enhanced by the new Maestro Optiwise optimiser, and has been designed for manned or unmanned use, allowing for immediate and automatic switching between one mode and another: the robot positions or removes the additional modules between the shelves, for efficient working. In automatic mode with robot, the cell allows for work to be done with no shift limitations, relieving the operator of low-value work, and allowing for even small, finished pieces to be handled very easily. Pack cutting can be performed when operating in manned mode. In the edgebanding area, SCM will be presenting a Stefani Cell E flexible cell that combines the numerous advantages of the Stefani X industrial edgebander, in terms of productivity and machining quality, with the advantages of a flexible and automated integration of the entire production loop. In a logic of complete automation, the panels are supplied autonomously to the edgebander by an industrial articulated robot. On exiting, the Pickback Bridge System guarantees the timely return of the panels after longitudinal or transversal machining. The cell is governed by Maestro Active Edge HMI software for a simple, intuitive control, and is designed for an intensive use over several shifts, with a speed of 25 metres per minute. It guarantees an ideal application of the edge without the use of glue, thanks to AirFusion+ technology, and outstanding machining quality even on the most delicate, state-of-the-art materials thanks to electronic controls. Other new entries include the Morbidelli CX220 drilling and dowelling flexible cell with robot that creates all the parts of a piece of furniture more efficiently, even with pieces that differ considerably from one another. The cell produces a panel per minute and up to more than 400 panels per shift with a single operator in just 50 sq m. Its exclusive layout allows for two possible uses: unmanned, thanks to the integrated robot on the rear side that performs all the loading and unloading operations in complete autonomy for a continuous production cycle; with partial supervision by the operator who, in complete safety, can load and unload the panels at the front of the cell while the robot continues to machine on the opposite side. The process is completed with the Cut C200 right size box-making machine, a new solution for batch one cardboard box packaging that produces up to four boxes per minute in different shapes and sizes. The secret? The high advancement speed and use of a brushless motor with extremely fast positioning set-up while the order-by-order production is enhanced by separate longitudinal cutting and creasing units and by a transversal unit. Another advantage is the optimisation of the consumption of cardboard based on the actual size of the box produced, choosing between three kinds of feed: single-sheet cardboard or continuous module, with flanked modules or with automatic switch up to eight modules. Smart&Human Factory for the artisan Also taking centre stage at Ligna is an integrated cell for flexible and customised production from the raw material to the finished piece of furniture. As well as MES Maestro easyFlow, ideal for creating the perfect integration between the office and production area, the cell benefits from the advantages of the machines involved, considerably reducing times and margins of error. The Invincibile SI X circular saw is reinforced by SCM\u2019s Thundercut optimiser-cutting sequencer, the only one to guide the operator one step at a time when inserting the panel into the machine and when cutting. Startech CN V Startech CN Plus CNC drilling centre has been designed to produce furniture parts easily and flexibly without repositioning the tools and without a need for operator intervention.

Furthermore, thanks to the exclusive \u201cSelf-Refilling\u201d technology, a distinctive advantage of SCM\u2019s laser unit, it is possible to make the most of the features in terms of power without further interruptions to the production flow. A vast range of new Superfici solutions for finishing will also be presented in hall 16, stand C6-D5. A dedicated area will be given over to the new Compact XL in the sprayers section: designed to offer excellent production capacity, it reflects the company\u2019s worth, increasingly focused on energy saving, thanks to a more efficient paint recovery system and improved air circulation. All this is spiced up by a completely new design. Also on display is a UV LED polymerisation system with several UV monochromatic sources of different wavelengths to achieve a controlled multi-chromatic emission in a wider spectrum compared to the pure UV LED radiation. The result is chemical-physical performances fully comparable with standard UV polymerisation, while maintaining the typical advantages offered by led. For extra-opaque effects on the finish of the most varied end products and materials, another new entry will be the Superfici excimatt: excimer technology offering surprisingly smooth effects with high levels of opacity but with no more compromising on surface resistance. Important new entries for the timber construction industry as well. SCM will be presenting Oikos XS, the new CNC machining centre designed to meet the needs of new applications and new markets. Maximum implementation speed, precision and reduced bulk are the advantages of this model designed for all those companies involved in the production of prefabricated walls, trusses, roofs and blockhaus. Also highlighted is the new Maestro active beam&wall human-machine interface software for all the CNC machining centres used in timber constructions. Programming, control and optimisation of the production flow directly on the machine are now possible in an even simpler, more intuitive fashion. Even SCM\u2019s solutions for sanding are now applied to timber construction. SCM will be presenting DMC System XL the highly modular automatic sanding-calibrating machine, capable of machining X-Lam\/CLT wall panels up to 3700mm in width and 500mm thick. Alongside the SCM stand, in hall 13, there will be an opportunity to discover the latest from Randek, innovative technologies manufacturer for the prefabricated housing market and partner to SCM in providing solutions for the entire timber construction industry. On display, for solid wood machining, the Hypsos five-axis machining centre with integral booth, devised for designers and the three-dimensional machining of complex-shaped and large parts. Space is also given over to the Connexus FI numerically controlled tenoning-mortising machines, completely new at Ligna 2023, designed to satisfy all the machining demands of different kinds of solid wood or coated MDF cabinet doors in a single machine, including complex joins such as mitre door, face frame and French joint on cabinet doors and shutters. The squaring-profiling technology will be represented by a Celaschi SP single-sided profiling unit designed to machine parts of cabinet doors and characterised by a working unit made up of an electro-spindle with HSK attachment associated to an automatic eight-position tool magazine. The relative eye-M console will show all the potentials of the new Maestro active square interface. Among the new entries for woodworking, making its debut is the Startech CN K compact three-axis machining centre, ideal for any kind of routing, decorations, scoring, creation of signs and 3D model prototype. The only one in its category to have a 2.4kW electro-spindle, the machine, with integral booth, guarantees protection to the operator and a clean working environment; it is also very easy to program thanks to the virtual \u2018open\u2019 human-machine interface for the importing of G-code from any kind of CAD\/CAM software. Also being highlighted are the new Eye-S compact touch controls on edgebanders and the exclusive \u2018Blade Off\u2019 technological solution applied to circular saws and fitted with exclusive smart sensors to machine in complete safety. www.scmgroup.com","filter_flag":1}
