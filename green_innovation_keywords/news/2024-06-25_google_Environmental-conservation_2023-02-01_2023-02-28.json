(Otsuka) has finalized a collaborative agreement with Naruto City (Tokushima Prefecture, Japan; Mayor: Michihiko Izumi) and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (Head office: Nagoya, Japan; President: Ichiro Kashitani) aiming to contribute to realization of a sustainable society through promotion of horizontal \"bottle-to-bottle\" recycling of PET bottles. The agreement was finalized on February 9, 2023. \u25a0Objectives of Collaboration 1 Used PET bottles collected from the municipality will be recycled as resin for production of PET bottles with the aim of promoting Japan-based bottle-to-bottle resource circulation (horizontal recycling). 2 The three participating entities will collaborate for collection, manufacturing, and sales, aiming to promote effective circulation of resources and contribute to the realization of a sustainable environment, economy, and society. 3 This new approach to resource recycling will be launched in Naruto City, Japan, where Otsuka was founded, in order to contribute to achieving a circular economy*1, identified as a material issue in the environmental policies adopted by the Otsuka group of companies. From the perspectives of limiting use of petroleum-based materials and promoting resource circulation, the soft drink industry*2 is working to develop horizontal bottle-to-bottle recycling, in which used PET bottles are reproduced as PET bottles for re-use. Previously, PET bottles discarded by households have been recycled as food packaging trays, textiles, and other items, while bottles that didn't meet the quality requirements for recycling were incinerated. However, recent technological innovations have made it possible to create high quality recycled PET material from used PET bottles, leading to increased adoption of horizontal bottle-to-bottle recycling initiatives. With this technology, semi-permanent recycling of PET bottles becomes a possibility. Resulting reductions in consumption of petroleum-based resources and decreased CO 2 emissions are expected to reduce the overall environmental impact of business activities. . With achievement of a circular economy defined as one of the material issues addressed by the Otsuka group's environmental policy, the Otsuka Group Plastic Policy*3 was formulated with the aim of developing containers and packaging suitable for a sustainable society. In collaboration with stakeholders, Otsuka group companies are engaged in various efforts to achieve environmental goals*4. Through collection of used PET bottles for production of PET bottles, this collaborative agreement represents a yet another step toward realization of a sustainable society. After launching this initiative in Naruto City, the birthplace of the Otsuka group of companies, Otsuka will continue to develop new initiatives to achieve a circular economy. *1 Use of sustainable materials *2 Japan Soft Drink Association: http:\/\/www.j-sda.or.jp\/about-jsda\/english.php *3 Otsuka Group Plastic Policy: https:\/\/www.otsuka.com\/en\/csr\/environment\/plastic.html *4 Otsuka Group Environmental Vision: https:\/\/www.otsuka.com\/en\/csr\/environment\/ Reference * Otsuka Group's Environmental Policy: https:\/\/www.otsuka.com\/en\/csr\/environment\/ * Otsuka Group Plastic Policy: https:\/\/www.otsuka.com\/en\/csr\/environment\/plastic.html","filter_flag":1}

While 1,4-dioxane is not a product ingredient but a by-product of the manufacturing process, the New York state legislature has still implemented regulations regarding its presence in consumer products. The law, which went into effect on December 31, 2022, has caused some confusion for manufacturers and suppliers to the beauty care industry. In response to the new law, the American Cleaning Institute (ACI), a trade organization representing the interests of U.S. cleaning product manufacturers and suppliers, has co-authored a study exploring different methods to assess 1,4-dioxane levels in commercial products available for consumer consumption. To learn more about 1,4-dioxane, the study\u2019s results, and the law\u2019s potential impact on the cosmetics and personal care product industries, CosmeticsDesign spoke with Kathleen Stanton, M.S., Associate Vice President, Technical & International Affairs at the ACI and Douglas G. Hayes, PhD, MBA Institute Professor at the Department of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science in University of Tennessee and Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Surfactants and Detergents\u200b for their insights. Both Kathleen and Doug served as panelists for a workshop on 1,4-dioxane in September 2019 that was hosted by the California EPA, Department of Toxic Substances Control and began discussions on preparing a review paper together, which led to the recently published paper in JSD\u200b. CDU\u200b: What is 1,4-dioxane, and what are its current practical applications in personal care and\/or cosmetics products? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b1,4-Dioxane is a polar organic solvent that is used for a few industrial applications, such as serving as a stabilizer for 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other chlorinated solvents. However, it is an irritant and a possible human carcinogen. Its presence in personal care, home care, and cosmetic products, at ppb-to-ppm levels, is therefore unintentional. 1,4-Dioxane is a minor by-product that is formed during the synthesis of sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), a surfactant that is a component of several home care personal care, and cosmetic products, and to a lesser extent in fatty alcohol and fatty acid ethoxylate surfactants. CDU\u200b: What are the most common ways 1,4-dioxane makes its way into ground\/drinking water supplies? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b1,4-Dioxane enters municipal wastewater treatment facilities due to its presence in home and personal care and cosmetic products. Because of its high solubility in water, 1,4-dioxane is difficult to remove by municipal facilities. And its very low concentration in consumer products makes its capture and mitigation in wastewater purification facilities difficult and impractical. In addition, 1,4-dioxane is poorly biodegradable and difficult to break down, which leads to its persistence in water, particularly in groundwater. Most of the 1,4-dioxane pollution that exists occurred decades ago. Surfactant manufacturers have improved their manufacturing processes over the last 20 years to reduce the formation of 1,4-dioxane. CDU\u200b: What types of testing can confirm 1,4-dioxane contamination? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b1,4-Dioxane occurs at ppb-ppm levels in groundwater and waterways, which limits its detection to chromatographic analysis using the same approaches we discuss for home and personal care and cosmetic products in our JSD \u200breview paper. CDU\u200b: What methods or techniques can be used to cleanup contamination? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200bThere is not a robust means to clean up contamination due to 1,4-dioxane. The most significant barriers to mitigation are the low (ppb-ppm) levels of 1,4-dioxane that occur in water and the strong hydrogen bonding network that exists between water and 1,4-dioxane. Several methods are being developed, with Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) being the most promising. AOP involves chemical catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone, photochemical agents, and electrochemical agents. Bioremediation technologies are also under development. CDU\u200b: What are the best ways to reduce exposure to 1,4-dioxane? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b1,4-Dioxane contamination is primarily associated with unintended spills, historical disposal practices, and industrial wastewater have been identified as major sources of 1,4-dioxane contamination in surface water and groundwater that may serve as a source of drinking water. 1,4-Dioxane is also present as a minor impurity of SLES and other ethoxylated surfactants. The best approach to reduce exposure is to reduce the release of 1,4-dioxane to the environment, so that drinking water and food sources do not become contaminated. For consumer products, reducing 1,4-dioxane contamination can be achieved by further improving the performance of catalysts used in the industrial manufacturing of SLES. Another approach is to reformulate personal care, home care, and cosmetic products to minimize the amount of SLES and other ethoxylated surfactants employed. CDU\u200b: Per the study, \u201ca recent report stated that 59% of shampoos and 62% of body cleansers contained 1,4-dioxane levels above 1 ppm.\u201d What are the potential long term health concerns associated with long-term use of these products? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200bThe main route for human exposure remains through contamination of drinking water resulting from the release of contaminated water from municipal facilities and the long term accumulation of 1,4-dioxane in groundwater. Although 1,4-dioxane is an irritant to skin, eyes, and nasal passages, exposure through use of personal care, home care, or cosmetic products presents a minor source of internal exposure due to the low concentration of 1,4-dioxane in these products. The US EPA (2020) has evaluated 8 consumer uses of surface cleaners, laundry\/dishwashing detergents, paint\/floor lacquer, etc. where 1,4-dioxane is present as a byproduct and found no unreasonable risks. The chronic cancer risk was determined for surface cleaners, laundry, and dishwashing products. CDU\u200b: Are there any alternatives to 1,4-dioxane currently in development, or already available for personal care product manufacturers to reformulate? If so, are there increased or decreased costs associated with utilizing alternative solvents in cosmetics\/personal beauty care products? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200bTo reformulate a product so that SLES and other ethoxylate surfactants are replaced or their concentration is minimized, one must realize that there is not a \u201cdrop-in\u201d replacement for these. The most promising approach is to employ surfactant mixtures, such as anionic surfactant \/ nonionic surfactant mixtures, since there can be synergy in surface activity for the surfactant mixtures compared to the neat surfactants. Reformulating products that contain surfactants and numerous other ingredients is quite challenging; but improved models that predictive wetting, coating, and emulsification activity of surfactants and their mixtures has reduced the time and labor required. Replacing SLES with a surfactant mixture may create new problems, such as instability at different temperatures, reduced foaming, differences in consumer perceptions, and the like. Therefore, there are labor and supply costs involved with the research and development of new formulations. The production cost for the new formulation may be higher or lower than the previous formulation, depending on the costs involved with the ingredients and the labor involved with manufacturing. CDU\u200b: Natural personal beauty care products are a current industry trend. Are there any natural alternatives to 1,4-dioxane? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b Surfactant mixtures are promising alternatives to SLES and other ethoxylate surfactants. There are many biobased surfactants (i.e., surfactants whose building blocks are derived from natural resources) that can be used in formulations for surfactant mixtures. Glycolipid biosurfactants, such as sophorolipids or rhamnolipids, possess excellent surface activity and antimicrobial activity and are highly biocompatible and biodegradable. (A biosurfactant is a surfactant obtained directly from nature, particularly from microorganisms.) Similarly, amino acid surfactants serve as a versatile platform of biobased surfactants derived from amino acids and acyl or alkyl group. Amino acid surfactants are excellent emulsifiers, foamers, and antimicrobial agents. Alkyl glucosides are biobased nonionic surfactants commonly used in home and personal care products that have similar emulsification activity as alkyl ethoxylates. Reformulation of products incurs research and development costs and could increase or decrease the cost of the alternative ingredients. Another concern is whether the surfactants described above can be supplied at a rate that will meet demand. CDU\u200b: How are legislators responding regarding regulating, limiting, or eliminating 1,4-dioxane in personal beauty care products? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200b As stated in our recent review paper: \u201cOn January 1, 2022, the New York Legislature enacted amendments to Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) Articles 35 and 37 to establish limits on the amount of 1,4-dioxane that can be present in household cleansing, personal care, and cosmetic products sold or offered for sale in New York State. Specifically, the maximum allowable concentration of 1,4-dioxane for household cleansing and personal care products is 2 ppm (effective December 31, 2022; 1 ppm after December 31, 2023) and for cosmetics is 10 ppm.\u201d The EPA released a Final Risk Evaluation of 1,4- dioxane in 2022. The report found that, although 1,4-dioxane presented a potential health risk for workers involved with the manufacture of 1,4-dioxane, its presence in commercial products did not \u201cpresent an unreasonable health risk.\u201d The EPA determined that additional analysis was necessary prior to risk management phase. The EPA is continuing its research on the impact of 1,4-dioxane on drinking water and environmental justice. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) continues to investigate the ecotoxicity of 1,4-dioxane, particularly its impact on water supply systems and the possible aggregate exposure to humans. The Australian Department of Health has identified cosmetics as presenting a potential risk to consumers of cosmetic products because some cosmetic products tested in Australia possess 1,4-dioxane levels above the 10 ppm threshold level. The same agency raised concerns about worker exposure to 1,4-dioxane, aligned with the 2022 EPA report. Per a survey, Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) proposed a 1 ppm limit for 1,4-dioxane in surfactants CDU\u200b: To your knowledge, have any companies in the personal beauty care space already taken steps to limit or eliminate 1,4-dioxane from their formulations? Stanton\/Hayes: \u200bCompanies that sell personal care products in the State of New York must verify that their products contain at most 2 ppm (1 ppm after December 31, 2023) and at most 10 ppm for cosmetic products hose or show their intention to compliant to these thresholds though the waiver process. These strict requirements require that companies measure 1,4-dioxane concentration in their products and make the necessary adjustment to be compliant.","filter_flag":1}

The risks faced by individuals and businesses continue to become increasingly diverse, leading customers to expect more from risk coverage professionals in the non-life insurance sector. The United Nations developed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now serve as guidelines toward effective action. Utilizing observation satellite data for prompt insurance payments and support for disaster stricken areas in the event of flood damage Invaluable Support for Daily Life Insurance claims are paid when houses are flooded. In the event of a traffic accident, medical expenses are covered when a person is injured together with car repair costs. The traditional perception of non-life insurance companies is that they pay compensation claimed due to disasters and accidents under particular insurance contracts. However, in the case of Tokio Marine Group, the risk coverage provided goes beyond making payouts in times of emergency. The Group works on disaster and accident prevention, along with damage mitigation when catastrophe does strike. The Group is rapidly expanding the range of coverage services it provides for both pre- and post-emergency situations. Tokio Marine launched CORE, a disaster prevention and mitigation consortium that brings together expertise from business operators in diverse fields A program initiated in July 2021 with Central Community Chest of Japan is one example that allows customers to choose paperless, web-based contracts and certificates. Opting in to this system allocates a portion of the money saved through using less resources to be donated to the Red Feather Welfare Fund. Contributions are distributed to local governments to support efforts for disaster prevention, mitigation, and recovery. In other words, Tokio Marine enables customers to choose paperless communication as an option, and money saved through this initiative goes toward enhancing disaster preparedness in local communities while also contributing to decarbonization through the reduction of paper use. The Group also uses satellite data to assist disaster struck areas. These activities are carried out together with a Finnish start-up which makes radar systems able to observe conditions on the ground regardless of the weather or time of day. When the town of Murakami, Niigata, was struck by torrential rain in August 2022, this technology was used to rapidly understand the extent of flooding and quickly pay insuranece claims. These conditions updates were also provided to local support groups via a non-profit organization working to facilitate assistance. The new head office building being constructed in Tokyo's Marunouchi district makes extensive use of wood to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during construction by about 30% In April 2022, the disaster prevention and mitigation consortium CORE launched its complete operations led by Tokio Marine. Seventy-one legal entities make up the membership with participants drawn from a wide range of fields including fluviology, geology, disaster recovery, and community development. The aim is to bring together experts with a diversity of knowledge and know-how from various fields to create new initiatives for disaster prevention and mitigation. Support both prior to and following disasters is not limited to only natural catastrophes. The Group is also working to realize its aim for a society without traffic accidents so that people can enjoy safe, secure mobility and where healthy lifestyles are supported through the early detection of disease and other maladies together with preventing severe cases of medical conditions. Tokio Marine, which has always supported customers in times of need, is pursuing the goal of transforming itself into a presence of constant support for clients everyday in accordance with the SDGs.","filter_flag":1}

The company, which was acquired by online food delivery firm Zomato last year, currently has over 400 dark stores that act as warehouses. \"We have identified several new high-potential neighborhoods in existing as well as new cities. We should start seeing the net dark store number increase going forward,\" Dhindsa said. He further said, \"We are seeking opportunities for store openings in high potential areas based on the data our systems generate, the management bandwidth, and time to supply creation.\" Dhindsa, however, said, unlike the food delivery business, the growth in the quick commerce business is dependent on various factors such as availability of products from the brand, seller ability, and supply chain capacity. \"Only when we feel confident that we can provide a great experience for our customers in a high potential location, do we start the process of opening new stores. Currently, we believe that we can comfortably grow our dark store count by around 30-40 percent over the next 12 months,\" he added. This will also depend on the company's ability to find the best and most cost-effective locations for these stores, Dhindsa said. In the third quarter, he said Blinkit was less impacted compared to the food delivery business as \"our typical purchase basket tends to be more skewed towards essential\/ non-discretionary spends.\" The slight downward pressure on average order value might be a result of the slowdown where customers are preferring to buy smaller packs instead of larger ones, he said, adding, \"Overall however, the last quarter was the highest ever in terms of new and returning customers.\" Blinkit posted a revenue of Rs 301 crore in the third quarter that ended December 31, 2022, up 28 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while gross order value (GOV) stood at Rs 1,749 crore, a growth of 18 percent QoQ. \"All of this growth has come without any expansion in our dark store footprint,\" Dhindsa noted. On advertising income becoming a meaningful source of revenue for Blinkit, he said, \"We expect advertisement revenue to be a significant driver for the increase in revenue per order going forward.\" In line with that vision, he said, \"We launched our new self-serve advertising platform for brands - Blinkit Brand Central, in December 2022. The self-serve platform allows brands to bid on their search keywords of interest, as well as create customized brand stores on the platform.\" Blinkit has become a preferred platform for advertising and engagement for over 500 brands, he said, adding \"these brands, large and emerging, use us to build brand awareness and to also push their sales on the platform with performance advertising.\"","filter_flag":1}
