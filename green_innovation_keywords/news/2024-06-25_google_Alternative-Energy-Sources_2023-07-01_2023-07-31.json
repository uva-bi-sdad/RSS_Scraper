The U.S. Federal government provides funding to advance innovations through thousands of grants, loans, loan guarantees, and cooperative agreements. There currently is more than $350bn in funding through grants and another $400bn in loan authority, which is available for virtually every Technology Readiness Level (TRL). This article lists each of the agencies and their offices, divisions, and departments that provide funding for each of the nine TRLs. Hyperlinks are provided so you can visit the agency websites that list their funding opportunities. A list of current and upcoming grant opportunities, as well as the standing grant and loan guarantee programs for eight federal agencies, which is updated periodically as new grant opportunities become available, can be found on American Diversified Energy\u2019s website under its Find Funding tab. Federal funding opportunities for each TRL Preparation of application for TRL-1 funding: Describe the idea, concept, approach Explain the significance of your idea, concept, approach Identify societal, environmental, or economic needs that will be addressed Lay out the proposed research plan, objectives, methods, tasks, controls, and feasibility, risk, and solution measures Assemble research team Identify milestones and go\/no-go criteria Describe alternatives if the primary approach does not work out This will be your core proposal, which should be adjusted, amplified, and updated at the conclusion of each TRL. The first step: Basic Research Federal funding opportunities: National Science Foundation (NSF) The NSF provides financial support in a wide range of scientific areas, from astronomy to zoology. In addition to funding research in the traditional academic areas, the agency also supports \u201chigh risk, high pay off\u201d ideas, novel collaborations, and projects that may seem like science fiction today but may be commonplace tomorrow. With an annual budget of $11.5bn, NSF makes about 12,000 new grant awards each year, supporting all fields of fundamental science and engineering, including energy innovation and energy efficiency. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) NIFA supports research, educational, and extension efforts in a wide range of scientific fields related to agricultural and behavioural sciences. This includes: Advanced Technologies : bioenergy, biotechnology, nanotechnology : bioenergy, biotechnology, nanotechnology Animals : animal breeding, animal health, animal production, aquaculture : animal breeding, animal health, animal production, aquaculture Business and Economics: markets and trade, natural resource economics, small business, StrikeForce markets and trade, natural resource economics, small business, StrikeForce Education: learning and engagement, minority-serving institutions, workforce development Environment: climate change, ecosystems, invasive pests and diseases Farming and Ranching: agricultural safety, agricultural technology, farmer education, organic agriculture, small and family farms, sustainable agriculture agricultural safety, agricultural technology, farmer education, organic agriculture, small and family farms, sustainable agriculture Food Science: food quality, food safety food quality, food safety International : global food security : global food security Natural Resources: air, forests, grasslands and rangelands, soil, water air, forests, grasslands and rangelands, soil, water Plants: crop production, pest management, plant breeding, plant health crop production, pest management, plant breeding, plant health U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) More than 1,000 grant opportunities are offered each year by the DOD through its various branches of service, medical units, laboratories, research projects, engineering divisions, environmental cleanup and restoration programs, business and inventory management divisions, and energy security initiatives. These include: Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) DARPA\u2019s mission is \u201cto make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies and capabilities for national security.\u201d DARPA has repeatedly delivered on that mission, transforming revolutionary concepts and even seeming impossibilities into practical capabilities. The results have included not only game-changing military capabilities such as precision weapons and stealth technology, but also such icons of modern civilian society such as the Internet, automated voice recognition and language translation, and Global Positioning System receivers small enough to embed in myriad consumer devices. DARPA explicitly reaches for transformational change instead of incremental advances. It is looking for promising technologies within science and engineering research communities. These new designs and technologies have to radically improve military capabilities, offering \u201cstrategies to surprise our adversaries,\u201d with payoffs for non-military uses afterwards (such as the computer, ceramic bearings, and insulators). The DARPA investment has to fundamentally reshape existing fields or create entirely new disciplines and transform these initiatives into profoundly new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security and the commercial and private sectors. Other DOD grant opportunities While DARPA focuses exclusively on transformational and disruptive innovations, there are many other opportunities to propose new ideas, concepts, and approaches to the DOD. The primary criterion the DOD uses in assessing a proposal is: will its development result in a procurement contract from DOD? In other words, once it reaches TRL-9 and is ready for commercialization, will it improve the DOD\u2019s ability to carry out is mission through better technologies, systems, or operational readiness? If so, will DOD buy it? If not, you need to look elsewhere for grants. DOD has set a goal to reduce petroleum use throughout all branches of the military and increase its use of alternative energy sources for all power and fuel consumed by 50 percent within the next five years. Any innovation \u2013 at any TRL \u2013 that will help DOD meet this goal will be of interest to DOD. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Research Program Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided approximately $1.8 billion in R&D funding for more than 660 potentially transformational energy technology projects. ARPA-E funds technology-focused, applied research and development aimed at creating real-world solutions to important problems in energy creation, distribution, and use. ARPA-E issues periodic Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs), which are focused on overcoming specific technical barriers around a specific energy area. ARPA-E also issues periodic OPEN FOAs to identify high-potential projects that address the full range of energy-related technologies, as well as funding solicitations aimed at supporting America\u2019s small business innovators. Office of Science (OS) The Office of Science is the basic scientific research arm of the Department of Energy. It issues a cross-cutting, open solicitation annually that is open year-round. It also issues several FOAs each year focusing on specific research needs that are open to one or more institutions, as well as DOE National Laboratory Announcements that are open only to DOE laboratories.

For example: The 10,000+ grants and $7.5 billion of funding offered each year by NSF focus solely on basic and applied research. The bulk of NFS\u2019s solicitations are targeted to TRLs 1-3, with a smaller number of grants for TRLs-4 and -5. focus solely on basic and applied research. The bulk of NFS\u2019s solicitations are targeted to TRLs 1-3, with a smaller number of grants for TRLs-4 and -5. The $300 million or so in annual grants available from DOE\u2019s Office of Science and ARPA-E , with few exceptions, also focus on basic and applied research and technology development. , with few exceptions, also focus on basic and applied research and technology development. Finally, the $2.5 billion offered each year through the SBIR\/STTR program focus solely on stimulating innovation and moving promising ideas and concepts up through TRL-5. While the SBIR\/STTR program is targeted to ideas and concepts that are initiated with a view toward eventual commercialization, its Phase III stage does not include any additional grant funding: focus solely on stimulating innovation and moving promising ideas and concepts up through TRL-5. While the SBIR\/STTR program is targeted to ideas and concepts that are initiated with a view toward eventual commercialization, its Phase III stage does not include any additional grant funding: Phase III Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) The objective of the SBIR\/STTR Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I\/II R\/R&D activities. The SBIR program does not fund Phase III; instead, the agencies that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program offer multiple grant and incentive funding opportunities through their standing programs and other solicitations to fund further development of the technologies, concepts and approaches that show commercial promise in Phase 1\/II R\/R&D. For some federal agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&D or production contracts for products, processes, or services intended for use by the U.S. government. Most of the agencies that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program, therefore, are potential sources of grants for TRL-6, -7, and -8: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC): National Institute of Standards (NIS) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Follow-on grants for projects funded at earlier TRL stages, as well as grants for projects applying for grants at TRL-6, also are available from: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Other DOD grant opportunities See description of financial support under TRL-1 above U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy (FE) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Office of Energy Delivery and Reliability (OE) and Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Other Federal Government Agencies beyond those listed above and those that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program have grant programs and offer funding that may assist in, or supplement other grants, in carrying out TRL-6. For a list of these agencies, see TRL-7 below. TRL-7 Demonstration-scale testing Federal funding opportunities: See the description of funding opportunities for TRL-6 above. Other funding opportunities may be available if there is a fit with your technology, concept, process, or approach, from: U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) DOC has one overarching goal: Helping the American Economy Grow. The DOC promotes job creation and economic growth, provides the data necessary to support commerce, oversees ocean and coastal navigation, and fosters innovation by setting standards and conducting foundational research and development. Of its nine bureaus, five provide occasional grant and funding opportunities that can assist with moving commerce-related and oceanic- and atmospheric-related technologies, concepts, and approaches through advanced TRLs.

The ITC is earned when the equipment is placed into service. Production Tax Credit (PTC) The PTC reduces federal income taxes on innovative and renewable energy projects based on the electrical output (measured in kilowatt-hours, or kWh) of grid-connected renewable energy facilities. Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS) Or Bonus Depreciation allows businesses and project developers to reduce their federal taxes through a deduction for depreciation when renewable energy equipment or facilities producing renewable energy are placed into service. With the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the first-year depreciation allowance was increased from 50% to 100%. Several other types of technologies and properties that incorporate innovative concepts also are now eligible for MARCS program bonus depreciation. Development is Complete, and commercial Roll-Out Begins Federal funding opportunities: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Business Programs: Business & Industry (B&I) Loan Guarantees Value-Added Producer Grants Rural Development Energy Programs: Advanced Biofuel Payment Program Repowering Assistance Program Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) Loan Guarantees Rural Utility Service (RUS) Electric Programs: Distributed Generation Energy Project Financing Loan Guarantees Electric Infrastructure Loans & Loan Guarantees Rural Utility Service (RUS) Telecommunications Programs: Rural Broadband Loans & Loan Guarantees Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans & Loan Guarantees Rural Utility Service (RUS) Water & Environmental Programs: Water & Waste Disposal Loans and Grants Water & Waste Disposal Loan Guarantees U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Contracting \/ Procurement U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Contracting \/ Procurement U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) Contracting \/ Procurement As well as grant programs to promote job creation and economic development to promote job creation and economic development U.S. Department of Transportation (DOI) Contracting \/ Procurement As well as grant programs for investments in and rebuilding of surface transportation infrastructure and infrastructure enhancements for investments in and rebuilding of surface transportation infrastructure and infrastructure enhancements U.S. Department of the Treasury See descriptions above under TRL-9 of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Production Tax Credit (PTC), and Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS) or Bonus Depreciation Allowance. Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) can be used to finance renewable energy projects using technologies that also qualify for the federal renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). CREBs may be issued by electric cooperatives, government entities (states, cities, counties, territories, Indian tribal governments or any political subdivision thereof), and certain lenders. The bondholder receives federal tax credits in lieu of a portion of the traditional bond interest, resulting in a lower effective interest rate for the borrower. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) may be used by state, local and tribal governments to finance certain types of energy projects. QECBs are qualified tax credit bonds, and in this respect, are similar to Clean Renewable Energy Bonds or CREBs. The difference is that borrower who issues the bond pays back only the principal of the bond, and the bondholder receives federal tax credits in lieu of the traditional bond interest. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) Project Development Grants \/ Loans \/ Loan Guarantees American Diversified Energy has subject matter experts in all disciplines that are required to prepare applications and secure funding to move through each TRL. The Federal Grants page on the American Diversified Energy website serves as a portal to the grants, funding, and support provided by each of the ten federal agencies listed above, with links to each agency\u2019s grant-making programs and lists of current solicitations.","filter_flag":1}
