Better performance than diesel, the T4 Electric Power offers powerful, emission-free and silent energy power with high torque and fast response achieved at the lowest speeds, promoting a new level of driving experience . The pioneering and innovative New Holland tractor is launching for 2024 and will be on display at the 2023 Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois . NEW HOLLAND, Pa., Aug. 28, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ -- The future is here, and it just got more electric. For 2024, New Holland Agriculture is introducing the first all-electric utility tractor with autonomous features: the T4 Electric Power. This cutting-edge tractor opens a new class in the market, the Utility Electric, focused on offering solutions for more efficient field operations. The T4 Electric Power addresses current farming challenges, such as increased total cost ownership and labor shortage, while delivering upon New Holland's unwavering commitment to help customers build more sustainable agriculture for this generation and beyond. The new T4 Electric Power from New Holland is the first all-electric utility tractor with autonomous features. Post this The new T4 Electric Power from New Holland is the first all-electric utility tractor with autonomous features. The T4 Electric Power is a game-changing innovation that ushers in a new era of modern agriculture. An ideal solution for lower horsepower field operations, it is suitable for multiple applications, such as mixed farm, hay and forage, dairy, livestock, municipality, greenhouse and specialty crops (vegetable and orchard). The tractor is the latest development in New Holland's strategic plan for electrification and the newest addition to the brand's lineup of alternative energy sources powered equipments, like the T7 Methane Power LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) and the T6.180 Methane Power. Equipped with a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery pack, the T4 Electric Power delivers gradual power and continuous torque achieved at the lowest speeds, ensuring a completely new driving experience and seamless operation during loader work cycle and daily farm routines. \"This tractor is a significant step forward for growers, producers and municipalities. The T4 Electric Power addresses a number of challenges they are facing everyday on their operations,\" states Lena Bioni, product marketing manager for New Holland Agriculture North America. \"What New Holland is bringing to our farmers is a convergence of technology \u2013 electric propulsion, autonomous features, better performance \u2013 in the body of a utility tractor that's setting the stage for a more efficient, sustainable and resilient future our customers are striving for.\" Performance and Battery Technology Redefined Under the hood of the T4 Electric Power lies a state-of-the-art battery system partnered with a fully electrified drivetrain that's proven to deliver relentless power and productivity. Featuring a 110-kWh maximum energy storage capacity in a 400V nominal high-voltage circuit, it provides 74 hp (55 kW) rated power and 65 hp (48 kW) PTO power. Using an efficient high voltage powertrain with integrated cooling features in the single devices from established mass production vendors, as well as material currently in production, makes this tractor a pioneering and revolutionary solution. Compared to its diesel-powered counterparts, the T4 Electric Power delivers superior performance. It offers 4-wheel drive, a proven 12x12 transmission, clutch-less electronic power shuttle reverser and all the regular power outputs of a traditional diesel utility. This includes rear electro-hydraulic PTO, drawbar, multiple rear remotes, mid-mount valves and a robust, and complete, 725LU mechanical self-leveling front loader with 3rd function and 84'' bucket included. Due to the greater control, enhanced precision and faster responsiveness, the tractor boosts the field capacity by reducing the applications cycle time. The tractor's electrified drivetrain promotes silent power with high torque and fast response achieved at the lowest speeds. These two intrinsic electric motor's characteristics, combined with the 12x12 electronic power shuttle transmission, means that even an inexperienced operator can run the implements during the applications without the need for precise gear selection and throttle control. Meanwhile, experienced operators will have infinite speed adjustments just by controlling motor RPM. Smooth and gradual delivery of power at low speeds and constant delivery in high speeds increase control and precision during field operations. \"The T4 Electric Power's quiet electric motor is definitely a big advantage and important tool in noise sensitive areas,\" Bioni explains. \"Outside, the tractor omits less noise and vibrations compared to diesel ones. Take for example, operating within equestrian barns or on college campuses running mowers and plowing snow alongside dorms.\" The T4 Electric Power was designed by CNH Industrial engineering in the United States (Burr Ridge, Ill., Detroit) and Italy (Modena) with state-of-the-art features and components aimed at durability, long service life and improved uptime. In general, considering light, medium and heavy-duty applications over its daily task routines, it's estimated the tractor can provide 4 hours of average runtime. However, this can easily be extended up to 8 working hours for low energy demand applications. In fact, its extended runtime empowers operators to tackle a variety of jobs without the need for frequent recharging, enhancing even more the overall productivity and reducing operational downtime. The tractor can be recharged by multiple energy sources such as regular grids, solar panels, biodigesters and wind power in both Alternate Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC). Operating in DC, it takes just one hour to reach 100% power when using commercially available fast charging systems. In addition, the T4 Electric Power can provide power availability wherever and whenever a customer needs it. This is the main goal of the practical and convenient Exportable Power feature. Equipped with common 110V and 220V outlets used in workshops and farmyard electrical installations, the tractor can serve as a power source for electric power tools such as welding, drilling and cutting machines. Technology Drives Productivity Smart autonomous features and creative driver assistance modes are part of the T4 Electric Power tractor's innovative character to improve daily farming operations with Precision Solutions & Telematics (PS&T), safety, diagnostics and service. With the design focused on addressing current farming challenges, such as increased total cost ownership, these outstanding features make the T4 Electric Power even more unique in the market. Driver-assisted features \u2013 Follow Me Mode, the Invisible Bucket and 360 Degree Awareness \u2013 are complemented by other fully digital and connected functions like Over the Air Updates, Live View and Map Maker, which make this tractor the first of its kind in the world. The tractor utilizes cameras and sensors in the Smart Roof, while modes are activated via a modern touchscreen display. The result is improved performance and safety both inside and outside of the cab full-time. A Bold New Blue A tractor as innovative as the T4 Electric Power requires its styling to match. The new Clean Blue paint scheme denotes a New Holland tractor that's powered by an alternative fuel source. First debuted on the New Holland T7 Methane Power LNG tractor, this head-turning shade of blue compliments the CNH grey decals, while an all-new hood design sports powerful LED headlights and worklights with illuminated accents. \"You're looking at the style of sustainability. Along with the head-turning paint scheme, customers can expect the T4 Electric Power tractor to redefine operating comfort with in-cab ergonomics, a new digital instrument cluster and a color touchscreen additional display,\" Bioni adds. The T4 Electric Power Tractor Being Introduced at Farm Progress Show The T4 Electric Power tractor will make its public debut at the 2023 Farm Progress Show, August 29-31, 2023, in Decatur, Illinois. It will be on display at the New Holland booth #967 in the northwest quadrant of the show grounds. The tractor is anticipated to be commercially available in North America with select dealers in early 2024.

I\u2019d argue it\u2019s also a good chance to expose your kids to one of the most exciting and diverse displays of agricultural career opportunities they\u2019re likely to find anywhere. Sidle up to anyone wearing an official polo in a tent and ask them what they do. I guarantee they\u2019ll enjoy telling you about it. I started bringing my kids to the show young \u2014 before they were even born! Today, my son is heading off to college and he\u2019s hardly missed a show in all his 18 years. I\u2019d nearly guarantee that the Farm Progress Show is where he nurtured his love of equipment and technology, the exact field he\u2019s pursuing in college. This year is the 70th anniversary of the Farm Progress Show, which began in 1953 on the Earl Buss farm in Armstrong, Ill. And here we are, 70 years later, celebrating agriculture and innovation, at the nation\u2019s largest outdoor farm show. Since 1953, FPS has become the place for new product rollouts \u2014 so much so that in recent years, we\u2019ve convened an editorial New Products Team to fan out across the showgrounds in search of every single new product. We\u2019ll tell you about those new products in upcoming issues of your Farm Progress magazine, as well as online. Related:Step into the Autonomy Zone at FPS As we\u2019ve prepared for this year's show, including publishing the official program, I\u2019ve marveled over every story, every innovation, every plan. It\u2019s clear this industry has emerged from the pandemic with bigger ideas and better products. And even better, you can actually get most of it now! So whether it\u2019s your first show, your seventh or your 70th, don\u2019t be a stranger. Stop by the Farm Progress Show Hospitality Building, located in the center of the exhibit field, get a cool drink and say hello to the editors on hand. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of the magazine, the latest story and the stories you\u2019d like to see us cover. And we look forward to hearing what\u2019s important to you. So to our old friends and those yet to be made, we say welcome back. It\u2019s good to see you again. New technology abounds at this year\u2019s event by Tom J. Bechman The Farm Progress Show was born in 1953 based on history, with an eye toward the present and the future. Prairie Farmer staff were looking for a way to rekindle the spirit of the old corn-husking contests, where thousands of people showed up to watch and visit, while creating a living magazine so advertisers could show off their latest technology. The result was the Farm Progress Show, and the concept is as vibrant today as it was then. The 2023 show builds off agriculture\u2019s rich past, with a nod to those who own red Farmall tractors celebrating 100 years of the Farmall. You can find red tractors in a special display on 12th Street, just west of Central Avenue. Want to see other colors? Check out Antique Row. For everywhere else on the showgrounds, the past gives way to the present and future. Hundreds of exhibitors display their current products for sale. Many have one or more new products in the lineup that didn\u2019t exist at the 2022 Farm Progress Show in Boone, Iowa, which will be the site for the 2024 show. A team of Farm Progress editors will look for those products and publish stories so you can see the ones you missed. Every year, this team finds more than 200 new products. That\u2019s ag technology in overdrive! Some of you come to FPS to check out technology coming soon to market \u2014 and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Autonomous farming, for example, is already here and growing in acceptance. In 2022, one company displayed a working autonomous machine. This year, five companies \u2014 Raven, Sabanto, Greeneye, Ryse and Ag Leader \u2014 will be demonstrating their autonomous machines. Look for them in the Autonomy Zone located near the exhibit field. Electric vehicles were once rare at the show, but they\u2019re becoming more commonplace. Expect to find exhibitors offering everything from electric lawn mowers to all-electric utility tractors and pickups. In the Varied Industries Tent, you\u2019ll likely find information on alternative energy sources. These up-and-coming topics could shape the future of agriculture. Yes, the past, present and future of agriculture are all waiting for you. We hope uncovering details about them makes your visit to the 2023 Farm Progress Show one to remember. The 2023 Farm Progress Show is Aug. 29-31. Learn more at FarmProgressShow.com, and check out the digital edition of the official program.","filter_flag":1}

By implementing sustainable practices, companies can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future while driving innovation and strengthening their brand. Embrace green computing today for a brighter tomorrow! What Is Green Computing? Green computing, sometimes called \u201csustainable IT,\u201d refers to practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint of either individuals or businesses. In today\u2019s modern business climate, green computing is a vital consideration. Achieving \u201cnet zero\u201d (or reducing greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible) has become a priority for most organizations today. Businesses and individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by implementing green computing practices. IBM defines green computing as \u201cthe design, manufacture, use, and disposal of computers, chips, other technology components, and peripherals in a way that limits the harmful impact on the environment, including reducing carbon emissions and the energy consumed by manufacturers, data centers and end-users.\u201d While the main objective of green IT practices is reducing energy consumption, businesses must be aware of how green computing can also increase their bottom line. Organizations, including SMBs, can implement changes to increase energy efficiency and lower energy consumption. However, green computing is ideal for enterprise firms as part of an organization\u2019s overall environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy and journey. Implementing a sustainable strategy can lessen the environmental impact of a business while contributing to overall growth over time. See More: The Impact of ESG Regulations Why Green Computing Is an Essential Part of Sustainability The information and communications technology (ICT) sector is responsible for 2% or more of global greenhouse emissions. According to a study in Patterns, \u201cpeer-reviewed studies estimate ICT\u2019s current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%\u20132.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could be between 2.1% and 3.9%.\u201d The ICT sector\u2019s impact on the environment has worsened in recent years. The rise in cloud computing, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and the explosion of smartphones and other mobile devices contribute to the increase. Data centers are responsible for over 3% of all annual energy consumption. See More: 4 Ways to Ensure Energy Efficiency in Data Centers Key Business Benefits From Green Computing Practices Green computing aims to reduce environmental impact while encouraging the widespread use of more sustainable technologies. Still, there are additional benefits to employing sustainable methods that can lead to steady business growth and profitability. By taking a proactive and achievable approach to sustainable IT, businesses can work toward achieving greater environmental stewardship. Five top benefits of implementing a green IT strategy include the following: Lowering energy costs: Efforts to reduce electricity can lower energy costs for businesses. Changes such as using more energy-efficient devices or alternative energy sources can contribute to lower electricity on a large scale if widely adopted. Gaining a competitive advantage : Pursuing sustainability goals can lead to more profitability and interest from potential investors. A recent Gartner survey Opens a new window revealed ESG is now a top priority for CEOs and CIOs. In contrast, 74% of CEOs agree that increasing ESG efforts will attract more investors expecting firms to do more for the environment. Strengthening your brand: Building a track record of tangible sustainability practices is key to a stronger brand in today\u2019s marketplace. Customers reward sustainable companies with loyalty and repeat business and often prefer ESG-backed products and services. Attracting and retaining talent: Potential employees are interested in working for companies with demonstrated sustainability practices \u2013 especially Gen Z job seekers. A recent KPMG survey Opens a new window revealed that one in three Gen Z respondents \u201csaid they had turned down a job because the company\u2019s ESG commitments were not in line with their values.\u201d Gen Z employees are also willing to leave a company if they don\u2019t follow through with their ESG commitments. Increasing innovation: Green computing practices can drive sustainable innovation, which refers to developing new products, services, processes, and methods that are both sustainable and profitable. Technology organizations can deliver better client experiences that benefit the environment through green computing. Green Computing Techniques for Various IT Functions Green computing techniques can mitigate some of the environmental impacts of the computing industry. These techniques encompass different areas of the IT process and involve several participants. Generally, green IT practices can be applied in the following areas: Design and manufacturing of computer chips, hardware, components, and devices. This includes designing energy-efficient computers and systems. Green disposal of hardware and devices. The implementation of higher efficiency energy practices in the operation of data centers. Employing sustainable practices in computing and software engineering. Some practices are focused on ways to reduce the energy consumption of data centers, such as implementing higher efficiency sustainable cooling technologies. Organizations can also invest in more energy-efficient computer systems with extended life cycles. Other methods for sustainable computing include extending the life cycle of hardware and devices. Edge computing, a type of distributed storage framework, is one technique that can lower energy use in data centers by lowering network traffic. Developers and software engineers can explore various ways to incorporate green computing methods. Green coding, a concept that involves writing leaner and less wasteful lines of code, can reduce the energy consumption of processing. Programming methods can also be modified to utilize devices and the hardware available better. It is important to fully utilize the device\u2019s processing capabilities with clean, native code concepts (embedded NEON, ARM64, and Intel SIMD). This approach can improve the overall collaborative experience while reducing the carbon footprint and delivering more engaging live experiences even on older, less capable devices. Becoming Energy-efficient Energy efficiency can improve overall by utilizing the GPU and CPU. Originating with gaming software development, the GPU approach means that computing is offloaded to the graphics processor unit rather than relying solely on the CPU and main memory. This method lowers the number of cycles needed to complete the processes, thus saving energy. This approach effectively lowers the carbon footprint of devices because they achieve better utilization rates. The potential to reduce the impact of computing on the environment will require a collaborative effort across industries. However, individual businesses can progress by finding ways to use technology sustainably throughout their organization.

In the UK, Brits are paying up to 80 percent more for grocery store essentials, and across the pond, American consumers have seen the largest annual increase in food prices since the 1980s. Everything is going up right now, and we\u2019re sorry to say, chocolate is no exception. In June, the price of cocoa reached a 46-year high, and unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s about to decrease anytime soon. The chocolate price hike is happening for a few reasons, and, as you may find unsurprising, the climate crisis is one of them. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the rising price of chocolate, including whether or not your favorite vegan sweet treat is affected. Why has the price of chocolate increased? According to Time, Russia is partly to blame for rising chocolate prices. This, the magazine notes, is because chocolate manufacturers in Europe (where a significant percentage of the world\u2019s cocoa is imported) placed fewer orders for cocoa last year, due to concerns over energy shortages and price hikes impacting their workers and factories. \u201cBut Europe transitioned relatively easily away from Russia\u2019s fuel, as it found alternative energy sources and as it weathered a relatively warm winter,\u201d Time reports. \u201cBy the time fuel prices started dropping in August of 2022, and chocolate companies realized that they could keep running their factories, they were all competing for a limited supply of cocoa.\u201d But this is only one part of the story. In the last year, chocolate prices have risen by around 25 percent, and that\u2019s partly because of the changing climate. Pexels Most of the world\u2019s cocoa beans are grown in West Africa, where flooding and generally wet conditions have created unfavorable conditions for a decent crop of cocoa. \u201cThe major production regions, particularly in Ivory Coast (also called C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), which accounts for more than 40 percent of global cocoa production, have had very wet conditions and flooding, which has been causing rotting and disease in the trees,\u201d Pia Piggott, an analyst for Rabobank, told the Guardian. While it is the rainy season in the Ivory Coast, the rain has been above average in the region. \u201cIt is not good here, showers come one after the other. Farmers can no longer go to the fields because rivers have broken their banks and there is flooding,\u201d one farmer told Reuters in June. The conditions follow from last year\u2019s period of extreme flooding in West Africa, which, according to experts, was made \u201cabout 80 times more likely\u201d by human-driven climate change. Is vegan chocolate impacted by rising prices? While the vegan milk chocolate market is growing, most dairy-free chocolate options on the market are dark, which is the worst-impacted sector. This is because dark chocolate is usually comprised of more cocoa solids. In fact, some bars can contain up to 90 percent cocoa. \u201cAs a result, the most heavily impacted chocolate price will be dark, which is driven nearly entirely by cocoa ingredient prices,\u201d Andrew Moriarty, the Director of Commodity Insights for Mintec, told NBC News. Ethical problems in the chocolate industry While higher chocolate prices are inconvenient for consumers, it is, of course, cocoa farmers who are suffering the most from the impact of extreme weather. But it\u2019s important to note that this is an industry already rife with issues. According to the Food Empowerment Project, in Ghana, one study found that 23 percent of surveyed cocoa laborers were working without any compensation. It also notes that both adults and children are enslaved in the cocoa industry. It is possible to buy from brands that don\u2019t engage with exploitative practices, however. Beyond Good Chocolate, for example, is based in Brooklyn, but its dark chocolate bars are made at its own factory in Madagascar, with cocoa beans that are purchased for a premium price from local farmers. \u201cOur supply chain is unique,\u201d the brand notes. \u201c[It\u2019s] 100 percent traceable and fully transparent.\u201d Beyond Good The Seattle Chocolate Company is another vegan-friendly brand committed to ethical sourcing from countries like Peru, Ivory Coast, and Ghana. For that reason, these bars are more expensive than the alternatives, and they always have been. But in this case, it is actually worth paying a little extra\u2014the quality is superior, the supply chain isn\u2019t associated with enslavement or child labor, and the people who actually grew the beans will see more of your hard-earned cash. \u201cSeventy-five percent of the people in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire rely on chocolate, or cacao, for their livelihood,\u201d Jean Thompson, CEO of the Seattle Chocolate Company, told Ted back in 2021. \u201cWith today\u2019s chocolate prices, we ensure that they will remain poor forever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to take newfound and widespread respect, understanding, and appreciation of chocolate to elevate cacao and give its farmers the sustainable and prosperous future that they deserve,\u201d she said.","filter_flag":1}

Decarbonization is a crucial global initiative that aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change and transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy. The primary goal of decarbonization is to reduce or eliminate CO 2 emissions and other GHGs associated with human activities. The combustion of fossil fuels\u2014the primary source of carbon emissions\u2014releases significant amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. To effectively combat climate change, it\u2019s crucial to decouple economic growth from GHG emissions, ultimately achieving a carbon-neutral or carbon-negative state. The semiconductor industry contributes substantially to global GHG emissions. Global CO 2 emissions increased by 0.9% in 2020, with 37,000 gigatons of CO 2 emitted, according to reports. The use of renewable energy and the transition to electric vehicles helped avoid 550 million tons of CO 2 emissions, even though the increase in emissions has been less than anticipated. Net\u2013zero GHG emissions Due to the energy needed to produce chips and the specifications of the manufacturing processes, reducing GHG emissions is one of the semiconductor industry\u2019s most difficult tasks. The need to expand the semiconductor ecosystem globally to meet the escalating chip demand adds to this complexity. To achieve net zero, new designs that don\u2019t exist must be found, created and tested. To create a more sustainable computer future, Intel, one of the biggest semiconductor firms in the world, is strengthening its long-standing ecosystem partnership. In April last year, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced Intel\u2019s commitment to reach net-zero emissions across its operations, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2, by 2040. Intel has made major investments in various processes, including chemical substitution, abatement, energy conservation, process enhancement and renewable and alternative energy sources. As a result, Intel\u2019s cumulative GHG emissions over the past 10 years have fallen by more than 80%. Intel is also committed to addressing climate impacts across its upstream and downstream value chain, or Scope 3 emissions. The company\u2019s Scope 3 strategy focuses on forming partnerships with suppliers and customers to implement aggressive measures to reduce overall emissions. Renewable energy transition Shifting from fossil-fuel\u2013based energy sources to renewable energy is a key aspect of decarbonization. Renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal power, generate electricity with minimal or zero GHG emissions. Governments and private entities must invest in developing and deploying renewable energy infrastructures to drive this transition. Intel is increasing its commitment to sustainability by investing in solar- and wind-generated renewable electricity. According to Intel, it exceeded 93% of global renewable electricity consumption by the end of 2022. In addition, the company has collaborated with industry and academic institutions to develop semiconductor-processing alternatives and energy efficiency across the value chain, established standard reporting metrics, increased energy efficiency and decreased the total carbon footprint of products and platforms. Intel has over 110 alternative and renewable electricity installations, with a combined capacity of over 50,000 kW across 22 campuses, which employ distinct technologies, including solar water-heating and -cooling systems, solar electric photovoltaic (PV)-covered parking lots, solar windows, mini bioenergy, motion power, geothermal energy and micro wind turbine array systems. The company is also in collaboration with various business organizations, such as SEMI, the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the Semiconductor Climate Consortium. This newly formed organization brings semiconductor industry suppliers, manufacturers, designers and customers together to accelerate solutions for reducing GHG emissions. The Green Industrial Power division In April 2023, Infineon Technologies renamed its sector that provides power electronics solutions to Green Industrial Power (GIP) to demonstrate its commitment to the decarbonization of its industrial application sectors (see Figure 1). The reason for renaming this sector to GIP is to emphasize the company\u2019s commitment to green-energy transition and to reflect and empower a world where natural energy sources provide limitless energy. Infineon is working in the fields of wind energy and solar power, with its power semiconductors establishing the standard for higher levels of efficiency throughout the entire energy-conversion chain. The concentration on the industrial sector has proved highly successful. It\u2019s anticipated to continue to grow, with the decarbonization of energy supplies and mobility leading to the expansion of renewable energy, grid expansion and charging infrastructures. The transition to non-fossil energy sources must accelerate faster if decarbonization objectives are to be met, according to Infineon. This acceleration is primarily because renewable energy resources have become competitive, making them attractive to invest in and implement, be they PV or wind. Although the initial investment in renewable energy sources is substantial, the long-term cost savings and reduced emissions make it a commercially beneficial investment. Renewable energy storage is a challenge that must be addressed, and the price of electrical storage is decreasing due to technological advancements. Hydrogen is also an option for energy storage with a high energy density, and it can be produced from renewable electricity used in the combustion process, making it a carbon-free energy source. Energy efficiency Improving energy efficiency across various sectors plays a vital role in decarbonization. By reducing energy consumption through efficient technologies and practices, the demand for energy production decreases, leading to a corresponding decline in carbon emissions. Energy-efficient buildings, transportation systems and industrial processes are instrumental in achieving this objective. To completely realize the potential of renewable energy sources, improvements in the efficiency of energy generation, transmission and consumption must occur simultaneously. PV is anticipated to become the world\u2019s primary energy source by 2025 due to anticipated cost reductions. Infineon boasts that 50% of all installed wind farms are powered by their semiconductors, claiming to be the leading semiconductor-enabled enterprise in the field of energy generation. The generated electricity must be efficiently transformed and distributed to all consumers with minimal losses, necessitating energy infrastructure. Infineon views green energy as a sector with double-digit development, which will increase its annual growth opportunities to more than 10%. Compared with the amount of energy consumed by humans, the potential of renewable energy sources like solar and wind is practically limitless. The transition toward green energy and novel materials, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, presents the semiconductor industry with significant challenges and opportunities. The market forecast for 2023 indicates that automation, motors and renewable energy will experience substantial expansion. The future is sustainable, and renaming the industrial division is a step in the right direction. Electrification Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries play a crucial role in the battle against climate change. Li-ion\u2013based technology is widely used in EVs, which require lightweight, high-performance batteries capable of withstanding many charge\/discharge cycles and storing intermittently produced renewable energy. However, the basic materials necessary to produce Li-ion batteries will likely not be sufficient to meet the rising market demand and potential supply issues that could threaten the complete transition to electric mobility. Consequently, alternative technologies must be developed to address the impending paucity of raw materials. Salient Energy, a company founded in 2017 in Waterloo, Canada, has developed a method for producing secure, affordable and environmentally friendly zinc-ion batteries for temporary storage in renewable energy plants. These facilities store pure electricity when it\u2019s abundant and distribute it when required. Zinc is approximately 100\u00d7 more abundant than lithium, and the production of zinc-ion reduces GHG emissions by two-thirds. Salient Energy reduces its reliance on hazardous and high-risk supply chains by utilizing metals mined, processed and manufactured exclusively in North America. To decarbonize the global electricity system to prevent catastrophic climate change, we need a stationary energy-storage industry that utilizes as many batteries as the current EV industry within the next 10 years, according to Salient Energy. Because the EV industry is already causing a deficit in Li-ion raw materials within the market, it can\u2019t serve as a solution. Alternative battery technology is required to supplant Li-ion batteries. The zinc-ion battery manufactured by Salient Energy (see Figure 2) comprises zinc and manganese dioxide sourced from standard commercial sources. These are abundant, inexpensive and non-toxic materials. In addition, the innovative technology is founded on a water-based design that eliminates the risk of fire.

This is according to HERMANN HOLLHUMER, General Manager: Mining at Komatsu South Africa. GERARD PETER reports. Komatsu is the world\u2019s largest producer of electric mining rope shovels, electric dump trucks and a leading producer of electric wheel loaders and support equipment for open-pit mining operations. Its products are used in the mining and processing of coal, copper, iron ore, gold and other minerals and ores. The company has a strong African footprint with its equipment in operation in many tier one mines on the continent. Hollhumer states that Africa is a strategic region for the company. \u201cKomatsu has been in the southern African mining sector for more than 60 years and has now identified other countries for growth such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. As Komatsu South Africa, we play a key role in offering equipment and technical support to the rest of southern Africa.\u201d Komatsu places great emphasis on research and development (R&D) which enables it to build equipment for the future. In fact, the company has technology roadmaps that run until 2040 with a focus on three key areas: sustainability, safety and productivity. Its R&D strategy is very much centred around the needs of the customer. \u201cWe call it \u2018the voice of the customer\u2019 and it is at the centre of our world. Most of our work in GHG reduction and safety is done in collaboration with our customers. \u201cFor example, we host a safety roundtable with our customers to share our ideas and find out what is important to them. The roundtable ensures that we are all on the same page and we know what to prioritise. This helps us to mature our technology and introduce new products into the market,\u201d explains Hollhumer. While there is a strong emphasis on reducing a mine\u2019s carbon footprint, Hollhumer says Komatsu\u2019s number one priority is safety. \u201cAs a case in point, our work in South Africa is currently focused on collision avoidance, something that is very topical in the country at the moment. We are also looking to enhance safety in high-risk activities such as elimination of live work, working at heights and lifting.\u201d Komatsu\u2019s footprint spans far and wide in the global mining sector. However, the company does not take a one size fits all approach when it comes to supplying equipment to different regions. \u201cThere are many different operating environments. For instance, in the Arctic mines operate in extremely cold temperatures while in Africa they operate in warmer climates. As such, we supply equipment based on the environment and customer needs,\u201d says Hollhumer. Currently, models that are used in South Africa include the 730E, a 180-tonne electric dump truck which is used in coal and iron ore mines. In fact, South Africa has the largest fleet of 730s in the world. Another popular model is the 830, a 220-tonne automated dump truck. Electric Dump Trucks lend themselves to the transition of alternative energy sources, albeit from the grid or solar-driven trolley with battery propulsion or hydrogen internal combustion engine or hydrogen fuel cell. The company is also the biggest supplier of rope shovels in southern Africa. Later this year, Komatsu will deliver the world\u2019s largest rope shovel to Mogalakwena platinum mine in Limpopo. In addition, he points out that the company also prefers to supply a number of similar models in a country- to ensure that it can provide spares, maintenance and after-sales support. To this end, Komatsu has 37 branches and depots across the southern African region. Each facility has a spares holding and offers technical support. The company also ensures that its branches and depots are located close to its customers\u2019 operations so that support is readily available. \u201cWe ensure that we evolve with the industry. For example, the smaller diamond miners will operate in an area for up to two years and then relocate. We need to be flexible and open new depots in other areas to provide service that our customers expect,\u201d Hollhumer adds. In addition, Komatsu offers training for both employees and customers at its Johannesburg campus. Along with lecture-based and hands-on training, the company also uses simulators which help to develop troubleshooting capabilities. It also offers online courses and training to customers outside of South Africa. As technology advances, the key question is whether Africa is ready for autonomous or semi-autonomous open-pit equipment. Hollhumer says this is already gaining traction on the continent. He cites mining operations currently making use of autonomous drills in South Africa, with tele- remote hydraulic shovels and track dozers being available for deployment. Autonomous capability is currently being developed for this energy transition that include trolley\/battery driven trucks. \u201cI believe that automation can be successful in Africa. I think that the critical path to delivery is not the technology, it\u2019s about the operational readiness,\u201d he concludes.","filter_flag":1}
