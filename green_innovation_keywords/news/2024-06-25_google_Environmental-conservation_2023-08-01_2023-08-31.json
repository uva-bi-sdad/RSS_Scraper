With people spending most of their time at home, working remotely, and being more cautious in general, the demand for outdoor living increased significantly. My career has revolved around enhancing outdoor living practices. During my time working with Trex, a composite decking company, we developed solutions for effective rain drainage on and under the deck, along with preserving the deck framing. In recent times, people have come to cherish their outdoor spaces, viewing them as essential extensions of their living areas. They also want to make design choices that are sustainable and environmentally responsible. Fortunately, there are now many convenient and budget-friendly options to create a stunning and environmentally responsible backyard. Outdoor Living According to the Outdoor Living Report from Brown Jordan Outdoor Kitchens, a vast majority of Americans said they were interested in updating their outdoor areas. Decks, yards, patios, and porches all ranked high among their preferred outdoor fun and entertainment places. Designing outdoor spaces in a way that respects our environment requires innovation and creativity. How do you construct a sustainable sanctuary outside and appreciate nature \u2013 and make it convenient to use? Sustainable Decks Building a sustainable deck is a good start. Choosing a recycled material, like aluminum or Trex composite decking, reduces the need for raw materials and energy in manufacturing. Trex composite, for example, is made from 95% recycled materials, including plastic and reclaimed wood. It retains its attractive appearance, is durable, and lasts a long time. Trex\u2019s sustainable composite material is also designed to be low-maintenance. In 2021, Trex reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 33% compared to 2020. Trex additionally prioritizes the communities where they operate, helping to collect plastic waste in hundreds of retail locations through one of the largest plastic recycling programs in the country. In 2021, through its NexTrex program, Trex rerouted over 1 million pounds of plastic from landfills. Although some homeowners may choose to use wood, I\u2019m confident that composite decking pays off when you weigh all the ecological factors. If you choose to use wood, look for the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) label. This certifies that the wood has been sourced responsibly with limited impact on natural resources. Check for locally sourced wood from forests near you, if possible, to reduce the emissions associated with shipping lumber thousands of miles. Certain wood types are preferable due to their sustainable sourcing and durability. Woods like ip\u00ea (Brazilian handroanthus) and bamboo are nature-friendly choices, as both last a long time. Bamboo is a renewable resource that grows quickly, which helps minimize its impact on the environment. Natural Water Features Installing water features, such as a solar-powered fountain or a self-sustaining pond, can provide a relaxing atmosphere without excessive electricity usage or adverse environmental impacts. The peaceful sounds of flowing water can be soothing after a long day, especially when they contribute positively to your backyard\u2019s ecosystem. These options also lend themselves to healthier, moisturized air. Planting Ideas Speaking of the air we breathe, incorporating plants can enhance the surroundings of your yard and deck areas. Determine the USDA hardiness zone of your region to help you select plants that will do well where you live. Some plants will thrive in cooler or dryer weather, where others flourish in humidity and lots of sun. Native plants can help support local ecosystems and pollinators. The addition of natural elements like rocks and water features, in addition to being relaxing for you, may make your yard a haven for wildlife. Light It Up! Shining some light on your deck and yard at night shouldn\u2019t be expensive, nor energy intensive. LED lights are easy on the environment, are durable, and last a long time. Soffit lights, which are installed in the area underneath the roof overhang, can create dramatic lighting, but are also perfect for softer hues. Do you need lights in dark places? No problem, these lights can be used like floodlights or to spotlight an unlit corner. If you\u2019re looking for recessed lighting, soffit lights can be installed under the deck. They can even be installed in a pergola. Also, consider illuminating landscape features or a walkway using LED or solar lights. Utilizing lights in conjunction with plants to intensify the visual effect of your yard at night makes for a beautiful and stunning display. Backyard Conservation Sensible stewardship of your outdoor space isn\u2019t just about picking the right materials, it\u2019s also about intelligent design and effective conservation strategies. The story of Trex, and my own journey in manufacturing our products, illustrate how this can be achieved. To begin with, we have always been committed to integrating environmental conservation into our business. Our drive towards sustainability extends beyond the product to how we influence outdoor space management. One example of this is our approach to water conservation. If your yard tends to collect water, we recommend installing a robust drainage system. This protects your deck from water damage, prevents soil erosion, and reduces sediment build-up that could harm local waterways. Notably, it also lessens the chances of a mosquito infestation as well as water-related structural issues. Take a holistic view of outdoor space management and consider getting professional input. We encourage homeowners to consult design professionals who can assess your landscape and recommend solutions tailored to your unique situation. The solutions might include installing a French drain system, creating a rain garden, or other context-specific interventions. We are ardent advocates for using water wisely. Our approach emphasizes strategies that reduce water usage and promote sustainability. For instance, we encourage homeowners to collect rainwater to hydrate their plants, select drought-resistant plants, and even let their grass go dormant when necessary. From my personal experience in construction, I believe that responsible stewardship of our outdoor spaces should not be an afterthought but a guiding principle. As such, we aim to design products that not only respect the environment but also help homeowners reduce their environmental impact. Design for the Environment While there are many solutions we can make use of for building a healthy ecosystem in our yards and on our decks, it\u2019s important that we consider all the things that we do, both good and bad. Though we don\u2019t mean to, some activities we partake in can be detrimental to the earth. With a little effort there are ways to counter or reduce negative impacts, and to swing the effects in nature\u2019s favor. When keeping sustainability in focus, there are several things you can do to ensure your backyard or deck is harmonious with the environment. Build with ecologically beneficial material. Certain woods are more environmentally friendly than others. Composite decking, like Trex, is also a prime example of an ecologically responsible material. Take advantage of nature\u2019s bounties. Use the shade from your trees or the sun\u2019s natural path to help plan your patio \u2013 or to plant your garden. Finally, consider refurbishing furniture or utilize sustainable d\u00e9cor for your deck. Remember, the key is to reduce your carbon footprint by recycling, repurposing, and reusing whenever possible.

As the country forges towards managing solid waste disposal, the local community in the sprawling Bondeni slums is steps ahead in the recycling business and is turning discarded plastic bottles and used car tyres into a fortune. They have also gone a notch higher in redefining the narrative about environmental conservation by manufacturing briquettes from a blend of charcoal dust and cow dung as one way of reducing reliance on firewood thus reducing destruction of forests. By recycling junk, the Bondeni community under the umbrella Mazingira Network which brings together more than 10 environmental conservation lobbies is promoting a recycling culture that can help address the county\u2019s waste management challenges. Mazingira Network has been promoting recycling of non-biodegradable waste not only for creating a clean and safe environment but also improving economic well-being of the slum\u2019s dwellers. Twenty-Eight -year old Consalata Wanjohi says while most people consider discarded plastic bottles as rubbish and disgusting, her environment conservation group sees it as raw material for pure art. Wanjohi, a member of \u2018Bidii Yangu Environment Conservation Group\u2019 is giving life to used plastics as a way of reducing their pollution, dumping and burning. She works with 17 women, mostly in her veranda at home, treading the plastic bottles into fashionable colorful laundry baskets, flower vases, shoe racks, shopping baskets and utensil racks among others. Wanjohi prefers to call her creative process \u2018up cycling\u2019 when she transforms plastic bottles into incredible and artistic products. \u201cWe came together as a team to clean up our estate by collecting garbage. We are promoting the notion particularly among women and youth groups that plastic can be recycled and transformed into better quality products with environmental value,\u201d adds Wanjohi. Together with her team, they collect plastic bottles from local businesses and waste centres, clean and separate them. They also retrieve the bottles from waterways. They then sort them according to colour and size after the cleaning process before proceeding to make entirely new products. \u2018Bidii Yangu Environment Conservation Group\u2019s\u2019 work highlights the importance of finding solutions to combat plastic pollution. Today, more than 400 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced globally every year, half of which is designed to be used only once (single-use). This plastic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose and often ends up in the oceans and waterways, endangering marine ecosystems and ultimately harming human health. However, Wanjohi says it has been a bumpy journey for them because they get a lot of negative energy from their friends and community, but this has not numbed their high spirit. They also grapple with lack of funding to expand their operation and conduct more research on recycling waste. \u201cOur dream is to inspire as many women as possible. We want to let women know that one doesn\u2019t need to rely on a white-collar job, but you can create your job. Always look for opportunities and be your boss,\u201d she enthuses. The group doesn\u2019t have a specific target clientele. Their product prices range from Ksh 500 to 6, 000. What are some of the advantages of using their products? She says they are durable and affordable, and can be used both indoors and outdoors. She reveals that the future looks bright because a new global shift is championing sustainability goals through using recycled materials and making products more recyclable. Also, people are becoming more eco-conscious with whatever they are buying. For the competition, the group believes there is a market for every piece. Because of this, they are willing to train as many women as possible for free. And to ensure that they remain relevant in the industry the groups rely hugely on research. To them, research has helped them come up with trendier items that are giving their venture a business sense. \u2018Bidii Yangu Environment Conservation Group\u2019 is also pioneering turning plastic bottles into materials for landscaping, building homes and constructing perimeter walls. Martin Mwanthi for instance, the Secretary of the group, now owns a homestead surrounded by a perimeter wall made of stacked plastic bottles. He says that building structures with waste plastic cut the costs by about 40 percent. Mwanthi explains that constructing houses using plastic bottles reduces the need for other building materials, particularly sand and concrete blocks. The group is also involved in recycling tyres sourced from garages, incinerators, and individuals, as well as those dumped by the roadside. Once collected, these tyres are scrubbed free of grit and oil, followed by a rinse. These clean tyres are subsequently drilled in preparation for the final furnishings. From there, the entrepreneurs create \u201cartsy and ultra-modern\u201d planters, flower pots, sandals among others, which happen to be sustainable and earth-friendly. \u201cJust as people plant vegetables in sacks, old tyres can also be recycled and used to plant kales, onions or crops that do not have tubers due to limited space,\u201d Mwanthi states. While noting that the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) registers 7,000 vehicles monthly and 90,000 every year, he observes that as the number of vehicles on Kenyan roads continues to rise, the problem of scrap tyre disposal presents serious waste management challenges for society. \u201cThis is because an average motor vehicle will go through several sets of tyres in its lifetime,\u201dhe argues. \u201cFinding creative ways to give old tyres a second life is an important conservation effort. We would like to urge Kenyans to stop burning tyres, especially since most people think the best way to dispose of scrap tyres is to burn them or throw them in dump sites. This, unfortunately, creates an environmental strain,\u201d says Mwanthi. It is estimated that in Kenya, about 34,000 tonnes of waste tyres have been burnt haphazardly, dumped, destroyed or re-used by methods that pollute the air, soils, and groundwater since 2010. At Fanaka Bondeni Environmental Conservation Group its chairperson Mwanaisha Cheptoo offers that she and her 12 colleagues are actively propagating environmental conservation among their peers to encourage \u2018value addition\u2019 to discarded charcoal waste and cow dung. The entire yard at the group\u2019s workshop is a striking spectacle lined with bags of charcoal dust, and manure just waiting to be turned into finished products. Cheptoo explains that before venturing into the business three years ago, Fanaka Bondeni Environmental Conservation Group found out that residents complained of eyes and respiratory diseases, especially among children and women, caused by smoky kitchens. \u201cWe knew residents needed urgent intervention on clean fuel that could reduce the costs and also respiratory diseases,\u201d she says. That gave them an idea of clean and affordable cooking solutions. Together they resolved to venture into safer and cheaper carbonized charcoal briquettes. The group briefly researched how to produce charcoal briquettes and discovered the formula. In less than a month, they had produced briquettes which were ready for sale and use. Residents rushed for the briquettes because they were cheaper. \u201cWe sold at Ksh30, unlike the firewood that cost Ksh 100 or ordinary charcoal for Ksh 80 a tin,\u201d recalls Cheptoo. Despite being cheap, the business took longer to pick as it required demonstrations \u2013 many residents had never used briquettes before. Along the way, more customers trooped in, mostly through referrals and from their social media platforms. Meanwhile, as their customer base grew, they started facing challenges in production. Living and working in a rented premises, Cheptoo recalls, came with the challenge of getting a place to dry their briquettes as demand grew. \u201cWe want to invest in a machine that can produce already dried briquettes, to save us time of drying,\u201d she reveals. The process starts with collecting charcoal wastes from charcoal vendors and cow dung from farmers. These are mixed with water and moulded into briquettes. This as the Government is banking on promoting entrepreneurship in waste management and enhanced enforcement to end the perennial garbage problem in the country. Cabinet Secretary in charge of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry Soipan Tuya says promotion of waste recycling and reuse has become a more practical approach to solid waste management adding that with the increasing cost of raw materials, recycling provides a cheaper source for manufacturing industries. The Government, she says, is working with devolved units to provide an enabling environment for investments in recycling as business ventures and is encouraging industry operators to set up recycling schemes for wastes including aluminum cans, bottles, and polythene materials to improve environmental conditions while also generating incomes to the poor. She went on: \u201cWe need innovative technologies and approaches that change the way we think about, use and treat solid, liquid, domestic, industrial and commercial waste. Cities need to explore the 5Rs of Rethinking, Refusing, Reducing, Reusing and Recycling and opportunities that transform waste to wealth.\u201d Nakuru Governor Susan Kihika says the county\u2019s population is growing at a rate of between 7 to 8 percent per year, which translated into increased solid waste. An average of 45 per cent of waste goes uncollected in six major towns across the country, according to an official report by the National Environmental Complaints Committee. Nairobi, Kisumu, Thika, Nakuru, Mombasa and Eldoret towns generate an estimated 6,000 tonnes of waste daily. However, only 3,962 tonnes are collected while over 2,000 tonnes remain uncollected. According to the report, Mombasa tops the list with 770 tonnes of uncollected waste although 65 per cent of the 2,200 tonnes of generated waste is collected daily. Kisumu County leads in those with the least effort being made to collect daily generated garbage. Only 20 per cent is collected, according to the report, leaving 80 tonnes uncollected. Nairobi tops the list in active waste collection \u2013 80 per cent of the daily generated garbage is collected. However, 240 tonnes of waste still goes uncollected. Other towns including Eldoret leave behind 270 tonnes daily while Thika and Nakuru leave 60 and 138 tons respectively. Kihika says her administration has entered into collaborations with other stakeholders to ensure that any valuable waste does not find its way to the dumpsite. For the dumpsite combers and waste pickers like Cheptoo, Mwanthi and Wanjohi, it takes the contribution of all to make the desired difference.","filter_flag":1}

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}
