Delivered and installed by Centrica Business Solutions, the new unit uses natural gas to generate electricity and hot water at the site, with its exhaust gases also used to feed into a heat recovery generator to provide steam. It means CHP technology is over twice as efficient as conventional power sources. It is the latest in a series of measures Moy Park is taking to improve energy efficiency and meet its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its operations by 2040. Alongside investment in emissions reduction projects in Moy Park owned facilities, the company is investing in research and development projects to strengthen and scale regenerative farming practices and is committed to reducing water use intensity by 15 per cent by 2030 and have 100 per cent renewable energy across the business by 2025. Moy Park general manager Nompilo Sibanda said: \u201cWe have a responsibility to produce quality food in the most sustainable way and to reduce our impact on the environment. \u201cThis responsibility is something we take very seriously, and across business we are taking action to make our processes more energy efficient and sustainable. \u201cThe investment at Craigavon will ensure energy savings, and we are grateful to the team at Centrica for their partnership and collaboration in delivering this project.\u201d She added: \u201cOur journey to net zero emissions by 2040 is ongoing and this is just one of many investments we are making to reach our sustainability goals. We are collaborating closely with partners to ensure our processes across the business and across the supply chain are more sustainable and bring us closer to our net zero target.\u201d Justin Jacober, director of Centrica Business Solutions UK & Ireland, said: \u201cCHP isn\u2019t just an energy-efficient solution; it\u2019s also a smart one. It allows businesses like Moy Park to produce heat and power from the same fuel, delivering cost savings, environmental benefits and energy security, all in one package. \u201cWith net zero commitments driving change across Moy Park\u2019s operations, the new unit is a milestone on its journey to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. And, with the food and drink industry facing challenges from increased production costs and supply chain issues, improved energy efficiency is more important than ever.\u201d Centrica Business Solutions has provided a consolidated full wrap package for the company, acting as investor, manufacturer, installer, and service provider that guarantees performance for the life of the system.","filter_flag":1}
