Industry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute state-level laws that prevent bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags. Over a dozen states currently have preemptive laws on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics, though some of the same states are also trying to pass anti-preemption laws. Fundamentally, to solve the plastic pollution crisis, society must address the root problem: plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap. One way to improve recycling\u2014and prevent unwanted health effects and environmental problems\u2014would be to simplify and standardize the process of plastic production, Walker-Franklin says. Currently, more than 10,000 chemicals are used in the production of plastics, and upward of 3,200 have \u201cone or more hazardous properties of concern,\u201d with the potential to harm humans and wildlife, according to UNEP. Very little or nothing is known about the health effects or basic properties of thousands more. Another way to improve recycling would be to find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials instead of having to sort everything first. One promising technique, described in an October 2020 study coauthored by Julie Rorrer, then a researcher at MIT, can process polypropylene and polyethylene into propane. Another process, described in a study published in Science the same month, can break down mixtures of common consumer plastics and re-form them into a bioplastic, in part by using an engineered soil bacterium. Others dream of a day when microbes could be used to recycle or clean up all this waste. One French biotechnology company, Carbios, opened a pilot plant in September 2021 to break down and recycle PET using an engineered form of an enzyme first discovered in compost; it\u2019s currently building a full-scale facility due to open in 2025. In theory, this type of recycling could be truly circular, as it wouldn\u2019t require the high heat that normally causes much of the degradation seen with recycled plastics. A microbe discovered in Japan in 2016, called Ideonella sakaiensis, produces two other enzymes that can break down PET. This microbe is especially intriguing because it is the first one identified that can live solely upon plastic as a food source. MIT researcher Linda Zhong-Johnson is working to create more efficient versions of the enzymes by tinkering with microbial genes. So far, one mutation she has identified creates an enzyme that appears to be up to 30% more efficient than its original wild form. Reducing demand Fundamentally, to solve the plastic pollution crisis, society must address the root problem: plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap because polymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require policy and behavioral changes small and large. As an example of the former, policymakers in Washington, DC, instituted a five-cent charge on plastic bags that began in 2010. Estimates suggest that the number of bags used quickly dropped\u2014by more than half in the months after it was instituted\u2014and the quantity found in local waterways dropped between 30% and 70% thereafter. Seemingly tiny changes like this can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution. Meanwhile, a global EPR scheme would be an example of a major shift, and the UN process is seeking other big changes to the status quo. Of course, such changes will be difficult, but they can be instituted in gradual ways that don\u2019t hurt businesses, Boachie says: \u201cMy hope emanates from the fact that what we are talking about is not something that will impede the growth and success of any company.\u201d On the contrary, he adds, creating incentives for alternatives will spur innovation and create new jobs. A lot of such innovation will doubtless be needed to reverse situations like what I saw in the Connecticut salt marsh. At one point we came upon a couple of osprey nests from which plastic strands billowed, unwittingly collected by the birds as they built their nests. Later, we found a vinyl firehose lodged intractably in the muck between oysters. I couldn\u2019t pull it out, nor could I cut into it with a small pocketknife. We reluctantly left it behind.

It offers better information than the alternatives, and it\u2019s growing. Yet in that time, recycling rates haven\u2019t dramatically risen; many activists believe that recycling, especially for plastics, will never work; and other labels continue to confuse consumers and hamper recycling. In this challenging context, what\u2019s it like to swim upstream? To find out, I sat down with Karen Hagerman, director of the How2Recycle program. The nonprofit GreenBlue originally rolled out How2Recycle (H2R) in 2012 \"to get more materials in the recycling bin by taking the guesswork out of recycling.\" Other than \"a couple of one-offs,\" no other nationwide system for labeling recyclable materials exists either in the U.S. or Canada, she said. After more than a decade, the H2R label has grown from a pilot program to one with over 500 brand members including Coca-Cola, Clorox and General Mills, an additional 100 packaging manufacturers or non-brand members and tens of thousands of labels on packaging in the U.S. and Canada. The improved information How2Recycle has done a great job of developing a more detailed and helpful label for recyclability because, as the example below shows, it breaks down a package by component \u2014 such as paper box or plastic tray \u2014 with specific instructions for each. An example of a How2Recycle label for multi-component packaging. Credit: how2recycle.info It offers more and better information than non-standardized labels, such as the widespread chasing arrows symbol, which lacks the details to help you decide where to put a container \u2014 especially because the acceptance of certain materials, such as polypropylene, varies by region, ZIP code and in some cases, which hauler services your address. The policy discussion \"One really hot topic with the How2Recycle label, our membership and just recyclability in general is all the movement on policy to regulate recyclability messaging,\" she said, referring to California\u2019s S.B. 343 truth in labeling law coming into effect in 2024. \"It's really challenging because as we see that occur, (we\u2019re) operating at a national scale, so figuring out how to adapt to the different states while still communicating to a national market is complex.\" Backing up, How2Recycle is founded on both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Green Guides and the Canadian Competition Bureau\u2019s Environmental Claims and Greenwashing guidance. Hagerman described how H2R\u2019s recyclability claims are based on five pillars: Compliance with applicable law Recycling access for the specific material for at least 60 percent of households, a threshold outlined in the Green Guides Technical sortation of materials Re-processability of the material The existence of an end market for the material The challenging environment To offer context for the environment in which the H2R label operates, I looked at the EPA\u2019s most recent data about recycling rates, which is five years old. Recycling rates for packaging overall have risen from 38 percent to 54 percent between 2000 and 2018. But plastics recycling has barely budged, from 9 percent to 14 percent; it has remained at 14 percent between 2010 and 2018. Aluminum recycling, meanwhile, has fallen from 44 percent to 35 percent. It doesn't seem like we're moving the needle at all. Why not? As for these trends, according to Hagerman, even where materials are collected and sorted, the data about what recycled raw material feeds back into new products is tough to come by. U.S. recycling rates, 2000-2018, based on EPA data. In addition, the privatized system in the U.S. for collection, sorting and recycling leaves gaps. \"The data exists,\" Hagerman said, \"but it exists in such a fragmented way.\" \"I mean, I would love data on the effectiveness of the How2Recycle label,\" she added. \"I would love to do bale audits and see: Does our label sort correctly? Are consumers actually following the instructions? Is material making it to the right place? What percentage of the cardboard bale has the How2Recycle label on it? \"Those are things we're looking into and we're trying to increase our capacity and resources to be able to get that data, because at the end of the day I want to be able to tell businesses and consumers that yes, this label is effective at increasing the quality and quantity in the recycling system. That's our mission.\" My takeaway is that you can only improve what you measure, and in the case of recycling, we are not doing a great job of measuring. What can we learn from all this? Recycling is a systems issue. We can improve packaging design, labeling, collection and recycling infrastructure independently, but without linking them all together and creating end markets, it\u2019ll be difficult to make headway.","filter_flag":1}

In exchange for their commitment, PSC will provide informational tools, including: A marketplace of vetted, pre-qualified packaging suppliers Methods of measuring packaging life cycles Packaging design guides and labeling support from How2Recycle Legislative updates from North America and the European Union on sustainable packaging Marketing assets, including badges and social media promotion opportunities \u201cIn exchange for their commitment, PSC is providing signatories with tools such as packaging benchmarking tools, North American and EU legislative briefs, a marketplace of pre-vetted packaging suppliers, communication assets, project support, and more,\u201d said Caitlyn Dudas, executive director of the PSC, Boulder, Colo. \u201cThe PSC Packaging Pledge represents a powerful opportunity for us to collaborate in significantly reducing the industry\u2019s impact on the environment. We are proud to spearhead this initiative and help drive more sustainable and successful business.\u201d The positive impact of change The use of recyclable packaging offers many benefits, including reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. In addition, the production of recyclable packaging often requires less energy and water, and creates fewer greenhouse gas emissions than non-recyclable packaging. \u201cThe greatest benefit of using recyclable packaging is reducing the impact we as an industry have on the environment,\u201d said Dave McCoy, director of strategic sourcing, Instinct Pet Food, St. Louis, Mo. \u201cBy utilizing recyclable packaging, we\u2019re moving material away from landfills and into recyclable streams that can use those bags to make other products.\u201d \u201cThere are additional significant benefits that consumers may not realize, that are reaped before the kibble even hits the bag,\u201d added Christine Mallier, sustainability and community relations manager, Petcurean, Chilliwack, British Columbia. \u201cFrom the sourcing of the material and manufacturing to the transporting of the bags, there are reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, water use, mineral resource use, human impact and freshwater ecotoxicity.\u201d During SuperZoo 2022, five pet food manufacturers \u2014 Canidae, Earth Animal, Instinct, Petcurean and Primal Pet Foods \u2014 publicly signed the PSC\u2019s Packaging Pledge, making a commitment toward using more refillable, compostable and recyclable packaging through 2025. (Source: Sosland Publishing Co.) More and more consumers are becoming concerned about the environment and are choosing brands that are making an effort to be sustainable. By using recyclable packaging, pet food companies can show their commitment to sustainability and attract more environmentally conscious consumers. Committing to sustainability could also help companies attract and retain talent. \u201cWe are seeing more and more consumers increasingly prioritize the purchasing decisions around the environment and choosing to support brands that share their values,\u201d Mallier said. \u201cAnd, as more Gen Z\u2019s start to enter the workforce in the coming years, we know that they will also seek out employers that share similar values. As such, companies with strong sustainability practices \u2014 like those that use recyclable packaging \u2014 will likely see an advantage when it comes to attracting and retaining employees.\u201d Sustainable packaging solutions Pet food and treat manufacturers have a variety of recyclable packaging materials to choose from. The choice of material depends on a number of factors, including the type of product being packaged, transportation and storage considerations, safety standards and cost. \u201cAs we transition to more sustainable packaging across our Primal Pet Foods line, we don\u2019t take a one-size-fits-all approach,\u201d said Megan Pearson, director of major and strategic accounts and sustainability committee lead, Primal Pet Foods, Fairfield, Calif. \u201cWe work with our packaging suppliers to evaluate the different recyclable materials available and determine which is best suited for each product based on several factors. In addition to protecting our food and treats while they are being transported and handled, our packaging materials need to be able to maintain our high standards for quality and safety.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing more and more consumers increasingly prioritize the purchasing decisions around the environment and choosing to support brands that share their values,\u201d said Christine Mallier of Petcurean. Single-layer polyethylene is one of the most widely used types of recyclable packaging for pet food and treats. It offers a number of benefits, including being lightweight, strong and moisture resistant. The single-layer construction also makes it easy to recycle, unlike multi-layer materials. \u201cTraditional flexible packaging consists of a multilayered structure with materials like polyester and polyethylene\u2026 Recycling centers are unable to separate the different films, thus rendering them unrecyclable,\u201d McCoy explained. \u201cThe packaging and pet food industry is moving toward more sustainable, single (mono) structure bags made of polyethylene that are recyclable through store drop-off sites.\u201d \u201cThe companion pet industry creates more than 300 million lbs of flexible plastic packaging in North America each year,\u201d Dudas added. \u201cUnfortunately, 99% of multi-laminate packaging used for most pet food and treats does not have a sustainable end-of-life solution and ends up in landfills. Our Packaging Pledge supports brands and suppliers as they commit to making measurable progress towards refillable, compostable and\/or recyclable packaging solutions by the end of 2025.\u201d Thanh Phu Plastic Packaging Co., Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, is one company that has made a commitment to sustainable packaging solutions. As a founding donor of the Packaging Pledge and recognized pioneer in developing sustainable flexible packaging, Thanh Phu has been working to create more eco-friendly packaging for the pet food industry. \u201cPet food packaging, especially for kibble, requires high-impact strength, large format pouches up to 20 kgs,\u201d said Alex Dam, executive vice president, Thanh Phu Plastic Packaging Co. \u201cIn addition, some pet food and treats contain high protein and fat content, requiring a hermetic seal with a good oxygen and moisture barrier. Our Veloflex\u2122 Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) solution provides outstanding heat sealability and impact strength for a large temperature range from sub-zero to normal warehouse temperatures. Additionally, PE resin is abundantly available with good economies of scale to meet the transition from non-recyclable to fully recyclable mono-polyethylene packaging.\u201d Overcoming challenges The many benefits of using recyclable packaging materials also come with some challenges. These include the properties of the materials themselves, the infrastructure needed to recycle them, and consumer education to ensure that packaging is properly recycled. \u201cRecyclable bags have historically not been as strong and durable as non-recyclable bags,\u201d said Dave McCoy of Instinct Pet Food. One challenge is finding recyclable materials that meet the performance requirements of pet food packaging. Although there has been a lot of progress in this area, it can take time for new materials to be fully tested and approved for use. Additionally, the availability of certain materials can be limited, which can impact cost. \u201cRecyclable bags have historically not been as strong and durable as non-recyclable bags,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cTechnology and films are improving in such a way where that gap in performance is shrinking, but oftentimes, there is a learning curve to implement... In addition, some recyclable material is simply not as readily available as its non-recyclable counterparts. That will change over time as more brands and suppliers increase their sustainability efforts and move to recyclable films. In the near term, proper forecasting and planning are needed to ensure access to material.\u201d In terms of infrastructure, not all areas have the necessary facilities to process recyclable materials. This can make it difficult to ensure that packaging is properly recycled and does not end up in landfills. However, drop-off recycling centers are becoming more common, which makes it easier for consumers to recycle their packaging. Finally, many consumers are not aware of the importance of recycling or how to properly recycle their packaging. This can lead to packaging being thrown in the trash instead of being recycled. Pet food brands will need to continue to educate consumers on the importance of recycling and how to do it successfully. \u201cOne of the key challenges of using recyclable packaging in the pet food industry is that this type of packaging needs to be properly recycled at recycle depots or store drop-off locations to reap the full benefits of it,\u201d Mallier said. \u201cThis is a challenge which requires a change in consumer behavior. With that said, it\u2019s up to brands to help overcome this challenge through education \u2014 to retailers and consumers directly \u2014 and through their various marketing channels, like social media.\u201d The evolving role As the pet food industry continues to evolve, the role of recyclable packaging will also change. More and more brands are likely to switch to recyclable packaging as they look for ways to reduce their environmental impact, and new technologies and materials will continue to emerge. \u201cThe near-term trend is moving toward recyclable bags, but there are many exciting possibilities for the future, including packaging that is compostable, biodegradable or refillable,\u2019\u2019 McCoy said. \u201cAs more brands incorporate these emerging, sustainable options into their portfolios, the more widely available they will become for the industry as a whole.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about progress, not perfection,\u201d Pearson added. \u201cWe are committed to transitioning to more sustainable packaging across our Primal Pet Foods line over the next few years. As our industry makes this commitment, we expect to see an evolution in the recyclable materials and formats that are being used.\u201d Although there is still a long way to go, initiatives like the PSC\u2019s Packaging Pledge are helping to move the industry in the right direction. As more brands commit to using recyclable packaging, the availability of these materials will increase and the challenge of recycling will become easier to overcome. Through a combination of efforts, the pet food industry will be able to make significant progress in reducing its environmental impact. \u201cFlexible plastic packaging can help prevent food waste throughout the supply chain from farm to table, with the lowest carbon footprint, compared with existing alternatives such as glass, metals and fiber,\u201d Dam said. \u201cIn the new era of environmental conscience, the drawback of lightweight non-recyclable packaging becomes more significant and needs to be addressed.\u201d Read more about packaging solutions and trends for pet food and treats.","filter_flag":1}

Recycle week is calling on children aged 5 to 11 in Leeds to take the lead in protecting our planet. With a week of fun activities, the campaign wants to empower young people to become active participants in building a sustainable future. For example, Richmond Hill Academy pupils will be making items from recyclable materials, performing a poem about recycling and designing recycling-themed posters during recycle week. To launch the week, The Lord Mayor of Leeds, Councillor Al Garthwaite visited HW Martin\u2019s materials recycling facility (MRF) in Beeston on Monday (16 October). The MRF processes the contents from Leeds residents\u2019 green bins, using a mix of state-of-the-art sorting technology and people sifting the recyclable materials ready to be turned into new products. The Lord Mayor found out more about the range of paper, cardboard, plastic and metal items that can be recycled and the importance of getting the right thing in the right bin. The big recycling hunt, the central theme of this year's campaign, promises to shine a bright spotlight on missed capture. This nationwide hunt aims to engage children and families in the quest to find 'lost recyclables' that too often find their way into the rubbish bin. By focusing on commonly missed items such as empty aerosols, plastic cleaning product bottles, plastic toiletry bottles, plastic pots and tubs, and food tins, Recycle Now wants to foster a deeper understanding of recycling in the younger generation. In Leeds, recycle week is also being marked across the city, with some of the city\u2019s iconic landmarks being lit up in green, if you spot one why not share a picture on social media using #RecycleWeek. Councillor Mohammed Rafique, Leeds City Council\u2019s executive member for climate, energy, environment and green space, said, \u201cAs a city, we can all make a real difference to the environment if we ensure we understand which paper, cardboard, metal and plastic items can be put in our green recycling bins \u2013 it could surprise you how much you can actually recycle. \u201cIt is fantastic to hear about all the young people getting involved across Leeds and I am certain that our recycling future is safe in their reliable hands.\u201d Harriet Lamb, Chief Executive of WRAP, said, \u201cThe importance of this initiative extends beyond recycle week. By empowering children with the knowledge and tools to become recycling advocates, we are not only nurturing the future but also ensuring a healthier and more sustainable world for all. Join us in celebrating recycle week and empowering the next generation of environmental champions.\u201d Recycling doesn\u2019t have to be confusing.

However, the fully glazed building is more than just a place to apply for ID cards or register change of address. The new town hall stands for transparency and democracy and wants to be a modern and customer-driven facility. Its Welcome Home slogan is an invitation to associations and students to use the public spaces to convene, study and hold meetings. The city council\u2019s new plenary chamber is the building\u2019s centrepiece. The chamber\u2019s interior with Wilkhahn seating and tables marries democratic principles with a minimalist design. The vast building with a floorspace of 37,000 square metres has an impressive glass facade that stands for transparency. Above all, this facility is the new workplace for around 1,700 employees of Brussels city council. Striking glass cylinders that house the elevators run through the building. A public restaurant and a spectacular rooftop patio with a panoramic view of Brussels city centre are located on the two top storeys. The building was designed by Belgian architectural firm Bruno Albert Architectes & Associ\u00e9s. Brussels architect Pierre Lallemand was responsible for designing the glass facade. Philippe Van der Velpen, interior designer at Procos, designed the reception on the first storey and all the workspaces. He was also in charge of furnishing the plenary chamber. Brucity, Brussels\u2019 new administrative building, stands apart for its impressive glass facade that symbolises the transparency of democratic processes. Eye-catchers are the atrium on the first storey and the elevators in two glass cylinders that connect the floors with one another. Reinforcing democratic principles The planning team applied democratic principles to the plenary chamber\u2019s design. For instance, all members have an equal say in decision-making processes. A circular or semi-circular seating layout encourages open debate. Just like the rest of the building, it\u2019s important in a democracy that the plenary chamber offers public access. Therefore, plenty of seats for people to see what\u2019s going on and easy-to-read signs were a must. Brucity\u2019s interiors are open and transparent \u2013 both the council\u2019s new plenary chamber, which replaces the one in the historic town hall, and the light-flooded public area on the first storey where locals come and go. The project focused on good acoustics so that attendees of meetings could hear and be heard well. The goal is for council members and Belgian citizens to be able to follow meetings and decision-making processes in their entirety. Technology also plays a key role. For instance, meetings can be live-streamed and Belgians can find information via video conferences or other digital tools. Daylight from the large windows and lighting throughout the building also foster transparency and create a pleasant environment. Flexible space concept According to the designer, creating a multipurpose environment was one of the most important aspects of the building\u2019s interior. The furniture needed to look prestigious but also be versatile. Most of the items of furniture are custom made and permanent features of the room. Van der Velpen chose Wilkhahn\u2019s mobile pieces of furniture to complement them. He picked Versa tables (design: Wolfgang C.R. Mezger) whose table tops\u2019 form and finish can be customised to suit preferences. Versa allows tables and table systems to be configured for various settings. The round plenary chamber encourages democratic debate. It was furnished with Wilkhahn\u2019s Intra conference chair, which can be replaced with the versatile Aline skid-base chair if required. Intra conference chairs (Phoenix Design) combine superior comfort with a design language that blends in perfectly with the interior design concept. If the plenary chamber needs furniture for a different type of meeting, the Versa tables and Intra chairs are taken away and replaced with Aline chairs (design: Andreas St\u00f6riko). The skid-base chair offers relaxing comfort. Ergonomic workspaces for diverse teams For the open-plan storeys, good acoustics played a key role. Creating separate spaces for teams that collaborate with one another and employees requiring peace and quiet for deep work was important. This goal is achieved by providing spaces for recreational and communicative purposes, single offices, or pods. In the workspaces, the AT office chair with the centring suspension of the seat shell ensures that people\u2019s bodies maintain their centre of gravity whatever posture they adopt. Using a different colour on each floor not only adds variety, it also helps people find their way about. The ergonomic AT office chair with its free-to-move capability encourages healthy dynamic sitting for staff in offices and at reception. It prevents backache and stimulates both body and mind to make office workers healthier and more productive. Similar to the other items of high-quality Wilkhahn office furniture, AT is also made of hardwearing, recyclable materials. Sustainable interior design In keeping with all public tenders for furniture and to ensure sustainability, Green Public Procurement (GPP) principles were also applied to the new Brussels administrative building. Environment-friendly materials and products such as FSC\/PEFC wood, recycled wool or low-VOC paints were, therefore, used in the construction and design. For the interior, huge emphasis was also placed on eco-friendly materials, products, and practices. This includes using recycled or upcycled materials for particular meeting spaces, reducing waste and energy consumption, and prioritising the health and wellbeing of users. What\u2019s more, using locally sourced materials and manufacturers has reduced transportation costs and carbon emissions. And the stringent ecological criteria were ultimately good reasons for picking Wilkhahn\u2019s long-lasting and sustainable office furniture. \u201cVersatility and sustainability were important factors in terms of the interior design. We were seeking furniture that would look superb in the prestigious council chamber and be versatile too, while blending in aesthetically with the overarching concept. Which is why we picked Wilkhahn\u2019s flexible and eco-friendly furniture,\u201d Van der Velpen explained. Photos: Georges De Kinder","filter_flag":1}
