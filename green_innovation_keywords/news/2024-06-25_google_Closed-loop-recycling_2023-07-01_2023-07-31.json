Within this complex environment, however, there is a series of initiatives involving packaging design, reassessing material selection, innovative recovery methods, and emerging recycling technologies that aim to increase the circularity of healthcare plastics. Thermoforms are widely used in healthcare settings, from medical device protection to pharmaceutical product preservation. For example, Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) is a polymer used extensively in healthcare packaging. PETG plays an essential, and irreplaceable role in the protection of sensitive sterile medical devices. Nevertheless, many hospitals and healthcare service providers (HSPs) lack the infrastructure to efficiently recycle PETG and other types of packaging, like rigid sterile barrier thermoformed trays commonly made of clear PET. Nearly all healthcare plastic packaging is incinerated or disposed of in landfills \u2014 despite the fact that most of these polymers are technically feasible to recycle, and only about 15% of packaging waste from healthcare facilities is considered hazardous.1 Accelerating progress toward sustainability The need to improve end-of-life outcomes and circularity for healthcare plastics is increasingly urgent, and a confluence of forces is inspiring action. The buying power of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and their environmentally preferred procurement (EPP) initiatives are emphasizing the importance of sustainability factors in purchasing decisions. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as Practice Greenhealth, are providing a framework and resources for the sector to leverage sustainability initiatives. Reduced and zero waste commitments are emerging at the healthcare facility level, which has ramifications on packaging design and end-of-life considerations. Additionally, legislative policy, regulation, investor focus, and evolving consumer demands are accelerating change. Stakeholders all along the healthcare value chain are collaborating to identify solutions that will enhance circularity. For instance, the Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC) is a technical consortium working in the US and Europe to increase plastic recycling efforts in clinical settings. They developed the Hospicycle toolkit for hospitals, as well as the Design Guidance for Healthcare Plastics Recycling resource to optimize package design for recycling. Source collection, volume aggregation, sortation logistics, and contamination risk management will all be key to unlocking the potential of recycled healthcare plastics. Closed-loop recycling, known as \u201ctake back\u201d programs, can also provide a circular option for specific applications and circumstances. At the same time, recycling technology is progressing at a rapid pace. Advanced recycling can enable a more circular future for healthcare plastics by providing solutions for hard-to-recycle materials. Purification, depolymerization, and conversion are techniques to break down a polymer to the molecular level and convert it into virgin-quality material for use in new products.2 Mass balance systems support advanced recycling technologies as a chain-of-custody protocol that tracks recycled content through manufacturing processes. Although it\u2019s not possible to trace the exact recycled molecules, recycled plastic in manufacturing is recorded and balanced with certified recycled content in end products. Incorporating a mass balance approach enables organizations to integrate sustainable raw materials, like those derived from advanced recycling processes, seamlessly into existing processes and assets. Specifically, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) PLUS is a globally recognized certification of compliance with robust environmental, social and traceability requirements. ISCC Plus and other mass balance systems are key to rapidly scaling sustainable material integration and credibly driving circularity. Simplifying complexity in medical device packaging Medical device manufacturers can re-engineer packaging to be more sustainable without sacrificing quality or efficiency. Down-gauging and right-sizing, when pursued holistically, can help reduce weight and material usage in packaging, thereby increasing transport and other downstream efficiencies that may reduce an organization\u2019s environmental impact. Merit Medical Systems, Inc., a manufacturer of single-use medical devices for interventional and diagnostic procedures, provides an excellent example. Merit was seeking a solution to eliminate shipping damage, decrease material waste, and reduce packaging costs.3 High impact polystyrene (HIPS) packaging is commonly used for shipping trays, yet it is a rigid and unforgiving material. Plastic Ingenuity helped Merit source a product capable of delivering the protection their delicate medical device required. Eastalite co-polyester, a novel foamed PETG material, provides lower density than traditional rigid materials, greater abrasion resistance, and improved shock absorption and impact strength. After selecting the material, Plastic Ingenuity\u2019s engineers designed a bulk universal tray capable of accommodating multiple devices within the product line while preventing device vibration and movement. Moreover, the redesign exceeded all functional, economic, and environmental goals. This first-to-market Eastalite application offers improved product protection and is robust enough for reuse at least four times. Plastic Ingenuity also optimized cube utilization 133%, accommodating 1,400 devices per pallet as compared to the initial 600 devices per pallet. Increased efficiencies reduced transatlantic freight costs 57% and minimized packaging material costs by 52%.3 Transformations for a circular future As the healthcare industry continues to place greater emphasis on sustainability, medical device manufacturers will be expected to adapt and evolve accordingly. Plastic packaging is integral to this sector and multiple advancements are enabling the development of innovative packaging solutions. It is increasingly possible to improve packaging efficiencies in performance, cost, and sustainability, while also delivering on patient safety. Through investments, partnerships, and common goals, the healthcare packaging industry is proactively transitioning to a circular economy that will help secure a future for generations to come.

The Container Recycling Institute (CRI) and Reloop, which work to advance container deposit systems and partnered on the study, said the research proves that \u201cbeverage industry concerns that deposit systems lead to sales declines are unfounded.\u201d The study, \u201cThe Impact of Deposit Return Systems on Beverage Sales,\u201d used data from a dozen deposit return system (DRS) markets around the world and looked at sales before and after the systems were introduced or expanded. It found that all sales fluctuations were within the normal variation range and aligned with regional trends and that there\u2019s been a general upward trend in per capita packaged beverage sales. \u201cMany complex and multifaceted factors contribute to changes in beverage sales, meaning any sales increases or decreases cannot only be attributed to deposit return systems,\u201d the study noted. Those factors include seasonal temperatures, economic conditions, supply chain disruptions or changing of labeling in advance of the start of a DRS. \u201cIn the months leading up to a DRS launch, distributors and retailers may sell their items at discounted prices to quickly sell off inventory with the old labels,\u201d the study noted. \u201cConsequently, sales of beverage products with the new labels may initially appear slower after DRS implementation as consumers will have stocked up beforehand. This may give the impression of a sales decline, but it actually reflects a shift in sales from one period to another.\u201d The study also added that some other previous studies could be unreliable if they used predictive modeling of the impacts of assumed higher prices, instead of historical market data. Susan Collins, CRI president, said in a press release that the research \u201cis as complete, thorough and transparent as possible, and represents experiences from all over the world over a two-decade timeframe.\u201d \u201cWe believe the findings should set to rest the fears of beverage producers and distributors and contribute to a more informed discourse on the adoption, implementation and expansion of beverage container deposit return systems,\u201d she added. The study, combined with previous findings that DRS significantly increase container recycling rates, make the systems \u201cthe most effective means to obtain more clean, high-quality materials for manufacturing new products.\u201d In response to other claims that DRS create higher costs across the distribution chain, the press release pointed out that costs associated with operating modern deposit programs are partially to fully offset by the scrap sales revenues and unclaimed deposits. DRS can also create savings in the form of reduced extended producer responsibility expenses in Europe and Canada and lower costs for municipalities and taxpayers, the press release stated. The CRI and Reloop study also reviewed older studies that found similar results. It cited a Swedish study in 2010 that found that the deposit had no statistically significant effects on sales; a 2011 study by the University of Florida that reported the impact of a DRS on beverage consumption is \u201cessentially zero\u201d; an Australian study in 2021 and a study on California in 2011 that both echoed the Florida study; and another 2011 study, this one in Massachusetts, that found no discernible difference in price between beverages in states with a DRS and those without. Clarissa Morawski is CEO of Reloop, which recently launched a newsletter, Bottle Bill Common Ground, that shares best practices of high-performing DRS In the release, Morawski stated that \u201cwhile producers often battle the introduction of deposit return systems because they wrongly believe they have a negative effect on sales, their impact assessments ignore the huge financial and compliance benefits of getting back up to 90% of their containers for closed-loop recycling.\u201d More stories about container deposits","filter_flag":1}

Varme Energy\u2019s technology allows industries to use this waste heat and generate electricity, which displaces fossil fuels and reduces emissions. This eliminates waste from reaching landfills and enables a sustainable solution for non-recyclable waste. 8. Agriculture Regenerative farming techniques improve soil health, enhance biodiversity, and sequester carbon. This improves the productivity and resilience of the land over time. Crop rotation and cover crops maintain soil health and manage pests naturally. This approach decreases reliance on external inputs and increases farm productivity and sustainability. In livestock farming, there is an increasing movement towards integrating animals into cropping systems to form mixed farming systems. Businesses are upcycling agricultural side streams into animal feeds, thereby reducing cultivation for feed. The concept of \u201cclosing the loop\u201d is also applied to waste management in agriculture. Rather than being discarded, organic waste, such as manure and crop residues, is composted and returned to the soil as a nutrient-rich amendment. Further, precision irrigation and rainwater harvesting prioritize water efficiency. New business models also directly connect farmers with consumers, reducing food waste in the supply chain and bringing consumers closer to the source of food. SWING Biomethane produces Biomethane SWING Biomethane is a French startup that generates biomethane. The startup collects organic residues and agricultural waste from local farmers and converts it into biogas. It then purifies and upgrades into biomethane \u2013 equivalent to the natural gas used daily by households or industries. The biomethane is either injected into the gas grid or liquefied into bio-LNG for the transportation sector. In addition to energy production, SWING Biomethane provides farmers with a sustainable fertilizer derived from the production of biomethane, known as digestate. It reduces their dependence on fossil fertilizers and greenhouse gas emissions. Swing Biomethane\u2019s approach lowers waste and creates local jobs, supports local farmers, and contributes to the decarbonization of the gas sector. 9. Construction Construction companies are integrating design for disassembly approach. This anticipates a building\u2019s end-of-life from the design stage, ensuring component reuse when the building is no longer needed. The use of reclaimed materials, like concrete and bricks, in new constructions reduces the demand for new materials and construction waste. Prefabrication and modular construction methods, powered by 3D printing, are also gaining popularity. It reduces waste and makes it easier to reuse and recycle materials. Further, the construction industry is adopting renewable energy and energy-efficient integrations to decrease energy consumption. Buildings-as-a-service shifts the focus from selling a product to selling a service, encouraging constructors to build for longevity. revitalyze.io facilitates Building Component Reuse French startup revitalyze.io promotes building component reuse.

The platform also supports automated matching and provides alerts about nearby materials, as well as connects businesses directly with suppliers. For project developers, municipalities, and building owners, the platform simplifies inventory analysis and increases sales. This approach reduces disposal costs, generates additional revenue, and actively contributes to a more circular economy. 10. Electronics Modular and repair-friendly architecture is gaining popularity in the consumer electronics market, reducing the need for new products. In parallel, the electronics industry is emphasizing the use of recycled or recyclable materials in product manufacturing. Companies are using reclaimed metals and other materials from end-of-life electronics in new devices, decreasing the need for virgin materials. In addition, the industry is focusing on comprehensive e-waste management strategies. With recycling programs, take-back schemes, and partnerships with recycling companies, manufacturers are recovering and reusing valuable materials from old electronics. There is also an increased focus on energy efficiency in electronic products to reduce power consumption. Circular Technologies simplifies IT Device Management Circular Technologies is an Italian startup that develops an IT device management solution.

Self-adhesive labels are a versatile packaging solution, and they follow eco-design principles to fit different packaging types and applications. The choice of a self-adhesive label and its components is application-dependent, and the design of the packaging needs to consider its complete life cycle, including recycling. During the recycling of PET containers, shredded PET flakes need to be separated from other materials as efficiently as possible. Specifically created 'wash-off' self-adhesive labels are designed to release from the PET container in the washing step of the recycling process. This results in clean PET flakes that enable closed-loop recycling. Labels incorporating permanent adhesives, on the other hand, might hinder recycling as these are not designed to be cleanly released in the washing conditions used and contaminate PET flakes or stick to the recycling equipment. Both technologies are visually indistinguishable but behave drastically differently during the recycling process. A whitepaper encourages producers of packaged goods to critically assess the overall recyclability of their packaging designs. For this purpose, Finat proposes a full value chain partnership between brand owners, converters and manufacturers of self-adhesive labels to ensure that the optimal label is used for a specific purpose, taking the recycling into account. Wash-off self-adhesive labels are an existing solution to increase the quantity and quality of recycled PET, thus enabling packaging circularity. The whitepaper is available for download here.","filter_flag":1}
