It is very easy for us to communicate with them, gather feedback, run surveys [and] really understand what they are looking for, and breakfast was a big gap for parents. It was a resounding point of feedback we were getting. Parents wanted their mornings to be easier [and] less hectic, and they wanted healthy options with protein that they can give their kids when they were running out the door. So, we are really answering that call,\u201d Vranich said. Little Spoon adds breakfast options following parents' demands\u200b Founded in 2017 by Lisa Barnett, Michelle Muller, Ben Lewis and Vranich, Little Spoon offers organic baby and toddler foods, including Babyblends purees, finger foods for children transitioning to solid food (Biteables), ready-to-eat dinners for children, smoothies and snacks. Last year, Little Spoon raised funding from existing investors, against a $300 million valuation, for a total of $90 million across five rounds. Little Spoon is profitable today, and it does not \"really have a need to raise any money anytime soon,\" Vranich said. After hearing from customers and parents who were seeking quick breakfast options, Vranich and her team of six food scientists developed a line of breakfast products that could be prepared in 90 seconds or less. The new products will be exclusively on the brand\u2019s website, starting at $6.49, and include: Pesto Eggs Biteable is a nut-free tray of cage-free scrambled eggs topped with parmesan, kale, diced apples and butternut squash cubes, providing 5 grams of protein per tray. Mini Classic Eggs + Sausage Biteable contains scrambled eggs, no-sugar-added pork sausage and cheese, providing 7 grams of protein per tray. The Classic Breakfast Plate features scrambled eggs, pork sausage, millet, sweet potato and carrot to provide 14 grams of protein per packaging. Additionally, Little Spoon will launch an overnight oat smoothie \u2014 available in Apple Cinnamon Swirl and Peach Berry Bliss flavors \u2014 on June 25 in collaboration with Oatly. \"Overnight oats are a wonderful breakfast option that many adults enjoy, [but] there are not a ton of overnight oats options marketed towards children. When we were thinking about how to bring this product to market, Oatley was an immediate idea for a lot of us in the office here. We are huge fans of Oatly at Little Spoon,\u201d she said. Going beyond DTC: \u2018Never say never\u2019\u200b Despite many DTC-started brands pivoting to retail, Little Spoon is committed to growing its DTC business, Vranich said. However, Little Spoon has done several small-scale retail partnerships, including Pop Up Grocer in New York. \u201cThe direct-to-consumer business model and the consumer that we are catering to really makes sense. So, our customers are coming to us when they are having babies or just children. They are staying with us all the way into school age. ... When we look at how we are selling our products, having that one-to-one relationship \u2014 that direct relationship with our customer \u2014 to be able to really market products to them as their children are growing makes a lot of sense for us. In retail, never say never. I think there could be some interesting opportunities for us out there in the future,\u201d Vranich said.","filter_flag":1}

In March, unit sales of plant-based meat fell 10.3% to $17.2m and volume sales in pounds fell 10.6% to $13.1m. Dollar sales fell 8.3% to 104.7m in the five weeks ending March 31 over the same period a year ago. Figures for the full year were even steeper with dollar sales for the 52 weeks ending March 31 dropping 12% year-over-year and unit sales sliding 16.6%. \u201cWinding the clock back, the big challenge was the spread between what was promised and what was delivered \u2026 was pretty big. So, you ended up with products that maybe did not taste as good or were not as healthy for you\u201d as their animal counterparts and when combined with plant-based products\u2019 premium pricing \u201ca perfect storm of dissatisfaction with consumers\u201d emerged, Eben Bayer, co-founder of plant-based bacon brand MyForest Foods, said during FoodNavigator-USA\u2019s webinar Plant-based 3:0: Emerging from the trough of disillusionment\u200b, \u200b which is now free to watch on demand. He explained that consumers who were willing to try plant-based proteins once, are now hesitant to do so again. In response to sluggish sales, retailers are cutting back on how many plant-based meat products they carry. Analysis of Circana data by 210 Analytics from the same period shows retailers carried an average of 10 to 11 refrigerated meat alternatives per store, which was down 14% year-over-year. This SKU rationalization is compounding the downward sales of plant-based meat because consumers cannot find the products they want in stores as easily \u2013 if at all, explained Julie Emmett, vice president of marketplace development at the Plant Based Foods Association and Plant Based Foods Institute. What will it take to earn back the trust of consumers?\u200b The first step in convincing consumers to take another chance on plant-based proteins is to create \u201ca great product,\u201d that delivers on the taste and nutrition consumers want at a price point they deem reasonable, said Annie Ryu, CEO of Jack & Annie\u2019s, which makes a range of jackfruit-based meat alternatives. \u201cIt starts with having great tasting foods. We went to market with foods that we are incredibly proud of and got consumer feedback proactively and addressed the different areas where people wanted us to make changes,\u201d she said. A common request she heard from consumers is they wanted plant-based products made with whole foods and ingredients that they recognized \u2013 two demands that Jack & Annie\u2019s easily meets as each product is made with minimally processed jackfruit, which the company explains in marketing materials and on packaging is a common plant that has been enjoyed as a meat alternative for thousands of years with minimal processing. \u201cJackfruit is capable of replicating foods that are typically made from beef, pork, chicken and seafood,\u201d in part because it has a texture that is \u201cnaturally similar to meat,\u201d she said. Using jackfruit as a base also allowed Jack & Annie\u2019s to \u201cget through some of the confusion that has impacted [the category] about consumers wondering what these foods are really made of and how are they made, because we started a whole education process about jackfruit before these questions really arose,\u201d she said. MyForest Foods likewise is able to bypass consumer concerns about over-processing by offering whole cut, organic mushroom root products that are grown on a farm, said Bayer. The clean ingredients in Jack & Annie\u2019s and MyForest Foods also allows them to deliver nutritional values that consumers want \u2013 including fiber and protein with less saturated fat. Winning over retailers requires a strong business case\u200b As for winning back the trust of retailers, and convincing them to stock a new or reformulated plant-based protein, Andrew Bluestein, co-founder and managing partner at Bluestein Ventures, advised manufacturers to complement \u201cgreat products\u201d with an equally compelling sales data story. \u201cYou have to get a great product and you have to communicate to the retailers why your product is great, why it is different, what is unique about it, why does it need what consumers are looking for,\u201d said. Brands need to pair that with data that shows they will be successful at retail, such as growth from direct-to-consumer sales or a promotion and marketing program that shows how they will drive velocities or how carrying their product might lead to an increase in complementary products \u2013 such as a plant-based condiments, pre-made sides from the deli or other items that round-out a meal. \u201cGo back to those fundamentals. It is not just about, \u2018Hey, we have got these great things going on online \u2013 all these great celebrity influencers who maybe come some notice. At the end of the day it is about \u2026 how do I make sure [the product] is shining on shelf and how do I get it off the shelf? I think some of those things are \u2026 demos, promotional programs, great packaging,\u201d he added. Emmett encouraged retailers to proactively work with plant-based meats to create a merchandising strategy that benefits the overall category. This could include in-store signs, consistent placement or grouping products together alongside animal-based offerings so that consumers can see the full range of options.

Functional ...","query":"https:\/\/www.bing.com\/news\/search?q=\"Eco-friendly Production\" \"new products\"&format=rss","text":"The wellness trend is in full swing, in fact, it\u2019s everywhere! From the gut health\u200b trend, aimed at overall wellbeing, to elimination diets\u200b, designed to identify food intolerances, the concept of \u2018food as medicine\u2019 has never been so popular. And where consumers lead, brands quickly follow, resulting in a whole range of products dedicated to improving health in one way or another. These are often referred to as functional foods and they are EVERYWHERE! But do consumers trust the slew of new products on the shelves and, if not, what can brands do to win them over? What are functional foods?\u200b Functional foods are foods, which claim to have an additional function, through the addition of particular ingredients. These functions typically relate to the promotion of better health. The term, functional food, can also apply to traits purposely bred into edible plants, such as purple potatoes, which have been modified to increase anthocyanin. Do consumers trust \u2018better-for-you\u2019 marketing on snacks?\u200b Trust in the food industry has seen a steady decline in recent years, with a recent report from EIT Food Consumer Observatory\u200b, finding that just 46%, of consumers surveyed, trust food manufacturers\u200b. Furthermore, only 44% believe the foods they are consuming, are healthy\u200b. But likely, the most concerning statistic for the food industry is the fact that 27% of consumers actively distrust food manufacturers\u200b. Consumer trust is essential to the success of any brand, so the news that consumer trust in the food industry is poor, and continuing to decline, will be make many in the food industry uneasy. Many consumers are paying much closer attention to the ingredients list on the back of a product to determine if a product is healthy. GettyImages\/SDI Productions So what about consumer trust in \u2018better-for-you\u2019 snacks? \u201cThere is definitely a certain level of confusion and mistrust surrounding nutritional and health claims on packaging,\u201d Dr Sara de Pelsmaeker, group health and wellbeing director of ingredients supplier Puratos, told FoodNavigator. \u201cSeventy-five percent of consumers look for product information on packaging, and in many cases, are also using it to judge how 'healthy' the product is.\" And it\u2019s this focus on information displayed on packaging, which is starting to raise questions for consumers, and ultimately, cause issues for manufacturers. Consumers may pick up a product based on the health claims on the front, and then place it back down when they read the ingredients list on the back. This is particularly true when the list of ingredients is longer than five items, as the \u2018clean label\u2019 movement gains popularity. So how is the food industry helping consumers to understand the nutritional value of a product? What is the \u2018clean label\u2019 movement?\u200b Though there is no official definition, \u2018clean label\u2019 is the concept of making a product using as few ingredients as possible, and ensuring those ingredients are ones that consumers recognise. These will ideally be ingredients that consumers would themselves use when cooking at home. How is the food industry improving nutritional transparency?\u200b The food industry is being increasingly regulated and, as a result, health claims must be backed up by facts. \u201cFront-of-pack labelling is now used by food producers in around 40 countries, either voluntarily or because they are legally required to do so,\u201d explains Pelsmaeker. \u201cThese schemes serve two purposes, providing shoppers with more information to make healthier choices and encouraging the industry to develop more nutritionally balanced foods. Better transparency of ingredient lists means brands can no longer rely on the 'health halo' of a single ingredient. To help rebalance fat, sugar and salt content, the approach should be a 'proactive', health-centred reformulation exercise, to both improve products and restore consumer trust.\u201d There is also additional certification, which brands can apply, and work to qualify, for. \u201cWhere confidence may have dwindled, signifiers such as the B Corp certification help maintain trust,\" Jackie Wilson, Kall\u00f8 brand controller at Ecotone UK, told FoodNavigator. Nutritional information labelling, such as Nutri-Score, are helping to make the nutritional rating of a product clearer for consumers. It has been recommended for use by the European Union and the World Health Organization. GettyImages\/Viktoriia Ablohina What is the future of \u2018better-for-you\u2019 snacking?\u200b Many consumers are making a return to seasonal eating and buying local\u200b, as a means to fully understand the provenance of their food. And it appears this trend is being echoed when it comes to having a better understanding of the contents of the foods they\u2019re eating. \u201cAccording to our Taste Tomorrow research, 71% of consumers are more likely to buy from bakeries where everything is made with natural ingredients,\u201d explains Puratos\u2019 Pelsmaeker. \u201cThis demonstrates the demand for cleaner label finished goods and more transparency about nutritional information, and the snacking industry must evolve to meet these consumer demands.\u201d But when products are bought from supermarkets, communication with consumers needs to be clear and concise. \u201cThe future of the food industry needs clear, consistent and visible labelling of ingredients and nutritional profiles to draw consumers to the products they can trust,\u201d adds Kall\u00f8's Wilson. Governments are also going further to, not only encourage, but work with food manufacturers, to reduce fat, sugar and salt\u200b levels in foods. But the challenge comes in ensuring those foods are still tasty. \u201cUltimately, of course, we\u2019re aiming for healthy snacks that don\u2019t compromise on indulgence,\u201d says Pelsmaeker. This sentiment is echoed by Kall\u00f8's Wilson. \u201cTaste will continue to be a priority to consumers \u2013 and something you can\u2019t lose sight of within better-for-you snacks. It will continue to lead innovation with eight out of 10 people looking for new flavours within snacking.\u201d These developments all represent a step in the right direction, but whether food brands can regain consumer trust remains to be seen.

And unlike other trends (plant-based\u200b I\u2019m looking at you) it shows no signs of slowing. So why is the gut health trend so successful and how have manufacturers turned it into the gold mine it\u2019s become? Why has the gut health trend become so popular?\u200b By now, many are acquainted with terms like microbiome and probiotics (we\u2019ve included a factbox below, if you\u2019re unfamiliar). In fact, for some consumers, these terms have entered into common parlance in a way few would have predicted just a decade ago. According to the International Probiotics Association (IPA) 63% of European consumers surveyed knew what probiotics and probiotic foods were. \u201cWe live in a time where a simple Google search for \u2018probiotics products\u2019 shows over 94 million hits,\u201d says a spokesperson for the IPA. \u201cThe probiotics market continuously expands with the globalisation of online sales, and probiotics are increasingly popular and widely advertised on the Internet.\u201d And this is not limited to Europe alone. Figures from market research firm, Mintel, show that nearly three in five US adults say they try to eat foods that encourage a healthy gut. Furthermore, market research firm, Marketresearch.biz, estimates that the global digestive health products market will reach a value of approximately 94.4 billion USD within the next decade (2032). Kombucha can be made at home, but multiple brands are also launching their own versions. GettyImages\/NatalyaStepowaya So why has gut health become so popular? Many consumers first became aware of the concept of gut-friendly food and beverage products with the launch of probiotic milk drinks such as Yakult, Actimel and Muller Vitality back in the 1990s. \u201cConsumer understanding of gut health has grown significantly in recent years, and we attribute this to various factors,\" Reshma Patel, marketing manager at Yakult UK, told FoodNavigator. \"While probiotics have been recognised globally for some time, it\u2019s only relatively recently that scientific advancements have highlighted the profound impact of gut health on overall wellbeing. It extends way beyond digestion, with growing evidence revealing the interconnection of the body's major organs, with the gut at the centre of this intricate system. Another driving force has been a cultural shift towards preventive health measures rather than just focusing on cure. People are being increasingly proactive in maintaining their health, rather than waiting for diseases or illnesses to strike.\" Since then, consumer interest and understanding has grown exponentially. One of the potential reasons for this is the increase in gastrointestinal issues. \u201cCurrent data suggest that the incidence and prevalence of these GI disorders, which includes the most common functional disorders, are generally increasing, with the highest rates reported in eastern European countries and in less affluent parts of western Europe,\u201d explains a spokesperson for United European Gastroenterology (UEG). Moreover, figures from UEG show that gastrointestinal and liver disorders are responsible for around one million deaths across Europe each year and are associated with substantial morbidity and healthcare costs. Fermented drinks, such as kefir, have become popular with gut health enthusiasts. GettyImages\/minoandriani How have manufacturers monetised gut health?\u200b It\u2019s no surprise that where consumers lead, food and beverage manufacturers follow, and when it comes to gut health, follow they have\u2026 in a big way. From gut-friendly drinks to gut-friendly flapjacks, the food and beverage industry is awash with gut-friendly products. But along with the perhaps less legitimate gut health marketing claims (mentioning no names!), comes some true innovation. Firms across the world are developing new products to support the gut health of people of all ages. Dutch ingredients start-up, NutriLeads\u200b, is exploring the gut health potential of carrots, while British start-up, Little Inca\u200b, is developing products to support the gut microbiota of infants, with quinoa-based baby foods. \u201cOver the last ten years the patents and filings related to food and drink with probiotics added to them has just soared,\u201d Mintel's Miller said during a recent Fi Webinar Series. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an exponential growth of probiotic infused products.\u201d Sourdough bread has become a firm favourite amongst bread fans and it comes with the added benefit of being gut friendly. GettyImages\/alvarez What\u2019s next for the gut health trend?\u200b The gut health trend is on the up and up\u200b, with consumer interest, understanding, and demand for gut-friendly products, continuing to grow. \u201cGut health really is an important area within food and drink, particularly functional food and drink,\" says Rick Miller, associate director for specialised nutrition at market research firm Mintel. \"It\u2019s moving away from the common areas that we would have associated with gut health in food and drink, which is functional and clinical management and moving into the everyday gut health support, so for conditions like functional bloating and irritable bowel syndrome.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
