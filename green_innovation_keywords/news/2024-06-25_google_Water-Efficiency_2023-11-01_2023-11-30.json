It\u2019s simply a series of small strategies you can start today \u2013 and from the comfort of your own home. Eco-friendly home improvements According to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), 40 per cent of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions come from its households. So, when it comes to improving the eco-friendliness of your life, your own home is the best place to start. Small changes made during routine home maintenance could include: Switching to energy-efficient lighting: Are your light bulbs of the traditional, incandescent variety? If so, replace them with energy-efficient LED (light emitting diode) or CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) kinds. CFL bulbs are around 25 per cent more energy-efficient than traditional bulbs, while LEDs are 75 per cent more efficient. Are your light bulbs of the traditional, incandescent variety?

CFL bulbs are around 25 per cent more energy-efficient than traditional bulbs, while LEDs are 75 per cent more efficient. Installing a smart thermostat: With a programmable thermostat, you\u2019ll be able to control your home\u2019s temperature remotely, with an app \u2013 setting heating and cooling schedules, and optimising how you heat and cool your property. With a programmable thermostat, you\u2019ll be able to control your home\u2019s temperature remotely, with an app \u2013 setting heating and cooling schedules, and optimising how you heat and cool your property. Using natural, toxin-free materials: Integrate long-lasting wooden flooring and timber double-glazed windows \u2013 and steer clear of plastic carpets and uPVC (unplasticised polyvinyl chloride) windows. When painting your home, choose a low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) paint. Reducing the amount of VOC solvents in your home\u2019s interior will also reduce levels of indoor pollution \u2013 and improve its air quality. Low-carbon heating systems Investing in an energy-efficient heating system is a must \u2013 and here, heat pumps excel. Heat pumps draw heat from the external environment to keep a home\u2019s internal environment toasty in winter. They can also be used to heat water and, specifically, only when it\u2019s needed \u2013 minimising heat loss from storage tanks. Despite the name, though, heat pumps don\u2019t just heat \u2013 they can also be reappropriated, at the height of summer, to cool your home\u2019s interior spaces, too. The best part? Heat pumps are around three times more efficient than gas boilers. They\u2019re more futureproof, too \u2013 especially considering the UK\u2019s incoming gas boiler ban. The ban, effective from 2025, will apply to new-build homes only. However, the government is encouraging \u2013 and incentivising \u2013 properties in the UK and Wales to switch to heat pumps via the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS). The grants it\u2019s offering can take around \u00a35,000 off the total cost of an air-source heat pump, or up to \u00a36,000 off one of the ground-source variety. Another strategy worth considering? Underfloor heating. These systems tend to use less energy to heat a home. They\u2019re more environmentally friendly than radiators, and can reduce the embedded carbon in a home by up to 93 per cent. The same data suggests that, while radiators have a lifespan of around 25 years, underfloor heating lasts up to 75 years \u2013 three times that. If you\u2019re stuck with radiators, however, ensure to use a zoning system to distribute heat. Zoned heating systems allow you to heat different areas of your home independently, based on which rooms you and your family are spending the most time in. This prevents wastage, and the overheating of unoccupied rooms. Insulation and weatherproofing Making a home airtight and insulated involves sealing gaps and cracks in your home\u2019s walls, windows, and doors to prevent heat loss in the winter \u2013 and keep your place cool in summer. It\u2019ll also make your home more energy-efficient, and help you save on your energy bills. Wall insulation Insulating your external walls is vital \u2013 be it using internal external or cavity insulation. A report by the UK government\u2019s Department for Energy Security & Net Zero revealed that 29 per cent of homes with a cavity wall \u2013 and 9 per cent of properties with solid walls \u2013 were lacking insulation. Without insulation in your external walls, you\u2019re heating your home inefficiently \u2013 which, given the energy price cap increases of the last two years, isn\u2019t something many families can afford to do. Floor insulation Similarly, if you don\u2019t have underfloor insulation, you could be losing 20 per cent of your heating and cooling capacity. So, insulate these areas with polyester insulation batts \u2013 chemical-free and non-flammable, they\u2019re the most sustainable, eco-friendly choice for your home. Loft insulation The aforementioned Home Office report also suggested that only 17 million homes had loft insulation at the end of 2022 \u2013 just two thirds (67 per cent) of the total properties with a loft. So, when insulating your home\u2019s floors and walls, don\u2019t forget its upper reaches \u2013 and explore the Energy Saving Trust\u2019s roof and loft insulation guide for actionable and affordable tips for how to set your loft up for energy efficiency. Weatherproofing and draughtproofing Weatherproofing and draughtproofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save both money and energy, says Dr Sarah Price, Head of Building Physics at low-energy design company, Enhabit. So, once you\u2019ve insulated your home, target all the places cold air could enter it \u2013 windows, loft hatches, and letterboxes \u2013 and fill around them them with sealant. You can also get this done, professionally, for around \u00a3250. As for your windows, consider replacing single-glazed ones with their double- or triple-glazed counterparts. These types of windows have inert gas fills between the panes, as well as low-emissivity (low-E) coatings. Together, these combine to improve insulation and reduce heat transfer \u2013 keeping your home warmer in the colder seasons. Renewable energy sources Renewable sources of energy generate clean, green power that\u2019ll heat your home \u2013 without growing your carbon footprint. They\u2019ll also save you money: helping you not only fulfil your obligations to your wallet, but to the environment, too. Sources of renewable energy include: Solar energy: This is a longer-term investment, but after paying the initial price of solar panels, over time they will save you money. Not only will you reduce your reliance on traditional power sources, but actually make money from them: selling your surplus power back to the grid.

Not only will you reduce your reliance on traditional power sources, but actually make money from them: selling your surplus power back to the grid. Wind energy: Depending on where you live \u2013 and your access to consistent wind patterns \u2013 you may be able to install small wind turbines on your property to generate power. For obvious reasons, this is better suited to homes in more rural locations.

Geothermal energy: Ground source heat pumps use the constant temperature of the Earth\u2019s subsurface to heat and cool homes efficiently and reliably. Ground source heat pumps use the constant temperature of the Earth\u2019s subsurface to heat and cool homes efficiently and reliably. Biomass energy: This involves using organic materials (wood; agricultural residues; waste) to generate heat or electricity through the burning or fermentation processes. Energy-efficient appliances Being more eco-friendly can be as simple as adapting those daily, seemingly trivial behaviours that \u2013 though they appear small \u2013 can actually compound to make a big difference on our planet and prospects. From how you wash the dishes to how you heat up Tuesday\u2019s leftovers, here\u2019s how energy-efficient appliances can make a difference: Refrigerators: Energy-efficient fridges come with better insulation, advanced compressor technology, and more accurate temperature control \u2013 meaning they require far less energy to keep your food fresh. Energy-efficient fridges come with better insulation, advanced compressor technology, and more accurate temperature control \u2013 meaning they require far less energy to keep your food fresh. Washing machines: Energy-efficient washing machines rely on water-saving technology and improved drum designs to use less water and power per cycle. As for drying, limit the use of your tumble dryer in favour of air drying \u2013 inside or out.

As for drying, limit the use of your tumble dryer in favour of air drying \u2013 inside or out. Air conditioners: While energy-efficient air conditioners \u2013 that adjust their cooling output to match the cooling load required \u2013 do exist, they\u2019re generally not the most eco-friendly solution. A better, albeit more expensive, alternative? A mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) unit, or an air source heat pump that can also be used as an air conditioner.

A better, albeit more expensive, alternative? A mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) unit, or an air source heat pump that can also be used as an air conditioner. Ovens and stoves: Energy-efficient ovens and stoves offer better insulation, precise temperature control, and cooking convection options. These not only cook food faster \u2013 but do so in a way that uses less energy, and is more affordable to boot. The range of energy-efficient appliances doesn\u2019t end here, either. From pool pumps and ventilation systems to a wealth of smart devices (light bulbs, garage door openers, plugs, doorbells), there\u2019s no limit to how environmentally friendly you can set your place up to be. You can also make greener choices not only around how you use your electricity \u2013 but where you buy it, too. Researching the best renewable energy suppliers and opting to buy electricity from them, is an excellent place to start. Water conservation Water won\u2019t run out. But cleaning and filtering dirty water for reuse for drinking and showers requires resources. Every litre of water your home wastes is one that takes energy to process and prepare before it can flow back through our taps again. So what some of the things you can do around the house to conserve our H2O \u2013 and lower your water bills? Fitting water-saving fixtures: A dripping tap leaking 10 drops of water per minute could see 90 litres of water per month \u2013 or 20,000 litres per year \u2013 wasted. So, replace old faucets, showerheads, and toilets with water-saving fixtures. These use less water without compromising functionality.

So, replace old faucets, showerheads, and toilets with water-saving fixtures. These use less water without compromising functionality. Take shorter showers: Get into the habit of entering the shower as soon as you can, rather than letting it reach a certain temperature before you climb in. You can also try using a shower timer \u2013 set at five minutes, perhaps \u2013 to hold you to account to shorter shifts in the shower.

You can also try using a shower timer \u2013 set at five minutes, perhaps \u2013 to hold you to account to shorter shifts in the shower. Collect and reuse water: For a basic, DIY solution, place a bucket in your shower (or outside, if it\u2019s raining) to catch excess water. You can then use this, later, to water plants or clean your home\u2019s outdoor spaces. For a more advanced approach, try a rainwater harvesting system for your home. These collect rainwater and reuse it as grey water (for watering your garden, flushing your toilet and in your washing machine).

These collect rainwater and reuse it as grey water (for watering your garden, flushing your toilet and in your washing machine). Wash full loads only: Limit use of your dishwasher or washing machine to when you have a full load to maximise water efficiency. Using technology \u2013 such as energy-efficient washing machines and the water-saving fixtures we mentioned above \u2013 is an excellent way to conserve water. But in many cases, being responsible with water is as simple as using a broom (instead of a hose) to clean your driveway, or turning off the tap while you\u2019re brushing your teeth. Waste reduction and recycling Recycling is vital to an environmentally friendly household. But it\u2019s not simply how you deal with your home\u2019s refuse that\u2019s important \u2013 but reducing the amount you produce in the first place. To boost your home\u2019s waste reduction efforts, try: Avoiding single-use items: Plastic straws, utensils, cups, and water bottles are all a no-no for the environment. Instead, choose reusable alternatives, such as stainless steel, bamboo or glass. Plastic straws, utensils, cups, and water bottles are all a no-no for the environment. Instead, choose reusable alternatives, such as stainless steel, bamboo or glass. Reusing bags and containers: Don\u2019t toss out that plastic takeaway box! It can be reused for leftovers or lunches \u2013 or to store household food staples like nuts, cereal, or coffee. Don\u2019t toss out that plastic takeaway box! It can be reused for leftovers or lunches \u2013 or to store household food staples like nuts, cereal, or coffee. Composting organic waste: Set up a composting system for food scraps and other yard waste. It\u2019ll save it from the landfill, while creating nutrient-rich soil for your garden\u2019s plants to thrive in. Set up a composting system for food scraps and other yard waste. It\u2019ll save it from the landfill, while creating nutrient-rich soil for your garden\u2019s plants to thrive in. Making (not buying) cleaning products: Simple ingredients, such as vinegar and baking soda, can be combined to emulate shop-bought cleaning supplies. Making these yourself reduces reliance on chemical-filled products: cutting down on packaging.
