From Leonardo DiCaprio (who is actually an investor in the brand) to Ben Affleck to Kristen Bell and Robert Downey Jr. A-listers just can\u2019t seem to get enough of L\u00f8ci. But why all the fuss? It turns out that this London-based brand doesn\u2019t just make great, comfy sneakers, but it also uses sustainable and vegan materials. And that\u2019s a big tick in our book. Here\u2019s more about L\u00f8ci, its celebrity fanbase, and some of our favorite sneaker picks. What is the L\u00f8ci brand? L\u00f8ci is already incredibly popular, but it\u2019s actually still a relatively new brand in the sneaker market. It was founded in 2020 by Frank Eribo and Philippe Homsy, who were concerned about the amount of animal products used in the fashion industry. The shoe sector, in particular, is reliant on the leather industry, which is linked with deforestation, rising emissions, and the slaughter of millions of animals every year. Eribo and Homsy decided it was time to create sustainable, ethical sneakers that wouldn\u2019t impact the environment in the same way. \u201cWe wanted to create a premium vegan alternative, where customers wouldn\u2019t have to compromise on style or quality,\u201d they told Soho House. With that in mind, the brand makes all of its products with eco-conscious materials, like corn leather, recycled plastic, and cork, in ethically run factories in Portugal, where every worker earns a living wage. The collections are also produced in small drops to reduce waste, and each purchase gives back to the environment\u201410 percent of all profits are donated to marine conservation nonprofits. Who wears L\u00f8ci sneakers? L\u00f8ci\u2019s sustainability focus and its top-quality sneaker design have turned it into a hit with celebrities. Some of its most famous fans include those mentioned above, plus Sophie Turner, Eva Longoria, Mila Kunis, Nikki Reed, Jessica Alba, Kylie Jenner, Olivia Wilde, and Lucy Hale, who recently partnered with the brand on her own capsule edit. DiCaprio also announced his investment in the brand just over a year after it launched. \u201cI am proud to be an investor in L\u00f8ci,\u201d the A-list actor and environmentalist said in a statement. \u201c[It\u2019s] a brand dedicated to minimizing its environmental impact, and centered around creating cruelty-free, ethical footwear.\u201d Speaking to Forbes, Homsy praised DiCaprio\u2019s decision to invest. \u201cToday, sustainability is one of the most used buzzwords,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cWe want L\u00f8ci to cut through the noise and be judged by our impact. Through education, innovation, and donations, we\u2019ve built a business model that is driven by our passion. With Leo, we could not have hoped for a more genuine and committed partner.\u201d The best vegan sneakers from L\u00f8ci It\u2019s celeb-approved, stylish, respectful of the planet, and 100 percent vegan.
