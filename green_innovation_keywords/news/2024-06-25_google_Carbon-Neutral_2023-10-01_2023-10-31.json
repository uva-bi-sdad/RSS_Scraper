Last month, Top 40 supplier Koozie Group (asi\/40480) and its sister company IMAGEN Brands (asi\/93990) announced that it had received CarbonNeutral certification. In this Q&A, Victoria Sierra, compliance manager for Koozie Group, explains why this milestone is so important, how the supplier is reducing emissions and what other promo companies can do to follow in their (shrinking) carbon footprint. Victoria Sierra, compliance manager at Koozie Group Q: Why was pursuing carbon neutrality an important part of Koozie Group\u2019s strategy? A: This is a critical time in the promotional products industry as we address the issues facing our planet. Sustainability is important not only to our distributors and their end-users, but also to our employees and their families. We want to lead the promotional products industry in these efforts by going beyond just selling sustainable products to taking this next step in our corporate responsibility journey. One of our core values \u2013 we call them People Powers \u2013 is \u201cOne Team,\u201d because each member of the company contributes to our overall success. We think the same can be said about the planet: We\u2019re all on the same team inhabiting Earth, and we want to contribute to this team\u2019s success. Simply put, we think the best way for us to keep the good going is to do good. Q: Can you share some details about steps you\u2019ve taken to reduce carbon emissions in daily operations? A: We\u2019ve tried to reduce our carbon footprint as a whole in a few different ways. Here are a few examples: \u2022 To reduce single-use plastics within our facilities, we eliminated Styrofoam cups and plastic stir sticks, and we provide new employees with reusable drinkware during onboarding. \u2022 We also reuse broken or scrapped parts of pens that we manufacture in-house by melting the parts down and re-manufacturing them into a new pen. \u2022 We stopped using plastic packaging for acrylic drinkware, eliminating the need for up to 1.9 million plastic bags annually. \u2022 We\u2019re in the middle of a rolling change to #4 LDPE plastic when the use of plastic is unavailable. Q: Carbon offsetting can be a little controversial (there was that Guardian report at the beginning of the year about \u201cphantom credits,\u201d for example). How do you choose reputable projects and ensure your company isn\u2019t engaging in greenwashing? A: We went the certification route because we wanted a third party to validate our findings, but we specifically went with Climate Impact Partners because they were able to verify the authenticity of carbon credits and assist with selecting projects that align with our values. Because we are new to carbon offsetting, we wanted a partner that has experience in both the carbon market and with businesses operating in a variety of different areas. Our partner ensures we are buying legitimate credits while helping us avoid greenwashing when discussing our efforts. Q: Among the carbon offsets Koozie Group is supporting is an Amazon rainforest conservation project in Brazil. Can you elaborate on how the project works and why you selected it? A: Because of our large calendar and Souvenir Sticky Note business, we really wanted to support a project related to paper. The Amazon REDD+ project in Brazil focuses on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and (forest) Degradation. Without other options, communities will raze rainforests to convert the area to farmland to try to earn a living. Not only does this result in losing some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, but the resulting agriculture may not even be enough to sustain the community. This project helps preserve rainforests by working with local communities to provide better income, education and sustainable forestry training. \u201cIt\u2019s well established that consumers are looking beyond a company\u2019s product or service offerings and are beginning to look at a company\u2019s environmental and social efforts. As more companies want to do better for our environment, they\u2019ll start looking toward offsets and carbon neutrality.\u201d Victoria Sierra Q: You\u2019ve said the next step in your journey is measuring Scope 3 emissions. Can you talk a little more about how those are different than Scope 1 and 2, and how you can measure and reduce those indirect emissions? A: Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are relatively easy to track because they are under our direct control, or we have a simple way to document them. Internally, we refer to Scope 1 as the \u201cburn\u201d emissions because they most commonly result from burning fuel in our fleet vehicles. With gas station receipts or looking at mileage of a car, it\u2019s relatively easy to track our emissions from this source. We refer to Scope 2 as the \u201cbuy\u201d emissions because they are the emissions that result from our energy purchases. Similar to the burn emissions, we can document these thanks to the monthly usage on our electric bills. Scope 3 is the ethereal \u201cbeyond\u201d emissions category because we don\u2019t produce them, and they\u2019re not directly controlled by us, even though we are responsible for them. This includes things like employee commuting, business travel and shipping. This scope is harder to track because there are many different factors that go into it (the distance or method of travel, package size, etc.) and the category is so broad \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a catch-all of things that don\u2019t fit into the other two categories but still cause emissions. In total, we are working on nine Scope 3 categories and are already carbon neutral on seven of those. To reach our goal, we plan to measure and reduce these emissions even further through a variety of activities. For example, we were able to approximate our business travel emissions by determining the amount spent on total company travel, approximating how many trips were done between all our sites, then applying the average carbon footprint to each trip. In our efforts to minimize emissions where we can, we have continued work-from-home and hybrid policies and offer local pickup for orders. Q: Do you anticipate carbon neutral certification to become more widespread in the promo industry? A: We certainly hope so, because we think it\u2019s just the starting point for all industries, not just promo. It\u2019s well established that consumers are looking beyond a company\u2019s product or service offerings and are beginning to look at its environmental and social efforts. As more companies want to do better for our environment, they\u2019ll start looking toward offsets and carbon neutrality. We think the next step is reducing emissions with science-based targets and eventually becoming net-zero. Carbon neutrality and net-zero are often used interchangeably, but net-zero means that you have gotten rid of all emissions, rather than just offsetting any emissions you\u2019ve made. Q. What are some tips for other promo companies looking to shrink their carbon footprint? A: It\u2019s hard to shrink your carbon footprint without knowing the size of it, so the best place to start is by tracking your greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 2 is probably the easiest jumping-off point since everyone gets a bill from their local electric company, so all the information is in one place. Scope 1 might take a bit more legwork to get started, but once it\u2019s rolling, it\u2019ll be relatively easy to collect the information. With this information, companies can make informed decisions on measures they can take to internally reduce their footprint \u2013 and work with reputable consultants to offset any unavoidable emissions.","filter_flag":1}

Transitioning from carbon-based fuels to hydrogen and the capture of carbon dioxide both have the potential for a significant impact on the existing pipeline infrastructure across the country. The pipeline industry is working to address these challenges and TRC is heavily involved in tracking these efforts. While the transportation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by pipeline is not new, it does require the use of different materials, methods of construction, quality control testing and operational procedures than traditional hydrocarbon pipelines. Of the more than 3 million miles of pipelines in operation in the U.S., less than 1% of those pipelines were designed and constructed to transport carbon dioxide or hydrogen. In order to meet carbon reduction goals, existing pipelines may need to be repurposed to transport carbon dioxide, hydrogen or hydrogen\/natural gas blends. Hydrogen: The Zero Emission Fuel While the combustion of natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based fuels produces carbon dioxide as a residual byproduct, the combustion of hydrogen produces water as the only byproduct. Blending of hydrogen into natural gas is the first step in the transition to a hydrogen fuel economy. A total duplication of the natural gas infrastructure for purity hydrogen would cost trillions of dollars and take decades to construct. Blending of hydrogen into existing natural gas is the most cost-effective approach and will result in the immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is currently modifying the natural gas pipeline standard to accommodate the blending of hydrogen into natural gas. The pipeline industry is spending millions of dollars on research to determine the safe amount of hydrogen that can be blended into existing natural gas pipelines with no modifications, and to determine what changes will need to be made to safely transport higher blends, potentially up to 100% hydrogen. The results of this research will be reviewed by the appropriate ASME committee and adopted into the natural gas pipeline standard for use by the industry and regulators. Carbon Dioxide \u2013 Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions Carbon Dioxide has been transported by pipelines as a liquid for decades for use primarily in enhanced oil recovery in underground formations and is already covered by existing ASME standards. Most of this carbon dioxide has come from naturally occurring underground reservoirs or separated from raw natural gas streams as part of the treating process. Today\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reductions are focused on the removal of carbon dioxide from industrial processes such as the production of ethanol, or from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels for electrical power generation or industrial uses. This carbon dioxide recovery will be at low pressure and may require its transportation as a vapor instead of as a liquid, which currently is not covered by an ASME standard. After the carbon dioxide is recovered it will need to be transported to a suitable location for injection into an underground formation for sequestration. ASME is in the process of reviewing the current carbon dioxide liquid transportation standard to determine what inspection, testing and modifications will be required to convert existing gas or liquid pipelines for the transmission of carbon dioxide. At the same time, the current natural gas transportation standard is also under review to determine similar requirements for transporting carbon dioxide as a gas. All of these modifications are necessary to ensure that all forms of carbon dioxide can be transported safely to their final destination.

HONEYWELL AND GRANBIO TO PRODUCE CARBON NEUTRAL SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL. GranBio's patented AVAP process converts biomass, including forest and agricultural residues, to pure low-cost, low-carbon-intensity sugars, lignin, and nanocellulose. The cellulosic sugars are converted to both SAF, through Honeywell's ETJ technology, and biochemicals, through a separate process. Using forest biomass-derived ethanol from the AVAP process, jet fuel produced from Honeywell's ethanol to jet fuel process can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net zero on a total lifecycle basis, compared to petroleum-based jet fuel1. \"Combining our biorefinery expertise with Honeywell experience in developing and scaling fuel technologies will help ensure SAF supply goals, while supporting GranBio's mission to provide integrated value chain solutions throughout the world for net zero SAF from biomass,\" said Bernardo Gradin, GranBio CEO. \"The AVAP technology has great potential, depending on feedstock and plant configuration to allow carbon negative SAF with current life cycle analysis.1\" \"Plus, in addition to vast forest and agricultural residue available for feedstocks, there is an enormous potential to retrofit idle pulp and paper facilities in the U.S., revitalizing forestry value chains and rural manufacturing with great social, environmental, and economic impact,\" Gradin added. \"GranBio's low carbon feedstock coupled with Honeywell's SAF expertise will help decarbonize air travel,\" said Barry Glickman, vice president, general manager, Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. \"Our advanced ETJ process is ready-now and builds upon Honeywell's near twenty years' experience in renewable fuels. Honeywell's renewable fuels solutions, including ETJ, incorporate integrated, modular designs, that enable producers like GranBio to build new SAF capacity more than a year faster than is possible with traditional construction approaches.\" GranBio's AVAP aims to enable worldwide net zero SAF production by utilizing abundant, low-cost biomass feedstocks and diversification of income streams through value-added products beyond SAF, providing significant cost advantage as compared to other SAF producers. GranBio's subsidiary AVAPCO was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive an $80M grant to support the demonstration plant that will produce ~2 million gallons per year of SAF upon start-up in 2026. Honeywell now offers solutions across a range of feedstocks to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable fuels, including SAF. In addition to Honeywell UOP Ecofining\u2122, Honeywell's renewable fuels portfolio includes ethanol to jet technology and the recently announced Honeywell UOP eFining\u2122, which converts green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into eFuels. Honeywell recently committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035. This commitment builds on the company's track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decades-long history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals. About 60% of Honeywell's 2022 new product introduction research and development investment was directed toward ESG-oriented outcomes for customers.2 About Honeywell Honeywell (www.honeywell.com) delivers industry-specific solutions that include aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings and industry; and performance materials globally.

Carbon offsets have a bunch of advantages that companies really like. They\u2019re a quick and cost-effective way to offset their carbon footprint with the subsequent positive PR of claiming carbon neutrality. What\u2019s more, they fit right into short-term business plans without needing to shake up production or operations to tackle more difficult to abate greenhouse gas emissions (think scope 3 emissions). It\u2019s no surprise, then, that our global data show an 87.8% increase in staple grocery foods using \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 and \u2018reduced carbon\u2019 claims in the past two years; in dairy products there has been a 79.4% jump. But carbon neutral claims and the voluntary carbon market are under fire. Critics see them as a shortcut to \u2018out-green\u2019 the competition, and attract a premium price. Food companies have certainly found the temptation hard to ignore and our research suggests this has led to a dangerous disconnect. In a recent survey we conducted, about one-third of food and retail professionals said their companies are using carbon offsets. That\u2019s double the number that said their company has a net-zero strategy in place \u2013 which means that twice as many companies are using offsets as a patchwork solution rather than actually mapping out a strategy to become net-zero. It raises some eyebrows and begs the question: what positive changes have carbon neutrality and offsets driven? Those in the voluntary carbon market, certifiers of carbon neutral and the companies making claims, are desperately looking for answers. Meanwhile, it\u2019s important not to demonise all such claims and offsets as greenwashing. The idea of carbon neutrality and offsets has sparked important conversations that we weren\u2019t having before. Businesses are now much more aware of their carbon footprints than they used to be, and even if some are using offsets as a quick fix, at least they\u2019re having to measure, track, and acknowledge their emissions in the first place. Many more certainly need to do so. Consumers are also becoming more informed and thoughtful about their choices. Initiatives like carbon labelling and carbon-based prices have certainly provided some of the information that all the surveys tell us consumers want about the sustainability of the food and drink they buy. Mindful of the gap When it comes to actual purchases, carbon neutral products lag behind other sustainable options. Only 17% of the 40,000 shoppers in our global survey said they had purchased a carbon neutral product recently; this compared to 33% who had chosen items marketed with \u2018sustainable packaging\u2019. We also found a disconnect: 64% of people said they\u2019re concerned about climate change, and 44% even think they\u2019re part of the problem; however just 17% are actually buying carbon neutral products. That\u2019s a big gap. Part of the problem here is that people might not fully understand what carbon neutral means (research by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK highlighted this confusion). Or perhaps they\u2019re sceptical about the difference that buying these products really makes. Then there\u2019s the ever-present issue of accessibility and affordability: 44% of global consumers consider the \u2018high price relative to non-sustainable alternatives\u2019 as the top barrier to buying these products, with \u2018unclear labelling\u2019 closely behind. So there\u2019s a mix of educational and practical barriers that might be holding people back from aligning their purchases with their concerns. So what happens next? Has scrutiny of the claims, by campaigners, consumers, regulators and companies themselves, derailed interest in carbon neutral claims forever? Brands are genuinely worried about being labelled as \u2018greenwashers\u2019, so with offsets under scrutiny companies are compelled to put the brakes on. Evian and Nestl\u00e9 are among those to be re-thinking their strategies, while Footprint has reported how foodservice companies like Leon, Sodexo and others are moving away from carbon neutral claims and targets. The Carbon Trust has also dropped its carbon neutral label used on almost 900 food and drink products, with the focus now on schemes and labels showing carbon reductions or comparisons between products. Carbon offsets are not a magic solution; we have seen in recent weeks how putting too much weight on them can actually backfire. In our research, we\u2019re spotting a slight slow down in the use of carbon neutral claims in food and even a decline in areas like staple foods and cooking ingredients and meals. However, it hasn\u2019t yet permeated industries such as beauty and personal care where the number of these claims continues to grow. It was also interesting to see carbon neutral claims made by Apple for some of its new products last month \u2013 and the criticism it is already receiving for this. Rise to reductions So, are companies better off focusing on emissions reductions? In a word: yes. The most climate neutral emissions are the ones you never produce in the first place. Companies are throwing money at different projects with all sorts of certifications to claim to be neutral \u2013 which sounds great (or used to sound great) \u2013 but it is hard to know which ones actually make a real impact or even know where these projects are happening or if they are affecting communities, food security or land prices. If companies are struggling to understand all this, how on earth are consumers supposed to? Regulators like the Competition and Markets Authority and ASA are of course hoping to tighten up the rules so shoppers can better understand what they are buying and then clarify any green claims being made. The intention is good \u2013 demands on companies to make it clear what and how many offsets are used can help to improve transparency, for instance. The new rules are also shaking up how companies talk about sustainability, including carbon, net-zero and carbon neutral. But the guidelines are frustratingly vague and leave room for interpretation. There is still too much uncertainty and above all companies want consumers to trust the brands they buy into. Whether they can do so when it comes to carbon neutral claims going forward, time will tell. Maria Coronado Robles is global head of sustainability insights at Euromonitor.","filter_flag":1}

According to the company, the new facility synergises taste expertise with strong ethical principles providing high-quality product ranges that also help empower its customers to make steps towards delivering more environmentally-friendly business operations. As the firm explained, its focus on taste and sustainability is revealed by findings from a recent Taste Tomorrow study, which highlights that while taste remains the primary purchasing criterion for consumers, the sustainability of the chocolate is a key differentiating factor for their purchase with 69% of UK respondents interested in food products coming from sustainable farming methods. \u201cBecolade\u2019s expansion is driven by its steadfast commitment to sustainability\u201d, according to Pierre Tossut, CEO of Puratos. \u201cOur brand drives innovation, ensuring that chocolatiers, p\u00e2tissiers, and bakers have access to exceptional chocolate choices that mirror their values,\u201d he says. \u201cOur new carbon-neutral factory embodies this commitment. This pioneering factory will operate on 100% renewable electricity \u2013 eliminating the need for fossil fuels. Thanks to extensive underground rainwater storage, it will source 90% of its water from collected rainwater. Belcolade has made substantial investments to enhance their energy efficiency, reliability, and resilience against droughts by revamping all technical energy installations, storage, and distribution. Thanks to heat recovery and the utilisation of cutting-edge heat pump technology, the brand\u2019s heat production process now consumes five times less energy than before.\u201d Moreover, as the business noted, the Cacao-Trace Sustainable Cocoa programme is another example of Belcolade\u2019s commitment to a more sustainable future throughout the entire cocoa chain. \u201cThe Cacao-Trace programme not only produce the best quality cocoa, but also supports farmers worldwide by providing better prices and an extra Chocolate Bonus. Additionally, we improve the environment and living conditions of our farmers\u2019 communities by building schools, health centres, and offering drinkable water equipment.\u201d explains Pierre Tossut. Alongside these impactful sustainable initiatives, Belcolade\u2019s new 100% recycle-ready packaging reflects the company\u2019s determination to reduce its environmental footprint and make a positive impact on the planet. \u201cOur planet is worth protecting, and we wish to play our part by applying these sustainable practices of which we are very proud,\u201d concludes Pierre Tossut. Furthermore, as the business noted, the product creations are born from collaborative efforts, crafted alongside chocolatiers, pastry chefs and bakers who remain attuned to the latest consumer trends. the brand has gained recognition for its innovation, using creative solutions and the latest technologies to provide unique tastes and high-standard Belgian chocolate to every single professional in the chocolate industry, reinforcing its commitment to providing the best experience to their customers. \u201cBelcolade combines sensory expertise and sustainability to craft quality products that drive our customers\u2019 success while securing a sustainable future for generations to come,\u201d remarks Youri Dumont, Director of the Chocolate Business Unit at Puratos. \u201cThe Cacao-Trace Sustainable Programme is a testament to our commitment to taste and sustainability. Our Cacao-Trace chocolate, which will be produced in part at the new site, takes taste to a whole new level of excellence thanks to a unique fermentation process that guarantees the best cocoa quality and enhances the flavours of every chocolate drop.\u201d Related content","filter_flag":1}

The target for all EU members is to achieve a 10% landfill rate by 2035. \u201cWaste-to-energy is an alternative to landfill and a final sink for waste that is not recyclable or reusable, thus fulfilling a hygienic task,\u201d explains Johnny Stuen. \u201cLandfills are dangerous places, whereas waste-to-energy in the EU is strictly regulated.\u201d Hazardous waste that needs immediate safe treatment as well as waste that cannot be recycled because of contamination or composition may find its way into a waste-to-energy plant. \u201cSome countries depend heavily on landfills and it should not be the first thing. But our goal is to get better at sorting, drive up the recycling rates and put everything that cannot be recycled in sanitary landfill. Of course, we aim to minimise landfill but it is preferable to incineration,\u201d argues Janek V\u00e4hk. One point on which both sides agree is that no recyclable waste should end up in an incinerator. The problem: too many recyclables end up in the residual waste and too much recyclable waste is not recycled as yet. \u201cI strongly advocate efficient source separation. This is essential for quality recycling. When we have to deal with mixed waste it\u2019s already too late,\u201d says Ella Stengler. Stuen agrees: \u201cWaste-to-energy is not the solution by itself. Good sorting systems are essential. And we need a lot more sorting technology so no recyclable waste ends up in an incinerator.\u201d A harmonised collection system might be helpful, according to Janek V\u00e4hk, \u201cbecause it is very confusing what to put in what bin.\u201d \u201cWaste-to-energy plants don\u2019t have an influence on what they get to burn. Therefore, legislation is needed. They cannot reduce the waste by themselves,\u201d says CEWEP\u2019s Ella Stengler. But of course, just because selective collection is compulsory in the EU, this doesn\u2019t mean that it is homogeneous throughout its territory. A concern expressed by the EU and NGOs alike is related to the design of the plants. Driving up recycling rates \u2013 and in the best case scenario, recycling innovation especially for plastics \u2013 will result in a smaller amount of residual waste and therefore less material that may end up in an incinerator. \u201cShould we significantly reduce waste generation, the waste-to-energy plants are flexible and can reduce their volume. But I wouldn\u2019t shut them down just yet,\u201d says Ella Stengler, also pointing to the change in waste that will be delivered to waste-to-energy plants in the future. \u201cWe will have less fossils in waste-to-energy thanks to better source separation. So more biogenic input and less fossil fuels will really make an impact.\u201d Another aspect Stengler stresses is independent heat production: \u201cEurope is highly dependent on fossil fuels. Waste-to-energy can supply energy and so on a local level replace other energy sources and thus make us a little less dependent on other countries.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The Cupertino, California-based company says transporting products around the world makes up about 9% of its comprehensive carbon footprint. The iPhone maker says it is shifting more product volume to shipping modes that are less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as ocean or rail. Apple\u2019s vast supply chain comprises more than 400 facilities across 180 regions in nearly 30 countries, stretching from the Austrian Alps to Vietnam\u2019s Mekong Delta, according to a recent report by Bloomberg. \u201cApple\u2019s carbon footprint methodology shows that shipping the same product by ocean emits 95% fewer emissions than by air,\u201d the company said. For its carbon neutral Apple Watch models, including watches and bands, Apple says it will ship at least 50% of the combined weight using non-air modes, which it claims will cut total transportation emissions nearly in half. Article continues below the advert Additionally, the packaging of all Apple Watch Series 9 and SE models has been redesigned for compactness, with a new, smaller shape that reportedly allows for 25% more devices per shipment. Thus far, only 2.8% of total US smartphone imports traveled by sea in the second quarter 2023, though that was up from 1.1% a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. \u201cWhile the latest phones may still need to be shipped by air to meet launch dates, earlier-generation equipment could be shipped by sea,\u201d it added. S&P Global Market Intelligence says the proportion of US laptop computer imports by all suppliers by sea has already returned to pre-pandemic levels after supply chain disruptions of the past two years. In the second quarter of 2023, 37.6% of US laptop computer imports arrived by sea, according to its data \u2014 the highest in over 10 years. \u201cThat may reflect efforts to cut costs in a low-demand environment. It does, however, reflect the off-peak season. In the third and fourth quarters of 2022, ahead of peak sales season, ocean shipments represented 16.6%,\u201d S&P Global Market Intelligence said. Apple\u2019s ambition is to make every product carbon neutral by the end of the decade, including the entire global supply chain and the lifetime use of every device Apple makes. The company says it is \u201ccommitted to supporting broader efforts to decarbonise shipping industries\u201d, such as by being a member of the First Movers Coalition. The coalition, unveiled during the COP26 climate conference in the UK city of Glasgow, aims to be a platform for companies to make purchasing commitments that demand low and zero-carbon fuels and technology.","filter_flag":1}

Belcolade has also committed to making all packaging materials across its operations fully recyclable by 2025. This move will further reduce the brand\u2019s environmental footprint and help customers take meaningful steps toward their sustainability goals. Inside Belcolade\u2019s carbon-neutral chocolate factory. Pic: Belcolade Youri Dumont, who leads the Belcolade business, outlined more details of the brand\u2019s sustainability journey to ConfectioneryNews and said, \u201cIts commitment to value creation is contributing to a better, brighter future for communities and the planet\u200b.\u201d Building trust through transparency \u200b Belcolade\u2019s Cacao-Trace sustainable cocoa programme has been designed to produce the best quality cocoa \u2013 thanks to a highly specialised fermentation process \u2013 and to protect the environment and add social value to communities worldwide. Dumont said one of the core aims of Cacao-Trace is to answer directly to the need for a more sustainable and transparent cocoa supply chain. Technical support and coaching, delivered on the farms and in Cacao-Trace post-harvest centres, helps cocoa farmers diversify their income, increase their yields, and improve the quality of their beans. By working alongside them to further professionalise their farm management skills, Cacao-Trace empowers cocoa farmers to obtain a substantial quality premium in addition to the farmgate price and to manage their farms with greater autonomy. Furthermore, he commented that farmers are trained in environmental protection techniques, such as agroforestry, to bring more biodiversity, better climate resistance, and new sources of income to communities. The programme also strives to fight against the imbalance in profit-sharing throughout the value chain. It does this by guaranteeing a premium price and an extra Chocolate Bonus of 10-euro cent per kg of chocolate sold, which accounts for two to five additional months of revenue. The Chocolate Bonus proceeds go to the farmers to increase their living income or implement meaningful community projects, such as building schools health centers, and offering drinkable water equipment. A brighter future on the horizon \u200b Since 2016, over \u20ac4.5 million ($4.78m) has been collected for Cacao-Trace cocoa farming communities in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mexico, Uganda, and Cameroon. The brand has also set its sights on a more ambitious future, with objectives including offering 100% sustainable cocoa by 2025, growing the Cacao-Trace community to 25,000 farmers by 2025, planting 3,440,000 trees by 2030, and reaching Living Income for all cocoa farmers by 2030. Achieving change \u2013 one carefully selected bean at a time\u200b As the Belgian Chocolate brand for professionals, Belcolade believes it has a responsibility to provide supply chain visibility, from harvesting to processing. Cacao-Trace cocoa is subject to a controlled separation process throughout the entire supply chain, which guarantees the physical traceability and governance of Cacao-Trace chocolate. \u201cThis high level of transparency benefits everyone. It helps to improve the lives of farmers, it means manufacturers can be confident in their claims, and it caters to consumers seeking sustainably sourced, superior-tasting chocolate\u200b,\u201d said Dumont. With the brand growing its global reach and branching out to make more factories carbon-neutral, Belcolade\u2019s Cacao-Trace sustainable cocoa programme is on track to becoming the trusted and sustainable supply partner of choice for chocolate and patisserie professionals, Dumont confirmed.","filter_flag":1}

Before going any further, we recommend that those who missed the earlier parts of this series take a look at our \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Hydrogen\u201d article for an overview of hydrogen energy and its characteristics. Hydrogen Energy 101: Experts Explain! Let's Talk Hydrogen In a nutshell, hydrogen (H\u2082) is unique in many ways. It does not emit any CO\u2082 when burnt, reacting chemically with oxygen (O\u2082) to produce only water (H\u2082O). The chemical reaction also releases energy so immense that it makes hydrogen a viable propellant for space rockets. Classed as secondary energy, hydrogen can be processed and converted from primary energy made from natural resources such as solar and wind, as well as fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal. In addition to the characteristics detailed in the image above, hydrogen boasts advantages over electricity and heat, its counterparts in secondary energy. While the former can be stored in batteries, they are limited in terms of capacity. Heat, meanwhile, is hard to maintain over time. In contrast, hydrogen can be stored for long-term use: It can be pre-produced, stored (e.g. after conversion from electricity), and used exactly as, when, and where required. Hydrogen offers many benefits, but in reality, there are many challenges that still need to be addressed, including infrastructure development, cost, and the production process itself. In the case of the latter, the usage of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, inevitably leads to the generation of CO\u2082. Hence, solutions must factor in raw materials, their potential emissions, and the overall process involved, with the three primary methods producing: \u201cGrey\u201d hydrogen \u2013 Made by deriving hydrogen from fossil fuels. \u201cBlue\u201d hydrogen \u2013 Made via methods that capture the CO\u2082 emitted in the production process, reducing atmospheric emissions. \u201cGreen\u201d hydrogen \u2013 Made by electrolyzing water using power generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Of the hydrogen produced worldwide today, 99% is grey hydrogen. As the world combats the climate crisis, the efficiency of producing green hydrogen becomes a vital component in building the foundation for a carbon-neutral society. Before achieving that, however, there first needs to be demand\u2014in other words, more established applications for hydrogen. SOEC: Redefining Hydrogen Production with Electricity DENSO has delved deep into R&D for alternative methods of hydrogen production as well as potential use cases. Amid this process, the company has planted its flag in the field of SOEC technology, a process which produces green hydrogen. So, what exactly drives R&D efforts for hydrogen at DENSO? Shuzo Oda, who is leading the development of SOECs at the Hirose Plant, says: \u201cRight now, the renewable energy required to produce green hydrogen is in limited supply. Costs are high, and in order to maximize the limited supply, we had to find ways to make the production process as efficient as possible.\u201d Before going any further, we should provide a brief overview of how water electrolysis works. The basic definition can be described as the process of producing hydrogen and oxygen by passing electricity through water, with methods that include the use of alkaline solutions, polymer membranes, and ceramic membranes. DENSO\u2019s Hirose Plant is currently testing SOEC with ceramic membranes. Oda:\u201cAlkaline solutions and polymer membranes react at low temperatures of about 60\u00b0C. This leads to a shorter start-up time, making them ideal for operations that are either intermittent or fluctuating by nature. Polymer membranes, in particular, are suitable for factories that rely on fast and flexible responses to leverage surplus renewable energy. We use these membranes for our water electrolysis system at DENSO Fukushima, as hydrogen demand often fluctuates in its operations. Unlocking the Potential of Local Hydrogen: Fukushima's Quest In contrast, the SOEC is an electrolysis system featuring a ceramic cell stack placed inside a hot module. The electrolysis process is facilitated by supplying water vapor and electricity. SOEC technology uses ceramic membranes to sustain the required temperatures, which range from 600\u2013800\u00b0C. While producing hydrogen this way entails a longer start-up time, its efficiency makes it suited for operations that are more stable by nature. The higher the temperature, the lower the voltage needed for the electrolysis process. As long as good ceramic materials with the right heat-resistant properties are used, we reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production, ensuring a stable output while expending less energy in the process.\u201d In short, if more hydrogen can be produced with less electricity through SOECs, the reduction in manufacturing costs will boost its appeal for a variety of applications. Testing for potential applications of this technology is now underway at the Hirose Plant. From this current fiscal year, DENSO has initiated the use of hydrogen in the manufacturing process of power cards, a component used in power control units (PCU) to regulate the flow of current between the battery and electric motor of a hybrid vehicle. Masayuki Satake, currently leading DENSO\u2019s in-house testing efforts, spoke with us about the benefits already seen in incorporating hydrogen into the production line. Satake:\u201cWe\u2019re using green hydrogen in the reflow soldering process when manufacturing power cards. The process involves melting solder paste to attach electrical components heated in ovens to their respective contact pads. Here, hydrogen plays an important role, as it removes any impurities on the surface of the solder. Another advantage of using hydrogen is that the thermal conductivity it provides is seven times that of nitrogen, an atmosphere gas* we use in reflow soldering. The magnitude of its thermal conductivity lets us reach the temperature we need in shorter periods of time.\u201d *Used to ensure proper soldering quality and prevent oxidation during the soldering process. DENSO has begun system tests using a prototype reflow oven, using it to manufacture power cards which are then evaluated in terms of quality and environmental safety. The company intends to scale up these tests to the factory level in FY2024, with eventual plans of boosting production line capabilities via full implementation. SOFC: A New Generation of Fuel Cells, Powered by Hydrogen Technology DENSO\u2019s Nishio Plant has also been busy with its own pet project since May 2023, testing the potential applications of hydrogen energy. The project aims to assess and evaluate the operations of an energy management system, which features the use of in-house developed SOFCs and combines other energy sources, including solar panels and storage batteries. Masahiro Ishimaru, currently in charge of the project, explains: \u201cWe developed a system that controls the amount of energy generated and stored in SOFCs based on forecast data for the weather and factory energy requirements. This will help us build a more efficient and stable energy supply while ensuring we cut CO\u2082 emissions.\u201d To provide more context, fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between fuels (including hydrogen) and oxygen. This process is not 100% efficient, however, as some energy is lost as heat in the process. The SOFCs used in DENSO\u2019s energy management system step in to utilize this waste heat, enabling significant reductions in CO\u2082 emissions. To learn more about these special features of SOFCs, we spoke with Yuki Mukohara, who is currently involved in their development. Mukohara:\u201cThere are several types of fuel cells, depending on the material used. For example, PEFCs use electrolytes made from resin membranes. These membranes react at about 100\u00b0C, allowing for a short start-up time. On the other hand, SOFCs use ceramic-based electrolytes. Ceramic membranes react at about 700\u00b0C. While they require a longer start-up time, they are also able to convert fuel into energy more efficiently using high-temperature waste heat. Given these properties, we\u2019re running tests to explore the feasibility of using the technology in applications where uninterrupted operations are key.\u201d SOFC\u2019s ability to operate at high temperatures also reveals a more overarching long-term benefit: its ability to contribute significantly to carbon neutrality. At present, city gas is the most widely used gaseous fuel. Heat is required to harvest hydrogen from the hydrocarbon fuels contained in city gas, and SOFCs can help achieve that by leveraging high internal temperatures to convert city gas to hydrogen efficiently. Mukohara:\u201cWhile hydrogen is growing in prominence as a viable energy source, we\u2019re still in a transition period. There are still cases in which it can\u2019t fully replace fossil fuels, mostly because of cost factors and convenience. Having said that, if we can leverage SOFCs to generate hydrogen through fuels like city gas, we can expect to see a significant cut in CO\u2082 emissions in terms of power generation and a big contribution to decarbonization efforts over the long term.\u201d Extending Hydrogen Technology\u2019s Reach Across the Globe DENSO is on a mission to become the world\u2019s first carbon neutral company, dedicated to fostering a more sustainable society. Its track record in mobility technology is underpinning its steady progress toward the establishment of a hydrogen-powered society, with its R&D initiatives in SOEC and SOFC providing a stepping stone to turn its mission into reality. Satake:\u201cWe want to formally introduce SOEC and SOFC to the rest of the world. But the first step toward that is to conduct in-house tests and integrate the technologies into our factory operations, establishing the technologies for both hydrogen production and application. When DENSO\u2019s hydrogen technologies are used in a variety of fields and applications, we\u2019ll be enabling Local Production for Local Consumption, where locally-produced hydrogen is consumed locally. If this model is adopted across Japan, we\u2019ll have the infrastructure to build a hydrogen-powered society, bringing us closer to the goal of carbon neutrality.\u201d DENSO\u2019s vision extends far beyond Japan\u2019s borders. Ishimaru, whose overseas tenure has spanned countries such as the UK and the US over a period of roughly 25 years, notes, \u201cAs a global company, DENSO has a part to play in using hydrogen technology to solve environmental issues, which are not limited to Japan. They concern the entire world. If we go back in time, the UK kickstarted the Industrial Revolution, a huge turning point for mankind that caused a complete shift in how we live and work. It also caused a new set of problems, mainly in the form of damaging the environment through an increase in CO\u2082 emissions. We, as a global society, are now facing the consequences of what began all that time ago. I believe it\u2019s our responsibility as a company to do what we can to leverage our technology and bring us on track to a more sustainable future.\u201d Forging the future with Japanese hydrogen technology. Armed with this passion and vision, DENSO continue their journey, one which may very well bring us closer to a truly carbon-neutral world.

Growing demand and the vulnerability of supply chains to disruption have resulted in the European Commission creating a list of critical raw materials (CRMs) for the EU, which is subject to a regular review and update. Climate Change and Environment Industrial Technologies \u00a9 senarce, Shutterstock CRMs cover all raw materials where they hold high importance to the EU economy and there is high risk associated with their supply. This Results Pack therefore showcases EU-funded projects spearheading research that will improve the processing of these raw materials and enhance its sustainability. The goal of the Critical Raw Materials Act proposed by the European Commission is to secure the EU\u2019s future supply of CRMs required for technologies such as renewable energy and battery power, by supporting the EU\u2019s self-reliance in mining, processing and recycling the 34 listed critical metals and minerals. These technologies play a pivotal role in Europe\u2019s green transition, which is aimed at making Europe the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050, and will help to deliver the European Green Deal. Focus on EU research The 12 projects in this pack offer concrete technological solutions for mineral processing resulting from Horizon 2020 funded research and innovation projects, covering a wide range of CRMs. These include rare earth elements, which are necessary for high-tech consumer products like cellular telephones, computer hard drives, electric and hybrid vehicles, and flat screen monitors and televisions. The research also demonstrates how - by implementing technological innovation - these raw materials and side streams may be recovered and reused, instead of being discarded as waste. Achieving CRM security Contributing to the circular economy in the construction arena, NEMO has demonstrated the potential for using mine tailings in concrete products, as well as recovering additional metals from sulfidic residues. Aluminium production yields a vast amount of bauxite residue and the RemovAL project converted this into new products, including substrate for road construction and building aggregates. Many rare earth elements are reluctant to be separated from their rock deposits, so optimisation of the extraction model is key. The SecREEts project extracted rare earth elements from phosphate rocks used in fertiliser production. Making use of steel waste streams, CHROMIC removed chromium for use in the high-tech sector. New methods devised by the FineFuture project separate mineral particles as small as 20 \u00b5m so that they are not discarded. PLATIRUS has strived to enable the recovery of enough valuable platinum from mining and electronic waste to fill the supply gap up to 30 %, making Europe more competitive. One of the costliest elements on the market is scandium and its supply has been limited to imports from Asia and Russia. The SCALE project aimed to establish a closed supply chain for this valuable metal used in high-intensity lighting and 3D printing applications. CROCODILE produced a first-of-its kind commercial metallurgical system based on advanced hydrometallurgical and electrochemical technologies able to produce cobalt metal from different waste streams such as spent batteries and catalysts. SUSMAGPRO developed and tested industrial-scale technologies for extracting rare earth neodymium from discarded items containing permanent magnets. ION4RAW pioneered a more efficient and eco-friendly way of extracting CRMs like cobalt, germanium and platinum group metals as primary resources. SisAl Pilot replaced carbon-rich materials with secondary aluminium sources such as end-of-life scrap and production side streams in silicon production. TARANTULA aimed to recover refractory metals, tungsten, niobium and tantalum, a group of metallic elements that are highly resistant to heat and wear, from low-grade waste by developing a suite of cost-effective, scalable and eco-friendly metallurgical processes.","filter_flag":1}

The lack of manufactures\u2019 commitment to introduce recycled material in new products and the growing imports from third countries are the main obstacles to the circularity of European plastic waste and to the development of the European recycling industry. On top of that, like numerous other industries, the recycling sector is not immune to the surrounding economic uncertainties and the ongoing inflation crisis. Hence, decisive, and bold policy measures are required to support one of Europe\u2019s key industries for transitioning to a circular and carbon-neutral economy. Setting mandatory recycled content targets has proven to be an effective and valuable tool to boost the uptake of recycled materials and increase the recycling capacities in Europe. Indeed, the recycling capacity witnessed a 17% growth in 2021 only in EU27+3 [1] and almost doubled over a 5-year period, with substantial investments and innovation accelerating in the sector. However, for the potential benefits of the recycled content mandate to materialize fully, it must be accompanied by robust mechanisms ensuring traceability, accurate accounting, and rigorous verification of recycled polymers. \u201cRecycling companies across Europe are investing in new equipment to both upgrade the recyclates and increase the recycling capacities. Our industry is taking its full share of the effort to the transition towards more circular and carbon-neutral plastic value chains. However, European plastic recyclers are currently operating well below their full capacity due to insufficient demand. This situation questions investments made by European recyclers to meet carbon-neutrality and circularity targets, as well as it questions recycler\u2019s future ability to invest more\u201d commented Sophie Sicard, President of EPRB, EuRIC\u2019s Plastics Recycling Branch. EuRIC calls for urgent measures to support plastics recycling in Europe: Implementation of pragmatic mandatory EU recycled content targets for plastics to stimulate demand for recycled materials and secure investments to scale up recycling capacity in Europe. Strong mechanisms for verification and traceability of recycled polymers, to protect the European recycling industry from unfair competition and fraudulent import. When quantifying recycled plastic content, mandatory third-party certifications are needed to preserve the transparency and credibility of the industry. Introduction of incentives, whether market or tax-based, to bridge the price gap between virgin and recycled plastics. For instance, fiscal incentives in the form of lower VAT rates for products made of recycled plastics can have a significant impact on stimulating recycling. Mandatory collection targets and design-for-recycling criteria to enhance the quantity and quality of inputs to recycling processes. The European plastic recycling industry faces a defining moment; either we recycle the challenges into opportunities or let our future go to waste. It\u2019s time to repackage commitment, shape bold policies, and recycle our way to a circular, carbon-neutral era.

The study by Cranfield University assessed the sustainability of remanufacturing by comparing the carbon emissions created through Circular Computing\u2019s remanufactured laptops, in comparison to brand new. It found that remanufactured laptops produce only 6.34% of the CO2 emissions against new products, highlighting the sustainable benefits of buying into the tech circular economy, in addition to the huge impact it can have on reducing the electronic waste (e-waste) crisis. This means that for every Circular Computing remanufactured laptop, approximately 316kg (700lb) of CO2 emissions are prevented by not buying new. For just 1,000 laptops, that is the same as taking 80 cars off the road for a year. Over recent years, e-waste accumulation has been on a steep rise, parallel with the technological evolution of electrical and electronic equipment. Companies such as Circular Computing have adopted a remanufacturing approach built in the circular economy to help overcome the emerging waste issue in the last couple of decades, where goods can return to manufacturers or remanufacturers and be re-used. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor report, the global level of e-waste increased from 41.8 MT in 2014 to 53.6 MT in 2022, which is then predicted to reach 74.7 MT by 2030. The authors of the study, Cranfield University, identified that the fast evolution speed and short lifetime of current electronics are rapidly contributing causes to the growing mountains of e-waste. Circular Computing\u2019s Circular Remanufacturing Process is the only one in the world to have been awarded a BSI Kitemark, which attests that the products are \u201cequal to or better than new\u201d. Remanufacturing has therefore emerged as the viable alternative to new when it comes to changing the outdated habits of \u2018take, make and replace\u2019 in the tech industry. The study defines Remanufacturing as \u2018a form of product recovery that allows an item like a laptop to be reused without being totally broken down and changed into something else\u2019. When going through the remanufacturing process, 99% of existing technology is re-used in the process, with the remaining 1% being recycled to be used as pallets for transportation. \u201cProfessor Mark Jolly, Director of Manufacturing and Materials, Cranfield University, comments: \u201cFor those in the manufacturing sector, finding ways to create products, and thereby extending the useful life of the materials used, while not harming the planet, has been an ever-growing challenge. With e-waste being one of the many accumulating waste streams from the past few decades, finding solutions to address this is necessary in a climate emergency. The findings from our study show that Circular Computing\u2019s revolutionary remanufacturing process is an important step in the right direction in tackling this issue once and for all.\u201d Steve Haskew, Head of Sustainability and Social Leadership at Circular Computing, adds: \u201cThis peer-reviewed scientific study by Cranfield University illustrates the profound impact that remanufacturing can have when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions in the technology industry. In an age of increased environmental consciousness and the growing issue of e-waste, finding a way to re-use the vast amounts of electronic products in existence should be a key task for the industry. \u201cWe believe that remanufacturing is the only solution to this problem to tackle the environmental issues while still ensuring a high performance, good as new end product. Studies like this one by Cranfield University will hopefully start to make a clear impression on the minds of IT leaders to reconsider their approach to purchasing technology\u201d. Circular Computing is on a mission to create a more ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible way to buy enterprise grade IT. While already offering a carbon neutral plus product, the Cranfield University study also identified further ways that the process could be made even more sustainable. Following the study, Circular Computing will be analysing its processes for transportation, use of renewable energy and packing\/recycling of packaging to ensure every stage of the remanufacturing journey is as sustainable as possible, remaining rooted in the circular economy.

Why Trust Us? I\u2019m going to be honest with you: When the first Apple Watch Ultra came out last year, I quickly decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019ve had an Apple Watch strapped to my wrist for the better part of the last decade, but the more rugged Ultra\u2014designed with endurance athletes, off-the-grid hikers, and scuba divers in mind\u2014didn\u2019t feel like a device that would fit my city-mouse, gym-rat lifestyle. But, when I got the chance to test out the new ($799), I\u2019ll be the first to admit that my first reaction to the wearable tech was wrong. The watch is bigger, faster, and built to withstand the elements\u2014features I\u2019ve found super useful in my day-to-day. Do I think an everyday athlete like me (and maybe you!) needs to splurge on the Ultra 2? Well, that depends. Read on to see which features I loved to help you decide. The Ultra 2 has Apple\u2019s brightest display yet. Apple The device\u2019s advanced display architecture can brighten up to 3,000 nits\u2014which makes it the brightest screen Apple has ever designed. To put that into perspective, 3,000 nits is 50 percent brighter than the first generation Apple Watch Ultra and 50 percent brighter than the recently-launched Series 9. This makes your watch readable in very harsh sunlight, so you\u2019ll never be squinting to see your stats on a hike or outdoor run. Case in point: I put it to the test at a Women\u2019s Health photo shoot in the California desert, and it allowed me to keep up with emails and texts while staying in the zone on our sunny set. Then, when the sun went down, the Ultra 2\u2019s new automatic Night Mode kicked in! If you spend a lot of time outside, this is a game-changer. And if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be inspired to get outdoors: With the latest watchOS 10 update, your Apple Watch can track how much time you\u2019re spending in sunlight every day. I dare you to check those stats and not head out for a hot girl walk. Extreme sports enthusiasts will geek out over the newest metrics. Apple I didn\u2019t get a chance to climb any mountains or go scuba diving during my watch-testing week, but Apple certainly made sure it was ready for anything. The company says the Ultra 2 was tested across the widest range of altitudes of any of their products\u2014all the way down to 500 meters below sea level and up to 9,000 meters up in the sky\u2014so you can use it while exploring all over. (The OG Ultra was only tested between sea level and 3,000 meters high.) Divers will especially dig the new features on this water resistant wonder, which includes up to 40 meters for recreational scuba diving. The Depth app can also now save a log from each session, including a GPS entry point, so you can look back on your dives either on Apple Watch Ultra 2 or iPhone. A new Modular Ultra watch face provides so much data. Apple One of the most noticeable differences between the Apple Watch Ultra and a standard Apple Watch is the case size: The Ultra 2 is the largest at 49mm, while the Series 9 comes in 45mm and 41mm options, and the new SE is available in an even smaller 44mm or 40mm. In doing so, the Ultra 2's modular watch face can creates room for even more complications\u2014the little icons and widgets. It also uses the outer edge of the display to show real-time data like seconds, altitude, or depth. Related Story The Best Apple Watch Cyber Monday Deals While the Ultra 2 may seem monster-sized compared to other models, it doesn\u2019t feel heavier on the wrist\u2014and the trade-off is having more info at a glance than ever before. As someone who wears a watch like this because I\u2019m a total data nerd (and use that data to keep tabs on my wellness habits), this both made my life easier almost immediately and genuinely brought me joy. These features will be available across Apple\u2019s entire slate of new watches: They are Apple\u2019s most powerful wearables yet. Apple The all-new S9 SiP watch chip enables the double tap gesture, which allows you to control the primary button on your Apple Watch by tapping your pointer finger and thumb together twice. (It will be available in a software update later this month.) Double tap has a ton of applications for daily life\u2014think answering a call or snoozing an alarm without having to touch your watch face. I got to test this more extensively on the Series 9, and I am totally convinced it will change your day-to-day life. You can read my thoughts on that here. Paired with a 4-core Neural Engine, Siri requests are now processed even faster\u2014all the magic is happening on your watch instead of being sent to the cloud and back. You can also use Siri to log and review health data, like your period or medications, privately and securely. These are Apple\u2019s first carbon-neutral products. Apple drastically reduced the carbon footprint of the Ultra 2, Series 9, and SE this time around as part of Apple 2030, the company\u2019s commitment to making every product carbon neutral by the end of the decade. When paired with an or , you\u2019ll be wearing 95 percent recycled titanium. The new , my personal fave, also has sustainability in mind, with a one-of-a-kind speckled pattern made from flakes of recycled bands. (All of the new Nike bands are available September 22.) The watchOS 10 update is the real star of the show. Apple All Apple Watch users with a Series 4 or later will be able to benefit from this latest update. The new (and, if I must say, epic) features allow you to: Add more self-care into your day. With the State of Mind feature in the Mindfulness app, you can log your daily mood and feelings and what may be contributing to it by reacting to a series of dynamic shapes.

Level up your cycling sessions. A cycling workout on your watch will now show up as a Live Event on your iPhone. Mount your phone to your bike to view your heart rate, elevation, and speed on-the-go. You can also connect your Apple Watch to Bluetooth cycling accessories, like power meters, speed sensors, or cadence sensors.

You can also connect your Apple Watch to Bluetooth cycling accessories, like power meters, speed sensors, or cadence sensors. Explore safer. The Compass app will auto-generate new cellular connectivity waypoints, so you can find the fastest route to check a text or make an emergency SOS call\u2014ASAP. The Compass app will auto-generate new cellular connectivity waypoints, so you can find the fastest route to check a text or make an emergency SOS call\u2014ASAP. Make reading maps easier. Elevation view lets you view waypoints in 3D, and Apple Maps\u2019 topographic map shows contour lines, elevation, and points of interest. Use it to search for nearby trails and choose one that fits your fitness level. So, do you need the Apple Watch Ultra 2? If you\u2019re an adventurer who hikes, climbs, or dives, the extra depth and altitude data\u2014paired with 36-hour battery life and super-bright screen\u2014make the Ultra 2 a game-changer for the activities you love. However, if you\u2019ve already got the original Ultra, you can probably skip this version. But for a regular city kid like me\u2026it depends. Most exciting new elements (double tap, anyone?) are available on all three new products, so the less expensive Series 9 ($399) or SE ($299) get the job done. That said, if you\u2019re rocking a wearable because you\u2019re a total data nerd, the Ultra 2 is undoubtedly the best of the best. And now that the double tap gesture is available, the device's efficiency will skyrocket. Amanda Lucci So...it depends on your lifestyle and your \u201cwhy.\" But for those planning on upgrading your Apple Watch this year anyway, I say, take the plunge! Its rugged durability makes it a worthwhile investment, especially now that it bears the new carbon-neutral seal. You just may feel inspired to put all this data to the test yourself.","filter_flag":1}

In 2020, Puratos began collaborating with Tosca, a global leader in reusable plastic packaging and performance pooling solutions, to design, test, and implement a solution that would eliminate single-use packaging and improve operational efficiency. To date, the partnership has driven the following operational and sustainability benefits: By switching to Tosca\u2019s CR1-pallets, Puratos now uses high-quality, clean, and sustainable plastic pallets, which has helped improve safety and reduce product damage. In addition, Puratos has benefited from using Tosca\u2019s pool of Superior Hybrid IBCs for liquids and Magnum Optimum containers for dry bulk products. These solutions have not only supported aseptic filling, but have also helped reduce Puratos\u2019 emissions, resource consumption, and exposure to volatile pricing of plastic one-way packaging. Moreover, Tosca and Puratos have worked together to reduce food waste by innovating ways to maximise product extracted from a container\u2019s liner. By trialling a combination of the Superior Hybrid Containers, a 1000-litre liner, and the right squeeze machine, Puratos has been able to significantly reduce the residue of highly viscous and thick products, resulting in less than 0.3% waste. Positive Sustainability Impact Given their joint commitment to sustainability, Tosca conducted a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to compare the environmental impact of Puratos\u2019 previous solution with the new pooling solution put in place by Tosca. It involved collecting and analysing data on the inputs, outputs, and environmental impacts of each solution. Puratos were then presented with the full analysis certificate that highlighted the savings for a number of key environmental metrics. Based on 2022 volumes, switching to Tosca\u2019s pooled plastic CR1 and foldable Magnum Optimum and Superior Hybrid IBCs saves 87 MT CO2 equivalent (the same as 213,028 passenger vehicle miles), 1,661 Gj of fossil fuels and 31,461 M3 of water. \u201cPartnering with Tosca is the perfect way to achieve our sustainability goals. We worked with Tosca and our customers to convert our existing packaging solution to Tosca\u2019s returnable containers. This has been a great success as we have a more sustainable solution and reduced our costs.\u201d- H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamand, sustainability manager Sourdough and Grains. The Future \u201cThe future of Tosca for me is that we will be collaborating even more. Today some products are not produced on Tosca pallets which should be changed in the future. I also hope that we will be able to send the Tosca pallets to even more countries around the world because that would facilitate our operations by having one pallet type we can use everywhere.\u201d- Vincent Holbrechts, logistics manager. With a shared commitment to innovation and sustainability, Puratos and Tosca are both looking to develop and grow the relationship further. As close partners, they will continue to collaborate and develop new, sustainable solutions that not only deliver cost savings and operational efficiencies but also safeguard the future for forthcoming generations. \u201cFor me, Tosca is Customer-centric, Solution-oriented, and Committed.\u201d \u2013 Alexis Rasp\u00e9, group purchasing manager for Packaging.

Known for its salads and grain bowls, the brand is leaning into growing consumer demand for minimally processed and sustainably sourced food. Starting tomorrow, all 221 of Sweetgreen\u2019s locations will feature ingredients cooked only in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). The ingredients in its warm grain bowls like the tofu- and mushroom-based Shroomami and salads such as the Super Green Goddess containing black lentils and chickpeas will all switch sunflower oil for the unrefined olive oil. The company is leaning into calls for more \u2018natural\u2019, less processed food \u2013 23% of Americans associate healthy food with minimal processing, according to a 1,023-person survey by the International Food Information Council (IFIC), while over three-quarters consider whether a food product is processed before buying it. Meanwhile, environmental sustainability is a purchase driver for a third of consumers (although that\u2019s down from 40% last year), something Sweetgreen is also doubling down on. In 2021, the salad chain pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2027, saying it would cut half of its footprint through a plant-forward menu and more sustainable sourcing decisions. This latest move falls in the latter category, continuing the company\u2019s commitment towards using high-quality, locally produced and minimally processed ingredients. Focusing on sustainable sourcing over health credentials Courtesy: Sweetgreen Sweetgreen is partnering with brands that have shared commitments to sustainable farming, choosing the Bari Olive Oil Company as its EVOO supplier. Running since 1936, it\u2019s one of the US\u2019s oldest olive oil companies. All of its EVOO is domestically grown and produced in California, using what it claims are organic and sustainable practices. Bari mills its olives \u2013 a drought-friendly crop \u2013 within 24 hours of harvest and uses every part of the fruit, including the pomace (ground pit and meat usually discarded) for cattle feed and the water used during milling for irrigating its trees. Meanwhile, at its 17 Texas locations, Sweetgreen is collaborating with Texas Olive Ranch, a fourth-generation family producing cold-pressed olive oil. \u201cReimagining fast food goes beyond the kitchen and starts with a strong, transparent supply chain. In addition to partnering with suppliers and growers we trust, we take into account how every ingredient is prepared, down to the oil it\u2019s cooked in,\u201d said Sweetgreen co-founder and chief concept officer Nicolas Jammet. Many seed oils have been found to be highly toxic and inflammatory, and labelled as \u201cthe most unhealthy staple of the American diet\u201d. Given EVOO\u2019s health credentials \u2013 it\u2019s an oil rich in anti-inflammatory substances, known to lower blood pressure and enhance blood vessel health, and has been linked with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s and some forms of cancer \u2013 it\u2019s perhaps surprising that Sweetgreen isn\u2019t centring its messaging on the nutritional benefits of the fat. Many companies \u2013 like Beyond Meat \u2013 are going all-in on the health aspects of new products to appeal to consumers \u2013 the IFIC report revealed that health is a key purchase driver for 62% of Americans. It\u2019s a much-discussed subject in the US, due to the alarming and rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes: over two-thirds (69%) of its citizens are overweight and 36% are obese. Innovations in fat and oil alternatives Courtesy: Sweetgreen In addition to the use of EVOO, Sweetgreen is exploring avocado oil as another cooking oil for its menu. In August, the company released a red wine vinaigrette dressing made with an avocado oil base, which it says became \u201can instant fan favourite\u201d. The dressing is now a permanent menu item in custom bowls and signature salads. \u201cWhile we know there\u2019s more work to do, we hope this change raises the bar and continues to inspire our industry to make quality products more accessible,\u201d said Jammet. The move follows a pilot by fellow fast-casual chain Shake Shack, which is trialling Californian startup Zero Acre Farms\u2019 sustainable Cultured Oil on select menu items at two NYC locations. Shake Shack too pointed to the oil\u2019s health and eco credentials: it\u2019s rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and boasts a 90% smaller environmental footprint than conventional vegetable oil. More and more companies are innovating in this space to develop oils and fats better for both people and the planet. Austrian startup Kern Tec upcycles fruit pits into oil for alt-dairy products, Germany\u2019s Zayt Bioscience turns fruit waste into precision-fermented butter, San Francisco-based Lypid has created a proprietary PhytoFat for plant-based meat, and Sweden\u2019s Mycorena makes fermented fungi-based fat to replace animal fats. Many brands are coming up with palm oil substitutes for use in both food and other applications. This includes Estonian startup \u00c4io, UK-based Clean Food Group, New York\u2019s C16 Biosciences and Dutch company NoPalm Ingredients.","filter_flag":1}

Both Singh and Ganeshan previously worked together at Wayfair. Their entrepreneurial foray is based on their learnings from their experience at the American ecommerce company where they worked on creating sustainable product categories. \u201cIt was during this time that we realized the significant gap for eco-friendly everyday essentials. Consumers were looking for products that weretrustworthy, affordable and available everywhere and no company was solving for this at scale,\u201d Singh told Entrackr. To make this happen, Singh took the plunge by quitting his job, selling his house in New York, and relocating to India. EcoSoul sells sustainable products through its website, ecommerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon, and also offline through partner stores. The catalog includes tableware, kitchenware, and compost bags. These products are made from using sustainable materials like palm leaves, bamboo, sugarcane bagasse, and PLA. Singh said the company currently offers 43 product varieties and 1,800 SKUs. The Delhi-based startup has already raised nearly $15 million in two rounds of funding and has backing of investors like Accel. It\u2019s worth noting that sustainability has become a lucrative market with industry-wide aspirations of becoming carbon neutral and support ecofriendly products and services. The global green technology and sustainability market size was valued at $15.85 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 22.7% from 2023 to 2030, according to a research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation with Singh: Who is your target audience? In terms of target users, at the heart of EcoSoul\u2019s audience are women between the ages of 25 and 45. Zooming out, our focus also extends to families, Millennials and Gen Z, who are inherently attuned to global issues and recognize that even small actions can yield substantial impacts. This demographic is particularly receptive to our mission. What is your business model? How do you make profits? Our business model at EcoSoul revolves around offering a range of everyday essentials crafted from sustainable materials like palm leaves, bamboo, sugarcane bagasse, and PLA. We\u2019re committed to providing eco-conscious consumers with accessible and environmentally friendly alternatives. In terms of profitability, we generate revenue through the sale of these products. Our pricing structure is designed to balance affordability with the costs associated with sustainable production methods. By maintaining a focus on quality and sustainability, we\u2019ve been able to establish a solid customer base that appreciates the value and positive impact of our offerings. This, in turn, allows us to reinvest in the business, expand our product line, and further our mission of promoting sustainable living. Can you share any growth figures? EcoSoul started out with an initial investment of Rs 4 crores back in August 2020. And, within just three years of our launch, we have a global turnover of more than Rs 300 crore. Moreover, EcoSoul has also secured Rs 125 crore in two funding rounds heldbetween 2021 and 2022. Every product that EcoSoul has in the market for more than a year is profitable. At the company level, we aim to hit profitability in 2024 given 2023 was near to launching more than 20 new products and 4 new countries. How do you plan to expand your business? What new services do you plan to add? We\u2019re gearing up to unveil PLA or a cornstarch-based product category. Think of it as the next level in eco-friendly materials. From PLA cups to PLA straws, we\u2019re talking about 100% plastic-free, tree-free options that are completely compatible with our planet-friendly ethos. EcoSoul is also committed to bringing more innovative products to the market like fully compostable diapers and sanitary pads early next year. But that\u2019s not all. We\u2019re also in the works for another exciting category: paper bamboo products. Picture wet wipes, facial tissues, and more, all designed to be both sustainable and accessible. And, of course, affordability is a key factor in all these endeavors.","filter_flag":1}

These two words summed up his philosophy of continually pushing forward, no matter what difficulties or challenges cross your path. Humanity cannot afford to lose any of the ground it has gained in terms of resolving the Earth's problems, and past approaches are simply no longer good enough. It is critical to accelerate our activities targeting the SDGs, making sure our movements are always forward, aiming for those goals with increasing momentum. Private enterprise must directly engage society to work closely together in creating new value for our world. Placing CO2 Absorbers Inside Vending Machines Since opening in 2012, Tokyo Skytree has attracted over 40 million visitors from both across Japan and around the world. Recently, the tourist attraction became the site for vending machines with a green edge. In July 2023, Asahi Soft Drinks Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Asahi Group Holdings, began installing vending machines that absorb atmospheric CO2. The project is a trial experiment for carbon recycling technology. The empty space behind the beverage outlet provides room for the installation of a mix of special materials capable of absorbing this greenhouse gas. As the beverage dispenser draws in the surrounding air for heating or cooling the drinks inside, it simultaneously captures carbon dioxide. The annual amount of this emissions gas that a single machine can sink is roughly the same as 20 adult cedar trees (around 56 \u2013 60 years old). Asahi's \"CO2-gobbling\" vending machine in Tokyo Skytree The company is also considering how to use the collected carbon dioxide to produce industrial products. One idea for a possible recycling application is mixing the materials rich in carbon dioxide with fertilizer for spreading on soil. Manufacturing artificial reefs as homes for kelp to revitalize the \"blue carbon\" marine ecological system is another potential use. The experiment will mainly focus on Tokyo and Osaka, installing about 30 of the trial machines in these major cities. The special material is easy to introduce as it fits into free space inside the current designs being used. The ease of retrofitting means it should be possible to install the systems inside all 2.2 million vending machines across Japan. Such \"carbon-gobbling\" drinks machines are a steady step toward creating a better world. Asahi Group will continue offering society new products, working together to consider and implement the best ways to realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a global enterprise, Asahi Group is positioned to effectively leverage top-tier know-how from around the world. The Netherlands' Koninklijke Grolsch N.V. , a beer brewery acquired by the Asahi Group in 2016, uses the thermal energy from biomass power generation to slash annual carbon dioxide emissions by 72 percent at its factories using natural-gas fired heating. The thermal energy is used for low-temperature pasteurization, washing of bottles and plastic cases, as well as heating for buildings. Employees around the world working for the Asahi Group share a common belief in the SDGs. A united standpoint defined in the Asahi Group Philosophy (AGP) developed to bolster the sustainable growth of corporate value. Koninklijke Grolsch won the Grand Prix at the AGP Awards for its innovative program.

Brands need to view digital and more traditional media channels as complementary to each other, rather than falling into the trap of viewing them as either\/or, according to Yorkshire Tea\u2019s marketing director Dom Dwight. \u201cIt\u2019s a mad suggestion that it should be an \u2018or\u2019 conversation, rather than an \u2018and\u2019 conversation,\u201d he said, speaking at Marketing Week\u2019s Festival of Marketing 2023 yesterday (5 October). During the panel, which was conducted in partnership with Kantar, Dwight acknowledged that over the past few years Yorkshire Tea has built its success through brand campaigns primarily on TV, through its \u2018Where Everything\u2019s Done Proper\u2019 campaign. However, part of the brand\u2019s success has been activating across a number of channels, including those online. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a sort of brand universe with Yorkshire Tea, which you usually feel when you watch on TV, but you also feel that when you watch a piece of content online,\u201d he said. The brand\u2019s use of its distinctive assets and its sense of humour across its media helps it maintain consistency while being able to tweak its tone of voice for different channels. Yorkshire Tea deploys its channels in slightly different ways, Dwight said. When the brand achieved carbon-neutral status, for example, it used YouTube to reach consumers who might be more engaged by this green messaging, he said. The combination of this smaller scale messaging and Yorkshire Tea\u2019s big brand campaigns on TV creates a \u201cwonderful synergy\u201d for consumers on the receiving end of both messages, he said. It\u2019s a mad suggestion that it should be an \u2018or\u2019 conversation, rather than an \u2018and\u2019 conversation. Dom Dwight, Yorkshire Tea On the Beach CMO Zoe Harris agreed on the importance of using both digital and more traditional media such as TV. She added that it was easy to fall into the trap of thinking in an \u201ceither\/or\u201d way. When asked whether digital media reached maturity as a brand building channel, she said: \u201cI think the real skill is to work out how you use both to do different jobs that complement each other.\u201d The biggest change in the digital advertising space has been that the channels themselves have changed, Harris said. The rise of short-form video, for example, has allowed On the Beach to be \u201cmore reactive\u201d to things online. The brand ensures it grounds this in points about it products. Harris gave the example of educational \u201cmyth-busting\u201d the brand posted on TikTok in the wake of the Turkey earthquakes to reassure travellers about the safety of the destination. \u201cAs digital changes it gives us new opportunities,\u201d she said, adding it gives marketers \u201canother string to [their] bow\u201d. There\u2019s certainly no set ratio for how brands should split their media spend between digital and more traditional channels, said Virgin Media O2 head of marketing performance Chris Love. The brands under the Virgin Media O2 banner, although in the same broad sector, have different ratios of where media spend falls, he noted. The company uses econometrics to analyse the effectiveness of its spend and work out how it will spread its media budget. This is a process that \u201cshould never stop\u201d to ensure this budget is most effectively deployed across digital and traditional channels, he said.","filter_flag":1}

To determine which countries are pioneering a new era of sustainability by taking on environmental responsibility, the DriveElectric team decided to take a deep dive into the most eco-conscious nations. DriveElectric reveals the nations making the most impressive strides in fostering green habits by looking at various factors, such as the countries that use the most renewable energy, EV sales, and solar panels. In addition, they shed light on the nations putting environmentally friendly innovative strategies at the forefront of global consciousness. DriveElectric also explores countries addressing environmental issues the fastest and those that have embraced the green movement, moving towards a brighter, more sustainable future. The greenest countries in the world 1. Sweden Green score \u2013 7.66\/10 Known as one of the most sustainable countries in the world, Sweden takes first place as the greenest country. The country has several low carbon dioxide emissions and strong renewable energy programs, which are contributing towards the country\u2019s goal of becoming fossil fuel-free and running solely on 100% renewable energy by 2045. 2. Finland Green score \u2013 7.03\/10 Regarded as having a strong reputation as a leader in environmental policy and sustainable development, Finland comes second, scoring 7.03 out of 10. Committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2035, the country\u2019s renewable energy sources account for around 40% of end consumption and continue to focus on curbing industrial emissions and protecting its biodiversity. The Nordic country has one of the most stringent environmental policies, with an Environmental Policy Stringency Index (EPS) index of 4.11 out of 6. 3. Germany Green score \u2013 6.55\/10 Germany is the third greenest country with a score of 6.55 out of 10. According to the country\u2019s Climate Protection Act, it aims to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045. Germany also has high hopes, with an ambitious goal of running on 100% green power by 2035. Regarding recycling, the nation is said to be a world leader in recycling over 60% of its waste into new products such as paper and glass or fuel. Countries with the best environmental policies 1. France EPS Index: 4.89\/6 When it comes to the country with the best environmental policies, France takes the crown with an EPS index of 4.89 out of 6. The EPS index considers the degree of stringency of 13 environmental policy instruments related to climate and air pollution. Considered a world leader in sustainable initiatives, the French parliament passed a climate change bill in 2021 to reduce packaging waste, prohibit open-air terrace heaters and prevent future airport expansions. 2. Switzerland EPS Index: 4.50\/6 Ranking in second place is Switzerland, with an EPS index of 4.50 out of 6. Said to be one of the world\u2019s most eco-friendly countries, Switzerland was the first country to vote for implementing a green economy. In recent years, there have been measures taken by the Swiss Confederation to achieve a more sustainable environment. Nearly 60% of the country\u2019s electricity comes from hydropower and reduced emissions from furnaces, industrial and commercial operations, as well as combustion engine-driven machinery. This has had a positive impact on the country\u2019s air quality. 3. Luxembourg EPS Index: 4.22\/6 Regarded as a pioneer in sustainable activities, Luxembourg is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. On a national scale, the country\u2019s objective is to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Luxembourg has several sustainable initiatives, including promoting electric cars and bikes, package-free fruit and vegetables, and its own eco-village. With so many green initiatives in place, it is no surprise that Luxembourg ranks third with an EPS index of 4.22 out of 6. Countries that use the most renewable energy 1. Denmark Percentage of renewable energy consumption: 40.3% A leading country in renewable energy production and usage, it is no surprise that Denmark takes the lead with a renewable energy consumption of 40.3%. In 2022 alone, an estimated three-quarters of the country\u2019s electricity generation was collectively produced from renewable energy sources. By 2030, it is estimated that these renewable sources will provide 100% of the nation\u2019s electric power production. 2. Finland Percentage of renewable energy consumption: 21.6% Ranking in second place is Finland, with 21.6% renewable energy consumption in 2021. A global leader in producing second-generation biofuels, some of the country\u2019s most important forms of renewable energy include bioenergy, hydroelectric power and wind power. By 2030, Finland aims to increase its use of renewable energy to more than 50% of its end-consumption. 3. Sweden Percentage of renewable energy consumption: 21.5% Sweden takes third place with an estimated 21.5% renewable energy consumption. Seeking a greener future, the Swedish government has set ambitious targets for sustainability. This includes using 100% renewable energy and going fossil-free by 2045. With the increase in the nation\u2019s green activities over the years, Sweden is getting closer to its net zero target. In fact, in 2021, Sweden saw an increase of nearly 70% in EV sales, significantly reducing the country\u2019s carbon footprint. Countries with the highest solar power consumption 1. Australia Percentage of solar power consumption: 11.66% Australia grabs first place as the country with the highest solar panel consumption, with 11.66% of its energy coming from solar panels. The adoption of solar power is fast-growing in the country. It is also the fastest-growing generation type, with more than 30% of Australian households having a rooftop solar PV, which equates to a combined capacity exceeding 11 GW. 2. Hungary Percentage of solar power consumption: 10.61% Hungary takes second place with a solar power consumption of 10.61%. Thanks to government support and declining system prices, solar power in Hungary has experienced rapid advancement. In recent years, the country launched its largest solar power plant to date, which is expected to account for 8% of the total domestic solar-generated electricity. 3. Spain Percentage of solar power consumption: 9.85% Completing the top three countries with the highest solar power consumption is Spain with 9.85%. The country is considered a world leader in solar power production. Spain\u2019s solar power capacity is expected to see strong growth as its energy strategy could accommodate an additional 65 GW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity installation by 2030. Countries with the highest hydroelectricity consumption 1. Norway Percentage of hydroelectricity consumption: 65.9% Well known for abundant natural lakes and steep valleys, Norway\u2019s topography lends itself nicely to hydropower development. In 2021, hydroelectricity accounted for 65.9% of the total Norwegian power production, while the remainder came from thermal and wind energy. The Scandinavian country is committed to reducing emissions by at least 40 % by 2030. 2. Switzerland Percentage of hydroelectricity consumption: 31.8% Switzerland currently has a whopping 682 hydroelectric power stations with a capacity of over 300 kilowatts. Hydropower is a cornerstone of Switzerland\u2019s energy policy. In 2021, 31.8% of its electricity came from hydroelectricity, making it one of the country\u2019s most important domestic sources of renewable energy. 3. Sweden Percentage of hydroelectricity consumption: 29.4% As Sweden\u2019s most significant renewable energy, in 2021, hydroelectricity accounted for just under 30% of Swedish electricity generation. Together with nuclear power, hydropower is said to be the foundation of the country\u2019s electricity system. Hydropower in Sweden operates on zero carbon emissions, and the water used is returned to the river after leaving the turbine. Countries with the highest nuclear energy consumption 1. France Percentage of nuclear energy consumption: 36.5% With one of the world\u2019s most extensive nuclear power programs, it is no surprise that France tops the list, with over a third (36.5%) of its energy consumption coming from nuclear power. In 2021, nuclear power plants in France generated an estimated 361 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. This accounted for more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s annual electricity generation, the highest nuclear generation share in the world. 2. Sweden Percentage of nuclear energy consumption: 21.1% In 2021, nuclear energy provided an estimated 21.1% of the country\u2019s electricity. Sweden currently operates on six reactors located at three different sites that supply almost a third of its electricity, with hydroelectricity providing most of the rest in its fossil-free energy mix. 3. Slovakia Percentage of nuclear energy consumption: 19.7% Slovakia has a combined net power capacity of 2,308 MWe with five operational nuclear reactors. The country also has the potential to build a new nuclear reactor as electricity consumption continues to increase. In 2021, Slovakia\u2019s nuclear energy consumption was almost a fifth (19.7%) of its primary energy. Countries with the highest increase in EV sales 1. India YoY percentage difference: 300% Unlike China, Europe and the US, India is not a hub for purchasing electric cars. However, the country\u2019s demand for electric vehicles skyrocketed by 300% in just one year. EV sales in the South Asian country were four times higher than in 2021 after almost hitting 50,000 battery electric vehicle sales in 2022. 2. Brazil YoY percentage difference: 193% Brazil follows behind with a year-on-year increase of 193% in EV sales. The country\u2019s adoption of electric vehicles has seen steady growth over the last few years. Compared to 2021, which saw an estimated 2,900 EV sales, Brazil\u2019s demand for electric cars rose to 8,500 by 2022. 3. New Zealand YoY percentage difference: 179% Due to the increasing environmental awareness of the global climate crisis, the New Zealand government introduced the \u201cclean car\u201d rebate scheme in 2021, which allows buyers of new or used, low or zero-emissions vehicles to claim back up to $8,000 (NZ) of the price. The scheme\u2019s popularity has led to an increase of 179% in EV sales, a record high. Electric car sales went from 6,800 in 2021 to 19,000 new purely electric vehicles registered in the country. Countries with the highest railway usage 1. China YoY percentage difference: 946,499 China takes first place with the highest railway usage of 946,499 million passenger kilometres in 2021. Railways play a significant role in passenger travel in the country. China\u2019s railroad network also saw an increase of 2.5% in the same year. The country\u2019s railroad network has increased by 65% in over a decade. 2. Japan YoY percentage difference: 263,211 In second place is Japan, with 263,211 million passenger kilometres in 2020. Research suggests that around 40% of the total passenger travel in Japan is by railway transport. This is significantly more when compared to other countries, such as the United States, which is said to have 90% of people opting for road transport. 3. India YoY percentage difference: 321,126 India ranks third with 231,126 million passenger kilometres. This is unsurprising as the South Asian country has the fourth-largest rail network in the world. According to the research, India saw an average of 22.15 million passengers use the Indian Railways network daily between 2019 and 2020. Methodology To find out which countries have fostered the greenest habits, Driveelectric looked at various factors, including the percentage of renewable energy consumption, rail transport of passengers, EV sales, percentage of solar power consumption, target percentage of emissions reduction and Environmental Policy Stringency (EPS) Index. To calculate the overall green score of each country, DriveElectric looked at over 30 countries. For the countries missing at least one or two factors, they put a 0 for their missing factors. They then used a weighted ranking system to calculate an overall average, which was then ranked to determine the country with the highest green score. Using a Net Zero Tracker, Driveelectric collected data on each country\u2019s Net Zero goals. By looking at the 2023 scorecard, they ranked each country based on their target percentage of emissions reduction. Please note that they only looked at countries with available data for most of the other factors, so this list is not ranked on every country\u2019s sustainability goals. The EPS Index was taken from OECD. This measures the stringency of environmental policy across different countries. To source data for more countries, DriveElectric used CEIC data. The index is based on the degree of stringency of 13 environmental policy instruments, from climate to air pollution. The index also ranges from 0 (not stringent) to 6 (highest degree of stringency) and covers 40 countries. We used the most recent data, which was from 2020. DriveElectric sourced data from BP\u2019s Statistical Review of World Energy to determine which countries have the highest renewable energy consumption. Using figures of each country\u2019s renewable consumption in exajoules (input-equivalent, p.43), they calculated this as a percentage of each country\u2019s primary energy consumption (p.8) in 2021 to determine how much of the consumed energy is renewable. This was also done for hydroelectricity (p.42) and nuclear energy (p.41). They sourced data on the countries with the most solar energy by calculating the solar capacity (p.45) compared to its total electricity generation (p.50) to get the percentage of the total energy consumption from solar energy. To find out which nations saw the most increase in EV Sales year-on-year (2021-2022), DriveElectric used historical data from a Global EV Data Explorer. The figures used were filtered by Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). We only took into account countries; e.g. data for \u2018Other Europe\u2019 and \u2018Rest of the world\u2019 were not considered due to being too broad. Using Eurostat, they gathered data on the rail transport of passengers in each country. DriveElectric used figures from the World Bank to source data for non-European countries. This was measured based on the passenger kilometres in millions. These figures were then ranked in order using the most recent data available for each country. Data collection for all the above sections was completed on 04\/09\/2023.","filter_flag":1}

The report, now in its 12th year and produced in partnership with Zebra Technologies, is based on interviews with 44 retail leaders and provides an inside perspective on the strategic conversations happening right now in the UK\u2019s retail boardrooms. The retail bosses interviewed were keen to detail their plans to become greener and the targets they have set to reduce the impact their operations have on the planet. In particular, eBay, Osprey London and The Fragrance Shop placed sustainability in their top three priorities list for 2024, while reaching Net-Zero by 2040 is central to THG\u2019s strategy. Many of the leaders interviewed are already supporting the BRC Climate Action Roadmap, which has now signed up around 90 businesses to work together and learn from each other to reduce carbon emissions and improve the long-term health of the planet. Sustainability appointments are becoming a regular feature of the news cycle. The White Company hired Cat Lee as head of ethics and sustainability in July 2023; Decathlon\u2019s former head of outdoor Chris Allen moved into the director of sustainability role in June 22; while Asos appointed sustainability and CSR expert Anna Maria Rugarli as non-executive member and chair of its ESG board in June 2023 to oversee its green strategy. eBay: championing the circular economy At eBay, the retailer\u2019s focus is on driving the pre-loved market. In recent years, the marketplace has retrospectively rebranded itself as a \u201cpre-loved pioneer\u201d as consumer interest has grown and the reputation of the secondhand market has improved. Since 2022, eBay has been the main fashion sponsor for the hit ITV reality show Love Island, which has helped it promote the benefits of buying secondhand clothing and attach the eBay name to the circular economy. Vice president and general manager for eBay UK Eve Williams describes pre-loved as the company\u2019s \u201cheartland\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever because it gives consumers access to great products, quality products, at a price they want, in a way that they can trust.\u201d A partnership with pre-loved platform Reskinned, which was launched in September 2022 and sees individual brands launching dedicated secondhand goods pages on eBay to further promote the circular economy, is just one initiative showcasing eBay\u2019s green credentials. But it has ambitious group-wide plans, too. \u201cOur Science Based Targets Initiative is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90% by 2030. 2019 is our baseline year and our goal is 100% renewable energy by 2025, and we\u2019ve already reached about 91% of that,\u201d says Williams. The online marketplace is also helping its sellers act more sustainably by ramping up advice in this area, as well as making sustainability training for staff a priority for 2024. Retail HQs go green Both Osprey London and The Fragrance Shop have prioritised making their headquarters more sustainable for 2024, putting green issues front and centre of their plans. Osprey founder and chief executive Graeme Ellisdon says: \u201cWe\u2019ve just moved into the home for the brand, which is called The Who and is based in the Chiltern Hills, and I think this whole location is going to become a metaphor for the company. \u201cWe\u2019re rewilding a third of the site, putting in a lot of solar panels, we\u2019re bringing a lot of our own water on board. We\u2019re trying to be as independent and sustainable as we possibly can and I think that\u2019s very true to our heart.\u201d The Fragrance Shop, meanwhile, has moved its headquarters to a new state-of-the-art facility in Trafford Park, Manchester. Owner and chief executive Sanjay Vadera says: \u201cAs a business, we have invested heavily into our ESG initiatives. Our new head office contains a large area of solar panels in Trafford Park, a sophisticated rainwater system that stores water for toilet use and a heat recovery system to recycle warm and cold air to reduce energy.\u201d The business has also appointed a board director with responsibility for ESG to acknowledge the important part the company and the wider retail industry play in this area. Carbon neutral and beyond Cycling brand Rapha has a target to become carbon neutral by 2025, which joint managing director Daniel Blumire acknowledges is \u201cambitious\u201d, but this comes after seven or eight years of work to reduce its footprint. Part of that involves using new manufacturing products with \u201cenvironmentally preferred materials\u201d and investing in its materials team. \u201cIt has been a challenge financially. These materials are generally more expensive and it\u2019s definitely hit the margin by a few points,\u201d Blumire admits. \u201cOur assumption is that, as it becomes more the norm, the cost should at least stabilise and not keep going up.\u201d Meanwhile, THG has committed to meeting its targets for net-zero carbon by 2040 through its THG x Planet Earth strategy. It has since set about dealing with sustainability-related costs by acquiring different suppliers in its supply chain. For example, THG has become a big plastics recycler after buying up plastic manufacturing sites. \u201cWe even buy used PPE from hospitals and spoiled notes materials from the Bank of England, and turn them into plastic pellets for reuse in society. \u201cAside from the environmental impacts, this is also becoming an increasing revenue stream for us,\u201d says chief executive Matthew Moulding, explaining that sustainability initiatives can pay for themselves and even be profitable. Further, THG More:Trees, which works with governments internationally to plant more trees, is an initiative that encourages customers of its Ingenuity (third-party ecommerce service) to partake in. THG\u2019s net zero targets have also now been validated by SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative).
