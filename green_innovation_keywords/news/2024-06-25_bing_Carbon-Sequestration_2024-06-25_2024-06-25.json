Apple explained that it was able to reduce emissions from materials and transportation in production by having suppliers switch to renewable energy. The company also announced that it would no longer use leather in its new bands for Apple Watches, or for phone cases due to the high carbon footprint from the cattle industry. Instead, the company is using a material made from almost 70% recycled content that it\u2019s calling FineWoven. Their sustainability message came with a skit in which Apple employees and CEO Tim Cook explained to Octavia Spencer, who plays Mother Nature, that the company is on track for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030. 2030 Status | Mother Nature | Apple But it turns out that having an entirely carbon-neutral product depends on the combination of items purchased. \u201cSelect case and band combinations of Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra\u2122 2, and Apple Watch SE\u00ae are Apple\u2019s first-ever carbon neutral products,\u201d a press release about the products explained. It\u2019s great that a multinational business is working on lowering its emissions, but major corporations need to be held to higher standards that go beyond buying the right combination of things. Apple\u2019s large target is carbon neutrality by 2030\u2014that should be the most important metric that we judge the company by. On one end, Apple is definitely moving in the right direction to reach that goal. According to data from the company\u2019s 2023 sustainability report, Apple produced about 20.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022. Just half a decade earlier in 2018, the company produced 25.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The company has also paired lowering overall emissions with carbon credit programs that remove CO2 from the atmosphere by restoring grassland and wetland environments worldwide. \u201cOnly after Apple steeply cuts product emissions, will the company apply high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects for emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced with existing solutions,\u201d Apple said in a statement. According to the United States Geological Survey, wetlands are actually an amazing tool for carbon sequestration. Restoring and protecting these wetlands from erosion and vegetation loss could boost natural sequestration methods. However, these projects that Apple is investing in need to be permanent in order to claim that the project did remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Apple is also working on developing AI tools that could rival options like OpenAI or ChatGPT, Bloomberg reported in July. If developed and widely used, chatbot tools could increase Apple\u2019s water usage. Recent data found that other major tech companies have used alarming amounts of water to cool data centers. Data from Microsoft\u2019s latest sustainability report outlined that the software giant\u2019s water usage spiked by more than a third between 2021 and 2022 as the company heavily invested in its AI capabilities and planned for new AI-related data centers. It also takes up a lot of energy to train machine-learning models. A report released this April by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence outlined how the energy needed to train models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 is enough to power an average home in the U.S. for hundreds of years. Apple has put a lot of action behind making its products and operations increasingly sustainable. But companies often switch up their tactics or decide to delay sustainability deadlines. Everyone from consumers to watchdogs has to keep an eye out on corporations, well after a company releases a well-worded press release about lowering the emissions created by products.

According to Bayer farmers will benefit from new technologies that will help them produce more while restoring nature through innovations that power regenerative agriculture. Bayer considers regenerative agriculture as an outcome-based production model, with improving soil health as a key component, leading to increased resilience. Other key aspects include increased productivity; adaption and mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; increased carbon sequestration in the soil; maintaining, preserving or restoring on-farm biodiversity; conserving water resources through improved water retention, reduction in water run-off, as well as improved social and economic well-being of farmers and their communities. Regenerative agriculture Bayer\u2019s R&D pipeline is driving the transformation to regenerative agriculture through three pillars. The first is through an annual portfolio refresh of new germplasm and new crop protection formulations that help farmers compete in a changing environment. The second pillar refers to completely new products like seed and trait technologies or novel crop protection solutions with blockbuster potential, fueling stable long-term growth. The third pillar consists of key collaborations on technologies like gene editing and biological solutions with strategic partners that are complementing Bayer\u2019s in-house R&D efforts. Preceon Smart Corn System With the Preceon Smart Corn System farmers will benefit from better protection of their crops, better access during the season and higher yields. Bayer\u2019s 2023 Groundbreaker trials in the U.S., which included 365 growers, resulted in more than 80 percent reporting they would plant Preceon Smart Corn again. The targeted commercial launch of the conventional breeding short-stature corn approach earlier this year is also paralleled with progress on the biotech version which has now advanced to R&D phase 4. Biologicals are complementing synthetic products Bayer has accelerated its Biologicals R&D pipeline substantially. Through multi-year strategic research and development partnerships with Ginkgo Bioworks, Kimitec, MustGrow and others, Bayer is accelerating the delivery of breakthrough biological innovations in the areas of next-generation nitrogen fixation, crop protection and biostimulant products \u2013 all while continuing to deliver innovative new products through leading development platforms.
