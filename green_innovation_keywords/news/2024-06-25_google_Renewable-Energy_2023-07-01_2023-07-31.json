In January, the company commenced production of its n-type i-TOPCon cells at its 8GW factory in Suqian, Jiangsu Province. These cells are used to produce the new generation Vertex N modules, with power output of up to 605W and efficiency reaching 22.4%, catering for commercial and industrial (C&I) and utility-scale projects. Together with the Vertex N 700W for utility scenarios and Vertex S+ 450W for rooftop PV systems, Trina Solar\u2019s n-type module portfolio is based on its 210 product technology platform and i-TOPCon cell technology. N-type cells feature a number of advantages, including high conversion efficiency, high bifaciality and power and a low temperature coefficient. A total of 30GW of capacity will be rolled out to the market by the end of 2023. In addition to the company\u2019s module business, its subsidiary TrinaTracker has also launched its latest Vanguard 2P tracker solution. According to de la Vi\u00f1a, TrinaTracker not only focuses on producing trackers, but also fixed structures: \u201cWe\u2019re selling products in European countries including Germany, France, the UK and Ireland, where a 200MW project has recently been completed.\u201d TrinaTracker exports components from factories in Spain and China and is planning to expand further. According to de la Vi\u00f1a, a Brazil factory is also under construction to offer faster delivery for Latin American clients. \u201cWe set up an R&D and engineering centre in Europe for trackers, together with the China based R&D and engineering centre, in order to better service clients from all around the world,\u201d he continued. Asia is currently the main market for the tracker business, with June seeing the company sign an agreement with Dongfang Electric International Corporation to be the exclusive supplier of 510MW of Vanguard 1P trackers for the Jizzakh and Samarkand power plants in Uzbekistan. TrinaTracker also provided 2,618 sets of trackers for the 100MW Nur Navoi project, Uzbekistan\u2019s first solar power plant, which was inaugurated in August 2021. The company has additionally supplied 875MW of Vanguard 2P trackers to the IC project in Qatar, developed by the state-owned petroleum company QatarEnergy, with EPC responsibility falling under Samsung C&T. Moving on to Trina\u2019s overall strategy in Europe, de la Vi\u00f1a commented: \u201cWe want to be one of the top two players on the module side and a top-three company in the tracker industry \u2013 and, despite being a relative newcomer, we also want to be one of the top five storage companies in Europe.\u201d As of March 2023, Trina Solar had delivered over 140GW of solar modules worldwide and in 2022 invested some RMB4.62 billion (US$639 million) on R&D. Moving forward, de la Vi\u00f1a added that the company will also offer hydrogen solutions and will continue to expand in Europe as he sees great potential there. Plans are also underway to further lower Trina\u2019s environmental impact under its overall ESG strategy, as part of which it aims to achieve 100% renewable energy use in its manufacturing and operations by 2030. A recent highlight underlining the company\u2019s environmental ambitions has been securing Type 1 Zero Carbon Factory certification from the TiGroup for its Yiwu manufacturing facility, the primary location for the production of the Vertex S product line. The factory is the first in the industry to be awarded such status by an independent agency. \u201cThis certification demonstrates Trina Solar\u2019s strong commitment to sustainable development and zero carbon practices across our technology, products and process management,\u201d explained de la Vi\u00f1a. \u201cWe look forward to continuing sustainable manufacturing at our Yiwu site and replicating a similar scheme in our other factories, while discovering new and innovative ways of further enhancing the entire Trina Solar ecosystem to reduce emissions, protect the environment and provide communities across the globe with low-carbon, green technology.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Almost a year later, the IRA is proving more potent than anticipated, pushing clean energy investment beyond initial predictions and making the U.S. the standard-bearer on energy transition policy. But the impact to date is just the beginning. The landmark legislation has the potential to slingshot the economy even further toward net zero by incentivizing investment in clean energy across an enormous range of businesses in a wide swath of industries. To seize the opportunities presented by the IRA, however, companies will need a deep understanding of this complex, nuanced law\u2019s details and mechanisms. Recently, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America (MHI-A) convened a panel of leaders from energy, finance, industry, and academia to discuss the IRA and what it means for their businesses and industries \u2013 offering what they\u2019ve learned so far, where the U.S. and the world need to go next, and what companies need to know to make the most of this era-defining law. \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act has changed the energy transition landscape,\u201d says Takajiro Ishikawa, President and CEO of MHIA. \u201cWorking together and sharing insights across companies and industries will move the needle to create a lower carbon future for society\u201d. Clio Crespy, Senior Managing Director of Guggenheim Securities, agrees with this assessment in her remarks during the panel. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a critical competitive advantage for the companies that are able to effectively navigate the regulations, the framework and the implementation,\u201d she says. Watch: Roundtable discussion on the short- and long-term impacts of the IRA Participants: Takajiro Ishikawa, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America Clio Crespy, Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities Matt Crocker, Senior Vice President, Low Carbon Solutions, ExxonMobil Dr. Ken Medlock, Senior Director of the Center for Energy Studies, Baker Institute at Rice University Anna Wishart, Director of External Affairs, Monolith Materials Industrial policy re-envisioned: What the IRA does The IRA\u2019s core principle is simple: Accelerate the energy transition with incentives rather than penalties. The law directs nearly $400 billion in federal funding to clean energy efforts through a mix of tax incentives, grants, and loan guarantees. Most of the funding takes the form of tax credits designed to spur corporate investment in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing \u2013 generating financing that will enable innovation, help companies scale solutions, and drive down costs across a wide range of decarbonization technologies. \u201cWhat\u2019s brilliant about the IRA is that it's tech-neutral and performance-based,\u201d says Anna Wishart, Director of External Affairs at clean tech startup Monolith Materials. \u201cIt leaves the world open for any type of technology, even those that haven't been invented yet, as long as you can show you can reduce emissions.\u201d The amount of clean energy funding the law provides, while impressive, understates its ultimate impact. Many of the IRA\u2019s mechanisms are designed to leverage vastly more in private investment, including opportunities for public-private partnerships and cooperation among companies \u2013 \u201ccoop-etition,\u201d as noted during the panel. The energy transition can\u2019t be done by just one party. Collaboration and communication between all parties is key. Takajiro Ishikawa, President & CEO, MHI-A The IRA\u2019s tax credits provide visibility into future revenues and allow for securitization that enables further investment. \u201cLine of sight to revenue was a stumbling block for many emerging clean technologies,\u201d says Clio Crespy, Senior Managing Director at Guggenheim Securities. \u201cThe IRA is transformational. I can\u2019t stress enough how important line of sight is in terms of being able to underwrite revenues.\u201d The impact across companies and industries The IRA is already having far-reaching effects, both on the volume of clean energy investment and the span of industries it touches. In fact, the law has driven much greater investment than even optimists projected when it was signed. In the IRA\u2019s first year: The leap in investment affects every company related to the energy transition, from legacy giants to startups. It accelerated ExxonMobil\u2019s development of its Low Carbon Solutions division, which works on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. \u201cIt clearly starts with good, sound, durable policy,\u201d says Matt Crocker, the group\u2019s Senior Vice President. \u201cThat has caused a broad cross-section of the industry to think about emissions reduction and the incentives to get started.\u201d For example, ExxonMobil is among the world\u2019s largest producers of hydrogen. Encouraged by incentives from the IRA, the company is capturing the carbon from hydrogen production, then using the resulting clean hydrogen to reduce its own emissions and to help customers reduce theirs. At the other end of the size spectrum is Lincoln, Nebraska-based Monolith Materials. The startup has a proprietary process for using renewable energy to power methane pyrolysis, which breaks captured methane into carbon and hydrogen. Monolith uses the carbon to create carbon black, a key ingredient in tires and a myriad of other products, and uses the hydrogen to create anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer. Monolith exemplifies the benefits of revenue visibility provided by the IRA\u2019s tax credits. \u201cClean energy is very hard to get built as a small company,\u201d says Monolith\u2019s Wishart. \u201cA utility might look at us and say \u2018You\u2019re too new. We\u2019re going to make you put down a significant amount of money upfront to securitize this wind or solar development.\u2019\u201d With the IRA, the startup is able to achieve the top-tier tax credit and it\u2019s working on a billion-dollar expansion that\u2019s expected to create new jobs along with new products. \u201cThe IRA makes us able to get that done that much faster,\u201d she says. A new era of collaboration Collaboration \u2013 within and across industries and sectors, between corporations, governments, nonprofits and academia, and around the world \u2013 can help all parties realize the IRA\u2019s promise and drive the economy toward net zero. Larger businesses, says MHI-A\u2019s Ishikawa, can and should help clear paths for companies like Monolith. \u201cCompanies like ours that have big balance sheets can finance our own projects to show the world that this technology is workable and safe and can help decarbonize,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a role we need to play.\u201d Such collaborations are taking many forms to accelerate the energy transition. For example, MHI is making direct investments in a range of startups, including Monolith, bringing expertise, resources, connections, and financial clout that can help them navigate the new law\u2019s intricacies and build economies of scale. MHI is also working with ExxonMobil on carbon capture. Mitsubishi Power, a power solutions brand of MHI, is in a joint venture with Magnum Development to build the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hydrogen hub in Utah. The facility, currently under construction, is expected to nearly double worldwide clean hydrogen capacity and is financed in part by a $500 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. And these new collaborations aren\u2019t limited to the United States. \u201cThe IRA has forced other countries to re-envision how they\u2019re going to approach industrial policy,\u201d says Dr. Ken Medlock, Senior Director of the Center for Energy Studies, Baker Institute at Rice University. \u201cJoint Ventures are critical. A lot of international players are looking at how they can add value in the U.S. and partnering with U.S. entities as well.\u201d In the U.S. and elsewhere, stakeholders are coming to the same realization about the scope, complexity and urgency of net zero. \u201cThe energy transition can\u2019t be done by just one party,\u201d says Ishikawa. \u201cCollaboration and communication between all parties is key.\u201d What\u2019s next for the IRA and clean energy Will a change in political winds derail the IRA? Medlock is doubtful. \u201cThere will be noise, but it\u2019s highly unlikely it will be undone,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, I think there\u2019s a lot of interest on both sides of the aisle to assist the impact of the legislation rather than denigrate it.\u201d The next big front is permitting reform. \u201cPermitting is the big unknown with regard to how successful the law will be,\u201d Medlock says. \u201cIf you\u2019re subsidizing projects but can\u2019t permit infrastructure, it won\u2019t matter. That\u2019s on the table, and I see a very high likelihood of something being passed, which will only help to accelerate the impact of the IRA.\u201d As companies look to reap the IRA\u2019s benefits, collaboration may be the most powerful means to navigate its complexities and make the most of short and long-term opportunities. \u201cThe energy transition is going to take contributions from everyone throughout the public and private sectors,\u201d says Ishikawa. \u201cIt takes a big, complicated policy framework to govern all those efforts. Working together will help all of us make the most of it, benefiting our businesses and creating a lower-carbon future for society.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Subscribe to Solar Builder magazine for free (print or digital) right here. Lowering costs, improving performance, and increasing the speed of deployment are essential to the solar industry\u2019s ability to compete with fossil fuel power sources. Our collective ability to drive costs out of the project value chain is one of the primary reasons solar accounted for 50% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the U.S. last year. Today, one of the most promising opportunities for continued cost reductions, both at the module and system level, relates to developing and deploying large-format PV modules. The value proposition is so compelling that some industry analysts expect large-format modules to account for 90% of the utility market by 2025. Recently, large-format product adoption has started expanding beyond the utility sector into distributed generation (DG) markets. In this article, I explore what is driving the industry-wide pivot to large-format PV modules. I also consider unique technical risks of these new products and recommend strategic risk mitigation approaches. In sharing these insights, my goal is not to recommend or vilify a specific product, technology, or manufacturer \u2014 rather, it is to empower you to identify and specify the best products and system designs for your unique applications. Large-format benefits The high-level benefits of large-format PV modules are easy to see. Larger wafers and cells \u2014 typically 182 mm (M10) or 210 mm (M12) square \u2014 facilitate larger form factor modules. These new modules are generally more than 2 m long and have capacity ratings ranging from 500 W to more than 800 W. For an industry long accustomed to incremental module capacity improvements, super-sized PV modules represent a massive jump in module-level output power ratings. Year-over-year cell-efficiency increases typically result in output power gains of 10 W to 15 W annually. By comparison, the switch from a traditional M6 (166 mm square) wafer format to M10 or M12 wafers might increase the module-level output power by 100 W to 150 W. The value proposition for large-format PV modules is multilayered. At the manufacturing level, large-format modules facilitate efficiencies of scale to drive down production costs. Further downstream, large-format modules promise additional cost-per-Watt savings, as handling fewer higher-capacity modules for the same plant capacity provides logistical efficiencies and drives down in-field labor costs. At the system level, large-format modules increase source-circuit power levels, enhance plant-level energy density and facilitate balance of system (BOS) savings. Hongbin Fang, LONGi Solar\u2019s director of product marketing, notes, \u201cIn the last couple of years, large-format modules have been an effective way to improve module power, achieve lower manufacturing cost, and help customers to reduce BOS cost. As a result, large-format modules have helped the industry accelerate the process of achieving a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE).\u201d Large-format tradeoffs When evaluating large-format modules for specific projects and applications, bear in mind that upfront savings may come at a cost. Some risk and uncertainty are inherent to any new product or technology with limited field exposure. However, large-format modules also present some unique challenges. From a structural point of view, large-format PV modules expose a larger module surface area to the same environmental stresses for a given location. All else being equal, larger modules are inherently subject to an increase in body deflection and torsion compared to smaller modules. As a result, the silicon cells in these modules are subject to increased mechanical stress and pressure. In practice, however, all else is not held equal as module surface area increases. To counteract the 20% to 30% increase in module surface area, it is not uncommon for manufacturers to reduce glass and module frame thickness in an effort to control weight. This convergence of variables \u2014 characterized by heavier but thinner module glass, longer but lower-profile aluminum perimeter frames, and a larger surface area \u2014 invariably results in a weaker module. RETC\u2019s hail durability test data indicates that large modules with thinner front glass are less resilient to severe diameter hail than previous module designs. This vulnerability is partly a function of the fact that thinner glass has less cross-sectional area to absorb a shock without shattering. More critically, heat tempering requires a minimum glass thickness (\u22653.2 mm). Many large-format bifacial modules have a 2.0 mm glass-on-2.0 mm glass package. This \u201cheat-strengthened\u201d glass is not as strong as tempered glass. Large-format modules may also increase risks associated with accelerated performance degradation or long-term operating costs in high-wind areas or high-elevation locations with extreme snow loads. Elevated environmental stresses will tend to exacerbate deflection and torsion in large-format PV modules, increasing the potential for cell cracking. As cell cracks increase in severity, so does the risk of performance degradation, service life reduction and hotspots. Meeting the challenge Until large-format modules are a proven commodity in diverse environments and market sectors, project stakeholders must carefully assess these products based on the specific installation environment and highly accelerated life testing data. Moreover, the industry needs to ensure its testing protocols and sequences are adequate to capture potential failure modes and wearout mechanisms in modules subject to higher mechanical stresses, including heavy snow loads and dynamic wind effects. \u201cHigher power class modules are here to stay,\u201d says Daniel Chang, senior director of solar product management at Qcells North America. \u201cBut these product innovations still need to withstand a 25- or 30-year project life in extreme environments. This is why beyond-certification testing in the laboratory is so important. By validating product designs via highly accelerated third-party testing, the industry is able to bring innovative products to market while ensuring long-term durability and performance.\u201d At the end of the day, the risks and rewards associated with large-format modules are not equitably distributed. For module manufacturers, the trend toward large-format modules is an opportunity to increase profit margins and differentiate themselves in the market. For developers and EPCs, this cost-saving opportunity may increase close rates and market share. In the event that in-field reliability and performance suffer, host customers, insurance companies and financiers are likely the ones footing the bill. Therefore, these project stakeholders and their technical advisors must ask the right questions and review relevant testing data when qualifying large-format modules, especially for locations subject to extreme weather. Super-sized in resi, C&I The utility project sector is ideally suited for leveraging economies of scale. As such, module companies developed the first PV modules to integrate M10 and M12 cells with 1,500-volt ground-mounted applications in mind. Today, more and more manufacturers offer super-sized PV modules for distributed generation (DG) applications. Especially in behind-the-meter rooftop applications, it is important to holistically evaluate the pros and cons of large-format products. Product storage: For some manufacturers, the pivot to large-format module designs coincides with innovative packing configurations that optimize container utilization. In some cases, manufacturers palletize modules in a vertical format, which may necessitate warehouse compatibility upgrades. On the jobsite, pallets with a smaller base area and taller center of gravity may require special attention to prevent tipping. Pay attention to point load limits when staging low-slope rooftops. Material handling: Large-format modules are incompatible with single-person handling, which may impact optimal crew size, workflow and jobsite safety. Bigger and heavier modules will increase crew member fatigue, potentially requiring additional rest and hydration breaks. In some cases, existing rooftop transportation practices will be incompatible with larger-format products. If so, consider investing in rooftop transport equipment that improves jobsite safety and project throughput. Pay attention to vehicle or trailer load limits during transportation. Design flexibility: Bigger is not always better in space-constrained applications. On the one hand, high-power product designs reduce the module count for a given project capacity. On the other hand, large-area modules may limit array layout options. This challenge is especially true for rooftop projects with many obstructions. BOS compatibility: Integrating large-format PV modules into DG applications may require different power electronics and racking components as compared to business-as-usual systems. Designers may not experience BOS compatibility problems with systems designed from scratch with high-power modules in mind. However, substituting large-format modules for conventional products may require re-engineering and procuring alternative products.

Those biorenewable plastics are called PDKs, a new type of plastic that can be efficiently recycled over and over again. Replacing petrochemicals with the bio alternative expanded the PDK\u2019s working temperature, opening applications in the auto industry and beyond With even modest improvements, using bio alternatives could be both greener and cheaper than petrochemicals in the near-term. Plastic waste is a problem. Most plastics can\u2019t be recycled, and many use finite, polluting petrochemicals as the basic ingredients. But that\u2019s changing. In a study published today in Nature Sustainability, researchers successfully engineered microbes to make biological alternatives for the starting ingredients in an infinitely recyclable plastic known as poly(diketoenamine), or PDK. The finding comes from collaboration among experts at three facilities at the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab): the Molecular Foundry, the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), and the Advanced Light Source. \u201cThis is the first time that bioproducts have been integrated to make a PDK that is predominantly bio-based,\u201d said Brett Helms, staff scientist at the Molecular Foundry who led the project. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the first time that you see a bio-advantage over using petrochemicals, both with respect to the material\u2019s properties and the cost of producing it at scale.\u201d Unlike traditional plastics, PDK can be repeatedly deconstructed into pristine building blocks and formed into new products with no loss in quality. PDKs initially used building blocks derived from petrochemicals, but those ingredients can be redesigned and produced with microbes instead. Now, after four years of effort, collaborators have manipulated E. coli to turn sugars from plants into some of the starting materials \u2013 a molecule known as triacetic acid lactone, or bioTAL \u2013 and produced a PDK with roughly 80% bio-content. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that the pathway to 100% bio-content in recyclable plastics is feasible,\u201d said Jeremy Demarteau, a project scientist on the team contributing to biopolymer development. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that from us in the future.\u201d PDKs can be used for a variety of products, including adhesives, flexible items like computer cables or watch bands, building materials, and \u201ctough thermosets,\u201d rigid plastics made through a curing process. Researchers were surprised to find that incorporating the bioTAL into the material expanded its working temperature range by up to 60 degrees Celsius compared to the petrochemical version. This opens the door to using PDKs in items that need specific working temperatures, including sports gear and automotive parts such as bumpers or dashboards. Solving the plastic waste problem The United Nations Environment Program estimates that we globally produce about 400 million tons of plastic waste every year, and that number is predicted to climb to more than 1 billion tons by 2050. Of the 7 billion tons of plastic waste already created, only about 10 percent has been recycled, while most is discarded into landfills or burned. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep using our dwindling supply of fossil fuels to feed this insatiable desire for plastics,\u201d said Jay Keasling, a professor at UC Berkeley, senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Biosciences Area, and the CEO of JBEI. \u201cWe want to help solve the plastic waste problem by creating materials that are both biorenewable and circular \u2013 and providing an incentive for companies to use them. Then people could have the products they need for the time they need them, before those items are transformed into something new.\u201d The study released today also builds on a 2021 environmental and technological analysis, which showed that PDK plastic could be commercially competitive with conventional plastics if produced at a large scale. \u201cOur new results are extremely encouraging,\u201d said Corinne Scown, a staff scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Energy Technologies Area and a vice president at JBEI. \u201cWe found that with even modest improvements to the production process, we could soon be making bio-based PDK plastics that are both cheaper and emit less CO2 than those made with fossil fuels.\u201d Those improvements would include speeding up the rate at which microbes convert sugars to bioTAL, using bacteria that can transform a wider variety of plant-derived sugars and other compounds, and powering the facility with renewable energy.

The Gear Noise Finder The metrology on the H\u00f6fler Cylindrical Gear Roll Testing Machine R 300 provides a reliable way to determine the root causes of gearbox noise. Due to the short measuring time, it can be easily integrated into any manufacturing process and enables 100% quality control of the gears produced. The R 300 is designed for all roll testing processes that are relevant for evaluating the running behavior and noise behavior of gears. These include the single-flank test, the structure-borne noise test and torsional acceleration test, and the double flank test. Depending on its equipment, the R 300 enables testing of gears and shafts, a particularly important factor for components from an electric vehicle drivetrain system (eDrive). For testing the eDrive intermediate shaft, Klingelnberg will demonstrate a process for roll testing both gears on the shaft in one test cycle. This saves time for a second loading and unloading and for re-tooling the machine, and reduces test costs. Combined Production Cell A 100% quality control of the gears can be carried out either as an incoming inspection for assembly or immediately after hard finishing of the gear in production. The advantage of the latter option is that only OK parts are passed on to the next process step, thus preventing any rejects from undergoing the finishing process. The Klingelnberg production cell \u2013 consisting of the H\u00f6fler Cylindrical Gear Grinding Machine Speed Viper, the CompactLoader and the integrated H\u00f6fler Cylindrical Gear Roll Testing Machine R 300 \u2013 is ideally suited for this purpose. The production cell can be equipped with all machine models in the Speed Viper series \u2013 from the Speed Viper 80\u00b2 (dual spindle) to the Speed Viper 300. The Klingelnberg production cell is the solution for the manufacture and 100% quality testing of high-precision gears for the electric drive train. What\u2019s more, the R 300 is networked with Klingelnberg\u2019s GearEngine, making it possible to use roll testing data for production evaluation and tolerance management. With the optionally available R 300 production monitor, users always have a documented overview of the current key quality indicators in their production. Reducing Measurement Times in Series Measurement using a Hybrid Solution The introduction of hybrid metrology with optical pitch measurement has significantly reduced measurement times. It is now possible to perform optical pitch measurement on almost all surfaces using the white light sensor technology (HISPEED OPTOSCAN) developed by Klingelnberg and partners, along with other innovative measuring strategies. Two other processes for reliably measuring single pitch deviations are also available. All Klingelnberg Precision Measuring Centers in the P 26 to P 65 series can be optionally retrofitted with the optical sensor (HISPEED OPTOSCAN). For new machines, the \u2018Ready for Optic\u2019 option is also available, providing a factory-installed setup for subsequent retrofitting. Through the systematic use of the standardized Gear Data Exchange (GDE) interface when importing and exporting data and measurement results, Klingelnberg has set a higher standard in Metrology 4.0 in the area of measurement results diagnostics and networking of production machines and metrology \u2013 a system it calls the Closed Loop.

But organizations need to go further and reset their procurement strategies, move from a transactional to a system-based approach, and help create a sustainable power ecosystem in line with worldwide climate ambitions, according to a new report from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and BCG. Savvy players are already doing this. In What\u2019s Next for Companies Procuring Renewable Power?, we set out six ways in which forward-looking companies have changed the way they purchase renewable power to focus on ambitious sustainability-led procurement actions. By learning from these approaches, business leaders can future-proof their power procurement strategies and meet rising expectations from stakeholders and regulators. Exponential Growth in Corporate Demand for Renewable Power As key purchasers of clean power, companies are playing an increasingly important role in supporting the development of additional renewable generating capacity\u2014which is essential for the energy transition and attainment of global climate goals. Since 2008, businesses have signed long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 148 gigawatts of clean power for their operations\u2014more than the total power-generating capacity of France. And in 2022, companies committed to buy a record 36.7 gigawatts of clean power through PPAs, 18% more than the previous year. Corporate purchasers have become more ambitious about how they procure renewable power and meet green-energy commitments. Corporate purchasers have become more ambitious about how they procure renewable power and meet green-energy commitments. While the use of PPAs has become far more widespread, both geographically and by industry, companies are also diversifying their procurement strategies by investing directly in their own renewable power plants, buying clean electricity from utility companies, or purchasing certificates. Drivers of High-Impact Procurement While far more companies are selecting renewable power, business leaders seeking to enhance the impact of their power procurement strategies face challenges and pressures from multiple directions. They must navigate an evolving landscape of sustainability goals while addressing the potential risk of being perceived as greenwashing and must account for new developments in power markets resulting from factors such as increased renewable capacity and regulatory changes. Evolving Sustainability Aspirations Several sustainability-based dynamics are creating tailwinds for companies to procure carbon-free power. Here are the main ones. Increasing Stakeholder Expectations. Companies are confronting growing demands from stakeholders to take a broad set of sustainability considerations, including environmental and social impacts, into account when making key decisions for their businesses. Building these factors into their power procurement strategies can help organizations respond to stakeholder expectations. Worldwide sustainability rules are set to become both more standardized and more demanding. More Stringent Sustainability Regulations. Worldwide sustainability rules are set to become both more standardized and more demanding. By taking action now and getting ahead of these emerging requirements, companies can reduce the risk of noncompliance. This is particularly important in power procurement, where players are making decisions that will last for many years. Rising Ambitions for Voluntary Commitments. Rather than simply reducing emissions from their own business operations (scope 1 emissions), forward-thinking players\u2014helped by new methodologies and metrics\u2014are reshaping the way they procure power so that they have a positive impact on supply chain emissions (scope 2) and emissions arising from the use of their products (scope 3). Business customers and consumers are increasingly demanding such an approach. Power Market Developments Greater renewable generation is changing the dynamics of the global power system\u2014and how companies procure power. Addressing Increased Electric Price Volatility. A high penetration of variable renewable energy generation, continuing geopolitical tensions, and delays in the expansion of electricity grids are set to increase price volatility even as power becomes cleaner. By building more flexibility into their power demand profile, companies can manage the risk of volatility, support the transition away from fossil fuels, and reduce costs. Furthermore, by innovating their business models, they can potentially generate additional revenues. Capitalizing on Prosumer Models. In today\u2019s markets, companies are becoming prosumers. They are investing in their own distributed generating sources (such as solar panels and wind turbines) to meet their localized power needs and selling surplus electricity back to the grid. This trend\u2014which creates revenues for companies and expands renewable capacity\u2014is set to continue. Aligning with Evolving Power Sector Regulations. Power market regulations will evolve to accommodate renewable generation, bringing greater standardization, increased interoperability between networks, and higher technical standards. Savvy companies will collaborate early with policymakers and regulators to support the development of these rules. Six Ways to Support a Sustainable Power System In response to these developments, companies should continue to prioritize using more clean energy for their power requirements\u2014but they also need to rethink their renewable power procurement strategies so that they contribute to a more sustainable global power system and create resilience in the face of changing markets. Here are six leading power procurement approaches that players can learn from: Procure renewable power when it is generated. Companies can use data-driven technologies to ensure that they procure\u2014and consume\u2014renewable power at the same time that it is generated. In this way, they can better match their hour-to-hour consumption to when the sun shines (solar power) or the wind blows (wind power), enabling greater renewable capacity to be integrated into the grid.

In this way, they can better match their hour-to-hour consumption to when the sun shines (solar power) or the wind blows (wind power), enabling greater renewable capacity to be integrated into the grid. Support grid flexibility. Companies can reduce costs by using stored energy for their needs or by changing their operations so that they purchase renewable power from the grid when it is abundant and prices are cheap. These actions also contribute to the flexibility and stability of grids that have a lot of variable renewable capacity.

These actions also contribute to the flexibility and stability of grids that have a lot of variable renewable capacity. Maximize emissions abatement. Forward-thinking organizations are factoring avoided emissions into their strategies and procuring renewable power from projects that yield the largest greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Altering the location of projects and changing the time of day or year when companies procure power are two strategies that can improve emissions abatement.

The manufacture and disposal of renewable plants, and the technologies they contain, have significant environmental and social impacts unless managed properly. Proactive corporate buyers are working with developers and their suppliers to curb emissions throughout the life of the project, ensure that materials are sourced sustainably and ethically, and improve recycling.

Proactive corporate buyers are working with developers and their suppliers to curb emissions throughout the life of the project, ensure that materials are sourced sustainably and ethically, and improve recycling. Avoid damaging nature. By including land use considerations in their decision making, corporate buyers can take steps that prevent renewable power projects from harming nature. For example, they can make sure that projects are located on a brownfield site where possible, that they are not sited in areas that are vital for farming, and that they do not endanger local wildlife.

For example, they can make sure that projects are located on a brownfield site where possible, that they are not sited in areas that are vital for farming, and that they do not endanger local wildlife. Support a just energy transition. Companies can help ensure that projects support a just energy transition by working in tandem with developers to place people and communities at the center of key project decisions. For instance, corporate buyers can push for greater community engagement, identify ways that projects can share benefits with local populations, and help make sure that projects are located to maximize economic opportunities for marginalized communities. By adopting the approaches outlined in this report, companies can help make the global power system more equitable, ensure that it is more positive for nature, and support worldwide climate goals. But businesses should also consider actions that go beyond power procurement. For example, they can use their influence with suppliers and customers to persuade them to decarbonize (and thus tackle their own scope 3 emissions), collaborate with a variety of stakeholders to help scale up new technologies, and use a more holistic approach to meeting all their energy needs, not just for power. In this way, they can have an even greater impact on the transition to a sustainable power system.

Something that captures the interest of many, but comprehending all its aspects and implications requires a significant investment of time and effort. SF 6 is a manufactured greenhouse gas with an extremely high global warming potential (GWP). A metric ton of SF 6 in the atmosphere is equivalent to the same GWP as 23,500 metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere over 100 years. This is equivalent to approximately 125 passenger cars on the road for a year. If accidentally released into the atmosphere, SF 6 remains there for around 3200 years. Rising environmental impact The Earth\u2019s temperatures have been increasing since 1950. Over the last 40 years, each decade has been warmer than the last, with the last 10 years being the hottest on record. SF 6 must be handled with care as it can absorb and emit infrared radiation and prevent it from escaping into space. This trapped heat increases the Earth's surface and atmospheric temperature (the greenhouse effect). The energy sector is among the highest users of SF 6 , accounting for 80 percent of global SF 6 emissions in 2019, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Due to its insulation and current interruption properties, SF 6 has been used for circuit breakers and gas-insulated switchgear in high-voltage substations for decades.

The first aspect of our strategy aims to bring our advanced solutions and technology to more places in the solar market. We want to create more value for our customers by integrating our 4T (Watt\/Bit\/Heat\/Battery) technologies into various applications. The second strategic announcement acknowledges the rapid growth of PV across utility, commercial, and residential sectors, accompanied by the adoption of batteries. We strongly believe that the future grid will be powered by renewable energy and supported by power electronics, from generation to distribution and consumption. To promote development and ensure high-quality standards, we recognize the need to collaborate with our industrial partners. Lastly, we view PV as a business based on an ecosystem. Our booth at the event showcases how our partners have become significant players. We have established partner schematics encompassing industry partners, financial partners, service partners, solution partners, and more. Working together, we aim to further build and expand our ecosystem, fostering collective growth. Can you provide more details about the new products launched for all scenarios? Guoguang Chen: We have aligned our product offerings with the three defined scenarios. For utility applications, our most important solution is the Smart PV & ESS Generator. In countries with high renewable penetration like those utilizing PV and wind, grid instability becomes a concern. This solution addresses voltage, frequency, and power angle challenges, enhancing the future grid as conventional grid generation phases out. It\u2019s the transition from grid-following, grid-supporting to grid-forming technology, enabling support and reinforcement of the grid with high proportion of renewable energy. By integrating the Smart PV Inverters, Smart String ESS, Smart PCS with algorithm, the solution can accelerate PV to be the primary energy source as its wide application in future. With grid-forming technology, it is designed to support future up to 100% renewable energy penetration. This innovation is our most significant contribution to the utility sector.

This comprehensive solution is tailored to suit the diverse requirements of C&I applications. In residential scenario, Huawei aims to lead the future by advancing the evolution of household energy through component innovation and technological upgrades. Through off-grid power backup, intelligent home energy scheduling by AI Energy Management Assistant (EMMA) and the future virtual power plant (VPP) interconnection will enable power independence and self-sufficiency for homes. And just on optimizers, how are these being used? Guoguang Chen: The use of optimizers is crucial in our approach. Rooftops vary in shape, angles, and shading. Our optimizers, equipped with the latest power electronics functionalities, enable full utilization of rooftops and ensure high yield for C&I applications. Safety features like rapid shutdown are integrated into our optimizers, making them a standard part of our solution. Furthermore, our inverters offer arc protection, allowing for higher voltage and current handling. In ESS, our goal is to help individuals balance generation and consumption, particularly in regions where extended power outages are common. Smart PV+ESS solutions replace diesel generation in such areas. Additionally, EV chargers play a crucial role by offering complementary loads for C&I applications. The synergy between diversified generation and load necessitates intelligent load management systems. For high consumption industries, deploying PV on rooftops alone might not suffice. To achieve 100% green power and safe consumption, it becomes necessary to tap into virtual power plants. Therefore, we provide a one-stop solution that includes BIPV (building-integrated PV) to utilize every possible surface for generation. Moreover, we have upgraded our 1+4+X solution for homeowners, increasing the green power consumption rate to 100% even during power outages or when the grid is unavailable. We expand beyond rooftop applications to wall installations and gardens, utilizing any sunlit space as a resource. Different PV technologies can be applied to generate more power, while home energy management systems control generation and consumption. Battery technology advancements, such as our new 7kWh battery pack, offer flexibility in charging, discharging, and power conversion systems (PCS). This ensures varying backup time spans, even in extreme cases like the 10-hour outages in South Africa. With technological advancements and increased battery capacity, homeowners can achieve 100% green power consumption. Furthermore, this fundamental technology is applicable to both on-grid and off-grid scenarios. We observe PV's significant impact on expanding off-grid applications. The largest microgrid project we are currently involved in is in Saudi Arabia, featuring a 400 MW PV system coupled with a 1.3 GWh battery energy storage system. This project, incorporating grid-forming technology, will provide power to one million homes and become the world's largest microgrid. We consider this technology as fundamental in bringing PV to any location, regardless of grid connectivity. You took responsibility for the European FusionSolar business early on, and subsequently, Huawei has made many breakthroughs in Europe. Could you share some stories from your time in Europe in those early days? Guoguang Chen: I arrived in Europe in 2010 when Huawei had just initiated its PV endeavors. Our goal was to establish an R&D center in Europe, considering that Europe was at the forefront in terms of product development and technological advancements. We aimed to bring new and improved products to the PV industry and recognized the global opportunities it presented. I personally traveled to various countries in Europe to determine the ideal location for our R&D center.

We recently published a White Paper in collaboration with TUV to enhance product safety and reliability. With the increase in PV module power, larger inverter power sizes, and doubled current, ensuring physical safety has become even more important. In the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector, where PV is installed on rooftops, higher voltages increase the risk for people, and the potential for short-circuits can lead to fires and disasters. Therefore, continuous improvement in safety measures is essential. High-level arc detection and DC rapid shutdown should be defined within standards, made mandatory, and applied in all countries to ensure the safety of PV installations. Only when we can guarantee safety can the PV industry grow without limitations. PV technology is evolving rapidly, with significant increases in module power and the emergence of decentralized PV within a short span of time. It is crucial to upgrade safety measures and address the challenges that arise while promoting health and quality development in the industry. What is your perspective on the outlook for this year\u2019s PV and storage market? How do you see global installation expectations and the future of combined solar-storage solutions? Guoguang Chen: We anticipate significant growth in the PV and storage market this year. Last year, solar installations reached around 280-300 GW globally, and storage installations reached approximately 40 GWh. This year, we expect solar installations to increase by another 100 GW, reaching around 450 GW. We also anticipate storage installations to grow to about 60 GWh, a 50% increase from the previous year. As more renewable energy sources are integrated into the grid, batteries are being deployed to provide grid support and stability. We have already seen successful deployments of storage systems alongside wind farms in the Netherlands, and we expect this trend to continue in more locations. There is also potential for retrofitting older plants with storage, both large and small, to enhance grid stability and support. However, to achieve this, grid-forming technology is crucial. While we don't see it becoming mandatory, we believe it is essential to work with distribution system operators (DSOs) to develop policies that support the deployment of grid-forming technology. This will enable the storage of more renewables and support countries achieve their carbon targets without the need for extensive grid reconstruction. Is grid-forming technology sufficient to reach 100% renewables? Guoguang Chen: Grid-forming technology is still evolving and will take time to reach maturity. We currently see its application in off-grid scenarios and major projects like the Red Sea project in Saudi Arabia. We expect to see its adoption in residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) sectors as well. However, utility-scale projects may face more challenges due to their scale and complex technological requirements. To achieve innovation and advancements in this area, we need to see large-scale projects taking more risks and being brave in implementing new technologies.

The U.S. Federal government provides funding to advance innovations through thousands of grants, loans, loan guarantees, and cooperative agreements. There currently is more than $350bn in funding through grants and another $400bn in loan authority, which is available for virtually every Technology Readiness Level (TRL). This article lists each of the agencies and their offices, divisions, and departments that provide funding for each of the nine TRLs. Hyperlinks are provided so you can visit the agency websites that list their funding opportunities. A list of current and upcoming grant opportunities, as well as the standing grant and loan guarantee programs for eight federal agencies, which is updated periodically as new grant opportunities become available, can be found on American Diversified Energy\u2019s website under its Find Funding tab. Federal funding opportunities for each TRL Preparation of application for TRL-1 funding: Describe the idea, concept, approach Explain the significance of your idea, concept, approach Identify societal, environmental, or economic needs that will be addressed Lay out the proposed research plan, objectives, methods, tasks, controls, and feasibility, risk, and solution measures Assemble research team Identify milestones and go\/no-go criteria Describe alternatives if the primary approach does not work out This will be your core proposal, which should be adjusted, amplified, and updated at the conclusion of each TRL. The first step: Basic Research Federal funding opportunities: National Science Foundation (NSF) The NSF provides financial support in a wide range of scientific areas, from astronomy to zoology. In addition to funding research in the traditional academic areas, the agency also supports \u201chigh risk, high pay off\u201d ideas, novel collaborations, and projects that may seem like science fiction today but may be commonplace tomorrow. With an annual budget of $11.5bn, NSF makes about 12,000 new grant awards each year, supporting all fields of fundamental science and engineering, including energy innovation and energy efficiency. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) NIFA supports research, educational, and extension efforts in a wide range of scientific fields related to agricultural and behavioural sciences. This includes: Advanced Technologies : bioenergy, biotechnology, nanotechnology : bioenergy, biotechnology, nanotechnology Animals : animal breeding, animal health, animal production, aquaculture : animal breeding, animal health, animal production, aquaculture Business and Economics: markets and trade, natural resource economics, small business, StrikeForce markets and trade, natural resource economics, small business, StrikeForce Education: learning and engagement, minority-serving institutions, workforce development Environment: climate change, ecosystems, invasive pests and diseases Farming and Ranching: agricultural safety, agricultural technology, farmer education, organic agriculture, small and family farms, sustainable agriculture agricultural safety, agricultural technology, farmer education, organic agriculture, small and family farms, sustainable agriculture Food Science: food quality, food safety food quality, food safety International : global food security : global food security Natural Resources: air, forests, grasslands and rangelands, soil, water air, forests, grasslands and rangelands, soil, water Plants: crop production, pest management, plant breeding, plant health crop production, pest management, plant breeding, plant health U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) More than 1,000 grant opportunities are offered each year by the DOD through its various branches of service, medical units, laboratories, research projects, engineering divisions, environmental cleanup and restoration programs, business and inventory management divisions, and energy security initiatives. These include: Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) DARPA\u2019s mission is \u201cto make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies and capabilities for national security.\u201d DARPA has repeatedly delivered on that mission, transforming revolutionary concepts and even seeming impossibilities into practical capabilities. The results have included not only game-changing military capabilities such as precision weapons and stealth technology, but also such icons of modern civilian society such as the Internet, automated voice recognition and language translation, and Global Positioning System receivers small enough to embed in myriad consumer devices. DARPA explicitly reaches for transformational change instead of incremental advances. It is looking for promising technologies within science and engineering research communities. These new designs and technologies have to radically improve military capabilities, offering \u201cstrategies to surprise our adversaries,\u201d with payoffs for non-military uses afterwards (such as the computer, ceramic bearings, and insulators). The DARPA investment has to fundamentally reshape existing fields or create entirely new disciplines and transform these initiatives into profoundly new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security and the commercial and private sectors. Other DOD grant opportunities While DARPA focuses exclusively on transformational and disruptive innovations, there are many other opportunities to propose new ideas, concepts, and approaches to the DOD. The primary criterion the DOD uses in assessing a proposal is: will its development result in a procurement contract from DOD? In other words, once it reaches TRL-9 and is ready for commercialization, will it improve the DOD\u2019s ability to carry out is mission through better technologies, systems, or operational readiness? If so, will DOD buy it? If not, you need to look elsewhere for grants. DOD has set a goal to reduce petroleum use throughout all branches of the military and increase its use of alternative energy sources for all power and fuel consumed by 50 percent within the next five years. Any innovation \u2013 at any TRL \u2013 that will help DOD meet this goal will be of interest to DOD. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Research Program Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided approximately $1.8 billion in R&D funding for more than 660 potentially transformational energy technology projects. ARPA-E funds technology-focused, applied research and development aimed at creating real-world solutions to important problems in energy creation, distribution, and use. ARPA-E issues periodic Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs), which are focused on overcoming specific technical barriers around a specific energy area. ARPA-E also issues periodic OPEN FOAs to identify high-potential projects that address the full range of energy-related technologies, as well as funding solicitations aimed at supporting America\u2019s small business innovators. Office of Science (OS) The Office of Science is the basic scientific research arm of the Department of Energy. It issues a cross-cutting, open solicitation annually that is open year-round. It also issues several FOAs each year focusing on specific research needs that are open to one or more institutions, as well as DOE National Laboratory Announcements that are open only to DOE laboratories.

It can move from initial presentation to approval of a funding award in as little as 90 days. It seeks to contract with companies offering disruptive, game-changing solutions in a range of areas \u2013 from autonomy and artificial intelligence to human systems, information technology, and space \u2013 to solve a host of defence problems. View the PBS NewsHour special on DIUx that aired on August 15, 2018, at: https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/how-the-pentagon-joins-forces-with-silicon-valley-startups. Other DOD grant opportunities See description of financial support under TRL-1 above U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) DOE funding for ideas, concepts, and approaches in the TRL-2, -3, and -4 stages of development typically come through the DOE\u2019s SBIR\/STTR program, which issue SBIR\/STTR funding solicitations twice per year tied to specific areas of focus from its various offices, except for ARPA-E. (See the Phase I SBIR\/STTR description below.) Each DOE office also issue periodic Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) targeted to a wide range of TRLs for research, development, and demonstration in the fields of interest related to their missions. These include: Advanced Research Program Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above Office of Science (OS) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above Office of Fossil Energy (FE) The Office of Fossil Energy is responsible for federal research, development, and demonstration efforts for advanced power generation, power plant efficiency, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. Its interests include transformational approaches, preliminary design and techno-economic analyses, and new methods for making products from fossil fuel byproducts, wastes, and emissions; reducing the environmental impacts of fossil fuel use; and improving the efficiency, reliability, and flexibility of existing fossil fuel systems and operations. Office of Energy Delivery and Reliability (OE) and Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) The Office of Electricity (OE) leads the Department of Energy\u2019s efforts to ensure a resilient, reliable, and flexible electricity system. OE works to develop new technologies to improve the infrastructure that brings electricity into the nation\u2019s homes, offices, and factories. It also oversees the federal and state electricity policies and programs that shape electricity system planning and market operations. OE accomplishes its mission through research, partnerships, facilitation, modelling, and analytics. Funding interests include research, development, and demonstration of next-generation transformers, distributed energy systems, flexible and adaptable designs for power generation and transmission systems, and grid security and resilience. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) EERE\u2019s mission is to create and sustain American leadership in the transition to a global clean energy economy. It does this through several offices and programs, including: Bioenergy Technologies The Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) works to develop industrially relevant technologies to enable domestically produced biofuels and bioproducts. Efficiency The goal of EERE\u2019s Energy Efficiency program is to work with researchers and industry partners to develop innovative, cost-effective, energy-saving solutions through better power production methods, advanced materials and manufacturing processes, commercial and consumer products, new homes, ways to improve older homes, and green building designs and materials which meet the internationally-used Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system. Renewables EERE cooperates with a large network of researchers, universities, DOE national laboratories, and industry partners to develop, manufacture, and install cutting-edge, high-tech renewable energy systems, with the goal of \u201ccatalyzing the transformation of the nation\u2019s energy system\u201d to promote \u201cU.S. leadership in science and engineering as a cornerstone of our economic prosperity.\u201d Transportation Through its Vehicle, Bioenergy, and Fuel Cell Technologies Offices, EERE advances the development of next-generation technologies to make transportation cleaner and more efficient through advanced combustion engine and vehicle efficiency, innovative new transportation technologies, and solutions that put electric drive and fuel cell vehicles on the road and replace oil with clean domestic fuels. Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) The Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) provides more than $2 billion per year in non-recourse contracts and grants to small U.S.-owned companies to develop new products and services that are based on innovative, unproven concepts and technologies. The objective of the SBIR program is to support innovation that leads to the commercialization of new technologies and final products and services to benefit U.S. communities, companies, and residents. The program is broken down into three phases. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of an applicant\u2019s proposed research and research and development (R\/R&D) efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business organization prior to providing further federal support in Phase II. SBIR Phase I awards normally do not exceed $150,000 (although, in a few cases, awards may go up to $225,000) and are for projects lasting 6 to 12 months. The agencies that offer SBIR grants are as follows. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC): National Institute of Standards (NIS) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) \u2013 also offers Phase I STTR grants U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) \u2013 also offers Phase I STTR grants U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2013 also offers Phase I STTR grants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \u2013 also offers Phase I STTR grants National Science Foundation (NSF) \u2013 also offers STTR grants.

For example: The 10,000+ grants and $7.5 billion of funding offered each year by NSF focus solely on basic and applied research. The bulk of NFS\u2019s solicitations are targeted to TRLs 1-3, with a smaller number of grants for TRLs-4 and -5. focus solely on basic and applied research. The bulk of NFS\u2019s solicitations are targeted to TRLs 1-3, with a smaller number of grants for TRLs-4 and -5. The $300 million or so in annual grants available from DOE\u2019s Office of Science and ARPA-E , with few exceptions, also focus on basic and applied research and technology development. , with few exceptions, also focus on basic and applied research and technology development. Finally, the $2.5 billion offered each year through the SBIR\/STTR program focus solely on stimulating innovation and moving promising ideas and concepts up through TRL-5. While the SBIR\/STTR program is targeted to ideas and concepts that are initiated with a view toward eventual commercialization, its Phase III stage does not include any additional grant funding: focus solely on stimulating innovation and moving promising ideas and concepts up through TRL-5. While the SBIR\/STTR program is targeted to ideas and concepts that are initiated with a view toward eventual commercialization, its Phase III stage does not include any additional grant funding: Phase III Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) The objective of the SBIR\/STTR Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I\/II R\/R&D activities. The SBIR program does not fund Phase III; instead, the agencies that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program offer multiple grant and incentive funding opportunities through their standing programs and other solicitations to fund further development of the technologies, concepts and approaches that show commercial promise in Phase 1\/II R\/R&D. For some federal agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&D or production contracts for products, processes, or services intended for use by the U.S. government. Most of the agencies that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program, therefore, are potential sources of grants for TRL-6, -7, and -8: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC): National Institute of Standards (NIS) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Follow-on grants for projects funded at earlier TRL stages, as well as grants for projects applying for grants at TRL-6, also are available from: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) See description of financial support under TRL-1 above Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Other DOD grant opportunities See description of financial support under TRL-1 above U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy (FE) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Office of Energy Delivery and Reliability (OE) and Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) See description of financial support under TRL-2 above Other Federal Government Agencies beyond those listed above and those that participate in the SBIR\/STTR program have grant programs and offer funding that may assist in, or supplement other grants, in carrying out TRL-6. For a list of these agencies, see TRL-7 below. TRL-7 Demonstration-scale testing Federal funding opportunities: See the description of funding opportunities for TRL-6 above. Other funding opportunities may be available if there is a fit with your technology, concept, process, or approach, from: U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) DOC has one overarching goal: Helping the American Economy Grow. The DOC promotes job creation and economic growth, provides the data necessary to support commerce, oversees ocean and coastal navigation, and fosters innovation by setting standards and conducting foundational research and development. Of its nine bureaus, five provide occasional grant and funding opportunities that can assist with moving commerce-related and oceanic- and atmospheric-related technologies, concepts, and approaches through advanced TRLs. These include: Economic Development Administration (EDA) National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) DOI manages the nation\u2019s lands. Its current priorities are to maintain and expand conservation stewardship on public lands, sustainably develop the nation\u2019s energy and natural resources, modernize the infrastructure overseen by DOI, and promote economic development for Tribal Nations and ensure their sovereignty. Several of DOI\u2019s nine bureaus offer grants to support energy innovation, adoption, and deployment, including: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) National Park Service (NPS) Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) DOT has embarked on an aggressive program to promote sustainability in its policies, operations, investments and research and ensure that by 2020 not less than 20% of electric energy consumed by DOT comes from renewable energy sources. DOT also has made a commitment to pursue opportunities for the national transportation system that will promote energy and natural resource conservation, decrease emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and increase energy efficiency. One innovative program, the Smart Cities Challenge, selected Columbus, Ohio, in June 2016 to receive $40 million from DOT to become the first U.S. city to fully integrate innovative technologies \u2013 self-driving cars, connected vehicles, and smart sensors \u2013 into its transportation network. Another DOT initiative is exploring Renewable Energy Uses in Highway Rights of Way.

The ITC is earned when the equipment is placed into service. Production Tax Credit (PTC) The PTC reduces federal income taxes on innovative and renewable energy projects based on the electrical output (measured in kilowatt-hours, or kWh) of grid-connected renewable energy facilities. Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS) Or Bonus Depreciation allows businesses and project developers to reduce their federal taxes through a deduction for depreciation when renewable energy equipment or facilities producing renewable energy are placed into service. With the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the first-year depreciation allowance was increased from 50% to 100%. Several other types of technologies and properties that incorporate innovative concepts also are now eligible for MARCS program bonus depreciation.

Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) can be used to finance renewable energy projects using technologies that also qualify for the federal renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). CREBs may be issued by electric cooperatives, government entities (states, cities, counties, territories, Indian tribal governments or any political subdivision thereof), and certain lenders. The bondholder receives federal tax credits in lieu of a portion of the traditional bond interest, resulting in a lower effective interest rate for the borrower. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) may be used by state, local and tribal governments to finance certain types of energy projects. QECBs are qualified tax credit bonds, and in this respect, are similar to Clean Renewable Energy Bonds or CREBs. The difference is that borrower who issues the bond pays back only the principal of the bond, and the bondholder receives federal tax credits in lieu of the traditional bond interest.

Governments will initially have to play the most prominent role, because rightsizing the rare-earth market will not occur naturally\u2014that is, without regulations, policies, and financing from the public sector. Indeed, governments have a vested interest in making sure that domestic rare-earth projects are well supported whenever possible, chiefly to minimize their nation\u2019s dependence on foreign countries for these critical minerals, which are about to become even more valuable. But the private sector will quickly have to show leadership for the global market to develop in a coherent fashion. (See Exhibit 4.) Create enabling conditions to foster the development of new mines. To varying degrees, governments are already taking action. For instance, the US, through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and other measures, is offering fiscal incentives, such as tax credits, to develop domestic supply chains of critical minerals. However, these incentives are primarily directed toward midstream and downstream operations\u2014those that manufacture made-in-USA permanent magnets and electric vehicle equipment, for example. That approach leaves open the possibility of having to continue to source rare-earth ore abroad, which may stymie attempts to create an integrated supply chain in the US. For its part, Canada is focusing on its regulatory framework in the upstream area. The government recently pledged to review the permit process for rare-earth mines so as to reduce the time it takes for companies to get approval to operate. Among the key aspects of this effort would be seeking the consent of indigenous peoples early\u2014when a company is proposing to mine rare earths in a community. The Canadian government has set aside as much as $3 billion to facilitate and support new mine applications and development. In emerging regions such as Africa, it is crucial for governments to take similar actions. While Africa has significant amounts of critical minerals, it is the second-least-attractive region for mining investment (after Asia) because of a multitude of local policies and rules that can make it very difficult to get projects off the ground. African governments should take steps to create a better environment for new exploration and investment in downstream operations by designing consistent rules for the mineral-rights application process that cannot be easily confounded by local bureaucracies. For example, there have been instances of local authorities rescinding mining permits well after projects were underway and millions of dollars were spent. In addition, considering the global need for rare-earth reserves, African governments could seek support from international agencies for geo-mapping remote areas to uncover potentially viable locations for mining. In Europe, new mining projects must undergo increasingly extensive environmental impact assessments. However, for rare-earth production to be widely adopted in these and other developed economies, governments should implement regulatory frameworks that guarantee minimal environmental impact to overcome local populations\u2019 opposition to mining. Techniques that minimize damage to the environment include using a renewable source for onsite energy, implementing water recycling and reclamation, and strictly containing and disposing of toxic waste, such as the tailings from rare-earth extraction. Finally, governments will have to invest in education and training to develop workforces with the high level of geological and chemical processing skills and expertise necessary for rare-earth projects. Funding for infrastructure improvements\u2014building reliable roads, constructing power grids, and sourcing energy\u2014is also essential. Target investments directly toward upstream rare-earth mining. Because of long lead times\u2014up to five years\u2014to develop a rare-earth mine, upstream operations should be initiated immediately. China, of course, has a robust rare-earth sector, but in Europe and North America, progress toward upstream mining has been slow. For its part, the European Union recently put forward a set of actions under the Critical Raw Materials Act that would accelerate critical mining activities in the EU. Under the proposed rules, at least 10% of the EU\u2019s annual consumption of critical raw materials would be met by domestic extraction, and \u201cnot more than 65% of the Union\u2019s annual consumption of each strategic raw material at any relevant stage of processing [could come] from a single third country.\u201d While that legislation may close the rare-earth supply gap a bit, EU financing regulations that govern the types of projects that can be called environmentally friendly do not help because they omit mining. As a result, green investors will be reluctant to put their money in rare-earth efforts, even though it is essential for EU countries to open new mines to source rare earths for the wind turbines and electric vehicles that are required for the EU\u2019s energy transition ambitions. Quasi-government and multilateral entities could use their lending arms to provide investments, loans, or guaranties to new projects. Public-private partnerships could be perfect vehicles for funding rare-earth mines. Quasi-government and multilateral entities\u2014including development banks (such as the IFC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and development agencies (such as the German Agency for International Cooperation)\u2014could use their lending arms to provide investments, loans, or guaranties to new projects. Perhaps the most effective example of a public-private partnership took place in Japan in 2010 when a political dispute with China threatened Japan\u2019s supply of rare earths. To protect against this potential shortfall, the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security, an independent administrative unit of the government, extended a low-interest loan to Australia\u2019s Lynas Rare Earths, which was relatively new in rare-earth mining at the time. Within three years, Lynas had overcome technical problems and was routinely producing rare-earth metals in its Malaysian facility. This financial agreement effectively helped Japan to shore up its supply of rare earths. Improve transparency in the rare-earth mining sector to catalyze commercial opportunities. The recently created French Observatory of Mineral Resources for Industrial Sectors is a public-private group charged with developing technical, economic, and strategic analyses pertaining to critical raw materials. These assessments are intended to provide various levels of the French government and organizations in the industrial sector with sufficient information to make decisions, including ones about planning new mining ventures and adjusting supply and demand. Similar ventures are needed in other global economies. By collaborating, members in a public-private group could monitor and chart both the production of critical-mineral projects at various stages of development and the downstream companies that may buy the elements. Members could also match possible commercial partners to codevelop mining projects, create communities for knowledge sharing, and encourage research and development in best practices, including ones for environmentally sound approaches. In addition, members could draw up business models and strategies and lay out roadmaps for investing in rare-earth mines. At the international level, global economies should create a multilateral agency like the International Energy Agency. Focused on critical raw materials, the agency would create more global transparency about supply and demand, the status of new and existing projects, and supply chain effectiveness. Governments and public-private consortia should spawn regional alliances to ensure global cooperation and share risk. Forge regional and private partnerships to share the effort and the risk. There is only so much that countries can do alone. It is important for governments and public-private consortia to spawn regional alliances to support rare-earth sector growth, ensure global cooperation, and share risk. For instance, a multinational consortium could establish a mine in Australia, processing capabilities in Europe, and downstream production in the US\u2014with financing and output equally divided among the participants. Such a broad alliance could collaborate in setting goals for the project\u2019s environmental benchmarks, inter-regional trade, and sharing R&D and market expertise\u2014all facets that need to be standardized globally to expand activity and performance in the rare-earth sector. Companies can create individual partnerships as well. Downstream companies need to be certain that they have reliable rare-earth supplies to manufacture their components, and upstream players must be assured of outlets for their mining output. Locking in critical-metal sources now, even before demand has evolved but anticipating future market growth, would boost new mining projects and close the supply gap that will otherwise develop over the next decade. For example, General Motors and General Electric have a joint arrangement to purchase rare earths in the coming years from Australia\u2019s Arafura Rare Earths. Despite this agreement, both GM and GE do not yet have capabilities to create permanent magnets from the metals, but they want to assure supply availability for strategic initiatives pivotal to their growth. Develop recycling programs for rare-earth elements. Creating reuse programs for rare earths in end-of-life products is imperative. Recycling can increase the amount of rare earths available for manufacturing permanent magnets and create a new source of supply of these scarce commodities. Currently, there are no at-scale recycling programs that separate out rare-earth metals, although some IT equipment, large appliances, and electric vehicle components with permanent magnets are repurposed. To make sure that the rare earths are isolated and recycled, governments need to establish standards to ensure that manufacturers design their products to facilitate reuse. Governments also need to create incentives to trigger investments in recycling facilities. Rare-earth recycling is in its early stages, and financial support or tax deductions will be needed to encourage companies to get into an energy-intensive and, therefore, costly endeavor with only limited amounts of minerals available for recycling. The incentives would ideally catalyze collaboration among midstream and downstream rare-earth players to develop the recycling market in a way that builds efficiency into the process; reduces costs for both the recycler purchasing the end-of-life products and the manufacturer buying the recycled minerals; and allows for a pricing structure that generates consistent profits. It is unrealistic to think that the development of downstream rare-earth demand alone will drive ample growth in upstream capacity. To close the supply gap, aggressive and purposeful action will be necessary. In particular, governments will have to show leadership and provide sufficient support to kick-start desperately needed rare-earth initiatives\u2014and, in turn, public-private coalitions involving all parts of the value chain must more aggressively develop new projects and accelerate existing ones. The rare-earth shortage may not be uppermost in people\u2019s minds now, but it must be resolved\u2014or it will become a bottleneck, significantly limiting the world\u2019s chances to meet its carbon emissions goals.

Yeah. India has been very clear. In fact, before joining this particular post, I was the secretary environment and climate change and I was the deputy leader of the Indian subcontinent when I was the deputy leader in Glasgow and 2021. So this sector is nothing new to me. Only thing is now I am dealing with the nitty gritty of it. SECHE which I am hearing correctly, is now one of the organisers and which brought about the transparency, which brought about the development and facilitation of renewable energy in India. T Vendors basically was set up about a decade back. That time the solar price had to be high, but India had decided that we will get into the renewable energy and facilitate and put it there. So the psyche gaming will be we devise the very transparent bidding systems that has already set it and now we are looking forward to skilling scaling up along with our sister organisations like Ntpc SBG, and whether our medicines mix will ensure that we get into the promised goal, which our Prime Minister had a tool that will meet off 50% of the total electrical installed capacity coming coming from renewable. That roughly translates into pioneer gigawatt of historic capacity by 30. We are very assured that we will be not only doing it, but we will be definitely surpassing it. And how do you make renewable energy then attractive to power utilities? Because they need, I suppose, to replace their fossil fuel capacity and they need to have a constant, a ready guaranteed supply. Do they not? That right? See what happened in the earlier years of renewable energy development, particularly solar and wind. The grid, which is totally dependent on it, is developing a kind of a base load kind of energy from coal and gas and nuclear. So it had plenty of the capacity to absorb that very well. Renewable energy. But no, we are currently roughly about. 22.5% of our total electric electrical energy is coming from renewable sources. That is, we are know there is need for setting up the electrical storage system and looking at this. We have the Solar Energy Corporation and Gauteng to getting the US storage system set up at different places. And we are also experimenting with new products like round the clock renewable energy on the main kind of renewable energy. Definitely a major impact on the cost for discoms, but as the country is determined that we have to fulfil our international obligations and that's why we are now getting into these different kind of projects so that the renewable energy is the now become the foremost energy supply. Everybody that electrical energy is concerned out discos. Fortunately, they don't have to displace the thermal power devices, only those thermal power stations which have become or they will not be new and no new power would be set up. So that total energy demand, which is increasing at a pace that the total energy that will be paid up into the new. Gupta talked to us about the innovations at Saki to meet the emerging needs of customers. Yeah, I already told you. Renewable energy is normally a variable energy analyst or a company with the excluded systems, or they are innovatively solar and innovatively combined along with the storage system. Now that is what we are doing. Now we are aggregating that demand from the state, utilising that complementarity. Somebody needs some states needs power, in some regions, somebody needs it. What about it, B2C. So we are exploiting those complementarities and also setting up the systems like a storage system so they could say either exit round the clock energy or the kind of on demand energy. This becomes almost parallel to that thermal energy, which then our ability to are accustomed. So we are providing these customers solutions for their requirement. And by combining with the most of the states or also around the storage systems. That's how we are becoming a bit distorted with the individual products, which had been the hallmark of safety for lignite. The energy storage that you're talking about. Will it be affordable? Because that's key for decarbonisation. See, we are not especially making any particular kind of an to the system. We are asking for that. What is that energy requirement that different times and different time of the year? It's for for the better to innovate and provide the energy storage system, which he thinks would suit the requirement of demand, which all the big that we are putting up. Of course, the storage systems currently are costly, but as we said, to let energy, wind energy quite costly earlier in the scale. The prices have come down. We are actually we are entering into this storage system as space of system will be costly to begin with. But as we go along, the coast are likely to come down and help the renewable energy systems, the electric systems do a job that more and more of a dual energy grid is up very quickly. What about hydrogen and how are you dealing with that? We are the nodal agency for promoting hydrogen, and we have floated the bids for a hydrogen production of about one 1 million tonne in Adelaide for ELECTROLYZER manufacturing. That's how the two books have been floated, which we feel and are looking at the response. But we have hope that we will be able to do it. So this is the cost of building hydrogen. We will be aggregating the hydrogen demand and also we will be the builders. They would also push the hydrogen depending on the market situation. So I think we are quite hopeful about pushing the hydrogen there and that even the 5 million tonne of hydrogen production base in Belgium.","filter_flag":1}

When asked in an informal poll about what people in Delaware do about climate change, many respondents shared that they do recycle! So, how does this recycling help address climate change? Conserving energy Recycling not only helps to reduce the amount of waste entering landfills, as composting does, but it also helps to save a considerable amount of energy and conserve our natural resources. For example, the energy used to make one aluminum can is equivalent to making 20 cans from recycled aluminum materials. Making new products from virgin materials that we directly mine from the earth or harvest from the land and then process, manufacture, and transport is energy-intensive and strains our natural resources. Greenhouse gasses are emitted when nonrenewable energy sources like oil, natural gas, and coal are used. A better alternative would be to ues renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric or geothermal sources. Reducing greenhouse gasses Using recycled materials is much better for the environment because it minimizes the impact on the earth and reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. Thus, while keeping your recyclable waste out of the trash stream is good for the environment and the climate, it is also essential for us to be educated and informed consumers so that we purchase products made of recycled materials. By doing so, we further help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help to mitigate (or reduce the effects of) climate change. However, one of the problems we face today in the United States is that many people do not know how to recycle properly: Even though 75% of our waste is recyclable, we only recycle 34% of recyclable materials. People regularly place non-recyclable materials into recycling bins. According to DSWA, when non-recyclable materials are sent to recycling facilities, they contaminate the recycling stream and result in what could have been materials sent to be recycled getting sent to landfills instead. This means we are missing opportunities to collectively address climate change. Improving knowledge To cut the vicious circle of creating waste, acquiring appropriate knowledge about recycling is very important. In Delaware, we use single-stream recycling. All recyclable materials should be put into the same recycling bin. It is important, too, to roughly wash the things so that they will not contaminate other materials and keep the lids on. You can learn more about the recycling process and what materials are accespted in your area with these resources from the Delaware Solid Waste Authority.","filter_flag":1}

These places promote strategies like the sharing economy to recycle, reuse, and share goods and services with the goal to lessen the demand for new products and facilitate a more equitable distribution of assets. Sharing platforms and initiatives provide collaborative and financial swapping opportunities and support community building and entrepreneurship. The sharing economy and the circular city concept provide a framework for sustainable urban development. Prosperous circular cities incorporate various strategies, including renewable energy, green buildings, and urban agriculture. Parking is also a critical aspect of sustainable transportation. Municipalities must integrate parking solutions that align with circular economy principles to create a more efficient and greener metropolis. Why is Amsterdam a circular city? According to the city of Amsterdam's website, Amsterdam provides all residents with a superior quality of life while respecting the earth's natural resources and boundaries. As a circular city, Amsterdam is adopting a more thoughtful approach to scarce new materials and changing how it produces and consumes. Amsterdam aims to become a 100% circular economy by 2050, with interim targets of halving its use of new raw materials by 2030 and changing all public procurement to be circular by 2025. The city's ambitions focus on three key sectors: food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment. The city plans to achieve this by: Shortening food chains to provide a robust regional food system Improving the processing of organic waste streams Promoting the use of recycled and reusable materials in construction Challenging the market to innovate through circular criteria Amsterdam recognises that building a circular economy requires cooperation and actions from different industries. The city collaborates with local organisations, residents, and businesses to promote a cleaner and more equitable world. One initiative is transitioning from taxing labour to taxing raw materials and energy. These efforts involve not only the public and private sectors but also individual citizens who play an essential role in shaping a sustainable future. Amsterdam has implemented many circular economy projects over the years, including: Stadspas Discount Card: This card provides low-income individuals access to discounted arts and cultural events, fitness services, and more. Green Dot: A programme that discounts clothing repairs at participating businesses for those with a Stadspas Discount Card. Buiksloterham: An Amsterdam-Noord neighbourhood that is being developed entirely on circular principles. OpenResearch Amsterdam: An online platform that facilitates collaboration and knowledge-sharing among researchers, policymakers, and citizens to address urban challenges and create innovative solutions for the city. Parking Initiatives: There are parking platforms that connect people looking for rental spots with those with a space to spare. C-B\u00e8ta is a circular hotspot exploring ways to turn underutilised parking lots into green spaces. The Amsterdam Smart City initiative is working on a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) project, which encourages a range of transport options to diminish the need for individual car ownership and parking. Rethinking parking for a circular economy Parking is an essential aspect of urban planning and transportation. The circular economy allows us to reconsider how we approach parking by optimising the use of existing spots and creating new revenue streams and business models. Shared parking marketplaces allow drivers to find and reserve parking spaces easily. Reserving parking can also help diminish traffic congestion, as smart software directs drivers to available spaces without having to hunt for spots. Parking rental apps help reduce the costs and environmental impacts of building new parking infrastructure. By maximising existing parking spaces, cities can avoid the need to construct costly new parking facilities, which can consume significant resources and contribute to urban sprawl. Online marketplaces help cities optimise their land use, reduce congestion, and improve the quality of life for their citizens. Online parking technology also benefits property owners by unlocking new revenue streams and creating opportunities for businesses to monetise their parking spaces. Those with empty spots can generate income and increase the value of their assets by listing unused parking on these platforms. Parking marketplaces foster innovation and entrepreneurship as they create new opportunities for startups and businesses to develop products and services related to urban mobility and parking. These apps and websites drive economic growth and job creation. The circular economy also provides opportunities to create new business models around parking. Several cities are exploring using vacant parking spaces for urban agriculture, solar energy generation, and other innovative uses. By repurposing these spaces, cities can create new financial opportunities while reducing the environmental impact of parking. The sharing economy helps achieve a more sustainable and liveable environment by encouraging the use of existing, underutilised parking spots. Repurposing empty spaces creates new business opportunities, eliminates the need for new infrastructure, and fosters an eco-friendlier urban setting.","filter_flag":1}

Emerald\u2019s business model is a high-premium, low-volume operation, Jordan confirms. \u201cWe have the ability to take substantial lead lines and utilise our broad facultative reinsurance relationships to place large capacity behind risks. While certain accounts have many complexities, this model allows us to punch well above our weight.\u201d It also helps that Emerald has the ability to underwrite risks outside South Africa using a Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) AA rating, which is higher than SA\u2019s current sovereign rating of BB-. This has been facilitated by Santam and Emerald entering into a credit wrap agreement with Swiss-based New Reinsurance Company Limited (NewRe), a subsidiary of Munich Re. While Emerald can estimate that it currently accounts for in excess of 30% of the SA corporate property market share, the African market presents a far more diverse range of industries. \u201cLargely, we will continue to focus on mining, heavy industry, ports (both marine and air), telecoms, and the big-scale property market. And again, the renewable energy sector is exciting,\u201d says Jordan.

Enveloping over 70% of planet\u2019s surface, oceans regulate weather and climate patterns. More than 70% of earth oxygen generation is undertaken by algae in oceans. Humanity has depended on oceans for sustenance, progression, and survival. The rapid growth in human population and subsequent increment of human economic foot print is straining our continental resources. The menace of pollution is damaging our planet, putting the human well-being and even existence in danger. This has necessitated restructuring the way we interact with our planet in general and oceans in particular. As humanity\u2019s relationship with the ocean is getting increasingly demanding, therefore, new concepts are needed for revitalization of oceans in the way which is sustainable, progressive, and secure. Blue Economy provides the framework for synchronization of economic prosperity with the sustainability of nature. First coined by Gunter Pauli, the lynchpin of Blue Economy is sustainability. It deals with sustainable use of oceans for improved livelihood and economic growth without compromising the ocean health. Blue Economic model has direct compatibility with five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) crafted by United Nations. These five SDGs include eradication of poverty (SDG-01), ensuring of good health and well-being (SDG-03), emphasis on innovation and infrastructure development (SDG-09), undertaking climate action (SDG-13) and safeguarding of life below water (SDG-14). The potential of the Blue Economy is enormous. In 2010, the Global Oceanic Economy was valued at approximately 1.5 trillion USD, and by 2030, it is expected to surpass the 3 trillion USD mark. The net worth of Oceanic assets is estimated to be 24 trillion USD. Oceanic resources are vast but not unlimited. Therefore, sustenance of resources is essential. Blue Economy offers more reliable and credible alternative to traditional ocean based economic model. It deals with maritime economic professions like fisheries, resource extraction, marine transportation, and tourism, but within the bindings of ecofriendly regulations. Plus, it incorporates practices, like aquaculture\/mariculture, blue biotech, and renewable energy production from oceans, for improving productivity while retaining minimum impact on marine ecosystem. One of the fundamental pillars of the Blue Economy is the promotion of sustainable fisheries. In 2022, global sea food market was valued more than 257 Billion USD. It\u2019s projected to reach 350 Billion by 2027. Overfishing is rapidly depleting fish stocks and is disrupting marine ecosystems. To address the growing demand for seafood and alleviate pressure on wild fish stocks, the Blue Economy encourages the development of sustainable aquaculture and mariculture practices. These modern fish farming practises involve raising fish stocks and other marine lives like aquatic plants in controlled environment. By adopting these practises on global scale, we can reduce our reliance on wild fisheries while ensuring a consistent supply of seafood. In parallel, aquaculture and mariculture have the potential of generating more financial revenue than traditional fish catching practises. Currently Global aquaculture market is valued approximately USD 289.6 Billion and is expected to reach USD 421.2 Billion by end of 2030. The Blue Economy recognizes the vast potential of oceans as a renewable energy source. Offshore wind farming, tidal, and wave energy offer a sustainable alternative to carbon-based energy sources. In practise, offshore wind turbines are more efficient than onshore wind turbines. Horsea Wind Farm, located roughly 89 kms off the coast of Yorkshire, UK, is currently the largest wind farm in world. It can produce 1.3 GW of clean energy. By middle of this century, European Union is targeting to achieve 300GW energy generation from offshore wind farming. Similarly, it is estimated that 120-400 GW energy can be made available to mankind through tidal waves alone. The International Energy Agency\u2019s calculations suggest that ocean waves are capable of producing 8,000 \u2013 80,000 TW yearly. Clean ocean energy technologies may have high capital cost, but by harnessing enormous power of oceans we will not only foster a clean energy transition but also fulfil our immense energy requirements for generations. The Blue Economy encourages sustainable tourism practices that balance economic benefits with environmental conservation. The net contribution of global tourism and travel industry is approximately USD 5.8 trillion. Coastal and marine tourism constitute roughly half (50%) of net global tourism. These statistics proves that tourism is a major contributor to global economy, but its unregulated expansion can harm ecosystems. By promoting eco-friendly tourism, and marine conservation initiatives, we can create a positive feedback loop. Thriving ecosystems attract visitors, who, in turn, contribute to conservation efforts and generate revenue for local communities. The Blue Economy also promotes marine biotechnology \u2013 a new technological sector. Marine ecosystem is predominately unexplored and has rich biodiversity. Marine organisms contain natural compounds which can be used for developing new products like biomaterials, biofuels, biomedicines, and other innovations etc. Many such bio products are already in use in the fields of health care, livestock, industrial manufacturing, and transportation. Moreover, this technology is now being used to enhance the productivity of aquaculture and mariculture. For entire marine biotechnology sector, it\u2019s difficult to gauge its precise economic worth as it encompasses vast range of activities. Investing in research and development of marine biotechnology will not only drive economic growth but also contribute to the well-being of humanity and the conservation of marine ecosystems. Since humanity is intrinsically tied to the oceans, it is in the individual\u2019s best interest to act collectively to benefit from global commons. Such planning requires collaboration among local communities, industries, governments, and global organizations. Blue Economy has the potential to resolve our problems associated with economic growth and climate change. To protect and better utilize oceans in a sustainable manner, we must establish equilibrium \u2013 one rooted in true understanding of oceans and its relation with humanity. For that we have to periodically adopt sustainable fisheries, promote aquaculture, unlock renewable oceanic energy resources, harness marine biotechnology, practice responsible tourism, and implement effective governance. By bringing together our knowledge and efforts related to Blue Economy, we will be able revitalize our oceans and thus secure a better future. (1007)","filter_flag":1}

Under his leadership, Magicbricks has developed cutting edge products and solutions which solve deep rooted problems in the real estate sector. He has been instrumental in scaling up Magicbricks and taking it up to a clear leadership position within the hotly contested online real estate portal segment in India. He is an avid reader, trekker and is passionate about new products and emerging business models in the consumer internet space. LESS ... MORE India\u2019s economy is projected to grow at a rate of 6.5% in FY24, according to the latest Economic Survey (2022-23). This growth is expected to drive up energy demand in the country, particularly as its population is set to reach 1.5 billion by 2030. To ensure sustainability in this changing landscape, the real estate sector must adopt new technologies to make its practices more sustainable, especially as it accounts for 22% of energy demand in India. Recognizing the growing impact of climate change, and the pioneering role that India can play in this regard, the government has already launched several initiatives to promote sustainable energy. Apart from the National Solar Mission and the Energy Conservation Building Code, India also made commitments towards net zero carbon emissions at the COP26 held in 2022. The real estate industry, accounting for almost 40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, has a critical role to play in mitigating climate change. Green buildings and sustainable architecture are the future of real estate, providing promising environmental and economic impact. With technological advancements, there is an opportunity to build a viable future and elevate the well-being of real estate developers. On National Technology Day, here are top technologies that are changing the present and future of real-estate as we know! Smart Building Systems Smart building systems, in particular, are making a significant contribution to sustainability by converging various building-wide systems into one IT-enabled infrastructure using digital technologies. With an estimated global market value of over $500 billion by 2032, the demand for smart buildings is rapidly growing. Using AI\/ML, smart building systems optimize energy consumption by aligning schedules and intelligently predicting approaches. They also monitor building performance and identify impending failures with real-time analysis, making the infrastructure both smart and secure. For example, occupancy sensors may turn off lights and adjust the temperature in unoccupied rooms, reducing energy waste. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can predict and optimize energy usage based on weather patterns, occupancy, and other factors. This is a fast catching up phenomenon in India and several developers are already leveraging this technology. Renewable energy in vogue Renewable energy, such as solar power, has become a popular topic in recent years due to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Moreover, advances in battery technology have made it possible to store renewable energy, enabling buildings to operate entirely on clean energy throughout the year. Mumbai is making strides, and a first of its kind solar power plant to cater exclusively to residential society would soon be operational, and is expected to reduce energy costs by 40%! Solar energy is already being explored for part operations in societies such as for operating lifts or lighting in common areas through solar panel roofs, generally of 25KW capacity. To facilitate transition to renewable energy, frameworks and guidelines such as The Greenhouse Gas Protocol have been developed to assist stakeholders in optimizing energy usage. This protocol also guides developers in adopting strategies such as virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), green energy credits, net metering, and Green Tariff mechanisms to promote the use of renewable sources of energy. Green Construction Technologies As the world becomes increasingly focused on sustainability and combating climate change, technology advancements are playing a critical role in creating eco-friendly construction materials. These advancements span from energy-efficient appliances to geothermal heating systems. One of the most promising eco-friendly materials is cellulose insulation, which is made up of 75-80% recycled material, including newspapers. This insulation material is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to fiberglass insulation, which is commonly used in buildings today. In addition to reducing waste, cellulose insulation provides superior insulation and soundproofing, making it an attractive option for builders. Another promising technology is the development of new construction materials that can capture and store carbon dioxide. This innovation could have a significant impact on reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Researchers are experimenting with various materials, such as concrete, that can capture CO2 emissions from industrial processes and store them indefinitely. This process, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the construction industry, which is responsible for approximately 39% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, new sustainable construction materials are being developed with renewable resources, such as bamboo, hemp, and mycelium. These materials have a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional materials like steel and concrete. AI powered tools Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the real estate industry by optimizing building performance, reducing energy consumption, and promoting sustainability. AI-powered energy auditing tools analyze consumption patterns and provide recommendations for energy-efficient upgrades, helping building owners save on costs and reduce their carbon footprint. AI-driven waste management systems analyze data from sensors to predict waste production patterns and optimize collection schedules, reducing environmental impact and costs. Occupancy optimization tools optimize lighting, HVAC, and other systems based on occupancy patterns, improving energy efficiency, particularly in commercial buildings. Integration of technology opens more avenues of incorporating sustainable measures , such as setting up charging stations for electric vehicles in parking lots, encouraging the use of sustainable practices and reducing carbon footprints. The primary challenge in technology-adoption is lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders, and technical expertise and resources to implement these solutions effectively. However, there are growing efforts to facilitate the creation of industry-specific clusters that bring together technology startups, investors, and construction firms to create an ecosystem of innovation. Another challenge is the initial high cost but there is growing sensitivity that the ROI in the long run offsets the initial investment. A study by the World Economic Forum substantiates that digital technologies can renovate ten times the space of traditional technologies within the same budget. The cost of investment can be recouped in less than five years compared to passive energy-efficient solutions, which may take up to 15 years. There are also tax incentives to builders who use sustainable construction materials and technology solutions. As we look towards a more sustainable future, it\u2019s clear that technology will be a key driver of change in the real estate industry and there are countless examples of the same. To fully embrace these technologies, we need to invest in research & development, awareness and collaboration to create innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of this industry.

NMIS, which is operated by the University of Strathclyde, is linking up with ETZ Ltd, the not-for-profit company tasked with spearheading North East Scotland\u2019s energy transition ambition, the Net Zero Technology Centre (NZTC), and founding partners bp and Scottish Enterprise, to create a \u00a36.5 million 3,000sqm facility to support supply chain expansion and deliver a \u2018cutting-edge innovation ecosystem\u2019. The facility will be the focal point of the Innovation Campus, one of five specialist campuses being developed across Aberdeen\u2019s Energy Transition Zone which will become the largest dedicated energy transition complex in Scotland. Located at Hareness Road in Altens Industrial Estate, the hub will comprise of flexible industrial and collaboration space that will foster manufacturing, supply chain company building, technology research and development and commercialisation, alongside targeted business support to drive entrepreneurship, innovation and growth. Subject to planning permission, its opening is expected to be in late 2024. As a delivery partner for EISH NMIS will provide early-stage and scaling companies involved in innovative green energy technology solutions with a comprehensive package of advice and support to help them accelerate the journey to get their products to market. Energy transition NMIS will establish an outreach centre as part of EISH to create a presence in the North East and occupy a significant workshop in the collaboration hub within the facility. NZTC will locate TechX accelerator start-ups in the hub and provide them with support to grow their businesses and be part of an environment where they can engage and collaborate with peers, SMEs and larger companies all equally involved in accelerating the drive to net zero. ETZ Ltd has received \u00a31.25m from bp and \u00a32m support from Scotland\u2019s national economic development agency Scottish Enterprise to begin construction of the hub and the remaining \u00a33.25m of the capital funding for the project will be supported through the Scottish Government\u2019s Energy Transition Fund. Professor Sir Jim McDonald, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde, said: \u201cAs a leading international technological University, Strathclyde is committed to applying its knowledge and research to the achievement of a net zero economy. \u201cAs the operator of NMIS we are excited to be to working with industry partners on the Energy Incubator and Scale-Up Hub and bringing our expertise in research, innovation and skills development to the Energy Transition Zone.\u201d Chris Courtney, CEO of the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS) said: \u201cWe are delighted to enter into this partnership with NZTC, BP and Scottish Enterprise to help incubate and grow ambitious and innovative companies that will create new products and services to drive the energy transition. \u201cThrough our extensive experience in collaborative innovation and strong entrepreneurial approach, we can help companies develop their ideas, create networks, and access new markets for their products. Together we can build on the solid industrial heritage in Aberdeen and the northeast and grow new companies to drive the move towards renewable energy in Scotland, the UK and beyond.\u201d Economic opportunities Gillian Martin, Scottish Government Minister for Energy and the Environment, said: \u201cThis government is investing almost \u00a35 billion in the net zero energy economy in Scotland over this parliamentary term. One of our vehicles for supporting a fair and just transition for the North East\u2019s oil and gas economy to net zero is the \u00a375m Energy Transition Fund. This investment is helping the region attract private investment in the energy transition and maximise the economic opportunities offered by the low-carbon and renewable energy sector. \u201cScotland\u2019s first Energy Incubator and Scale Up Hub is an excellent example of this action, with the public and private sector working together to accelerate the growth of start-up companies working in the green energy space. I look forward to seeing work progress towards next year\u2019s launch date and welcome the new partners \u2013 NZTC and NMIS \u2013 who have come on board.\u201d Maggie McGinlay, Chief Executive, ETZ Ltd, said: \u201cInnovation lies at the heart of the energy transition and the Energy Incubator and Scale Up Hub will enable us to expand our vital energy supply chain which is why EISH is integral to the Innovation Campus and Energy Transition Zone. \u201cThe involvement of NZTC and NMIS together with the support from bp and Scottish Enterprise for this major project demonstrates how important collaboration between industry and government is in driving the energy transition with the ultimate goal being to create sustainable jobs and company growth. \u201cAberdeen has always been renowned for its entrepreneurial focus in energy - home to largest concentration of energy supply chain companies in UK - and this centre will ensure we continue to support innovation and technology as we move into green energy solutions.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Results from a recent research project are indicating that better plastic recycling in the aquaculture sector is possible. It is believed that the sector can reduce waste and simultaneously generate wealth by recycling its industrial hard plastics. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into everything from administrative terms of reference to rules and regulations, the current state of our knowledge and, not least, levels of acceptance within the industry,\u201d said SINTEF researcher Sigrid Damman. \u201cThese factors are just as important as any technological developments.\u201d Specific recommendations to the aquaculture sector Creating a circular economy is a complex process. First, there needs to be an awareness of the opportunities available when utilising a resource. Stable and regulatory frameworks must also be put into place. This will enable us to use new materials and products without entailing high levels of risk. As well as this, the right legislation and regulations must be implemented to facilitate new initiatives. Now, researchers are presenting specific recommendations both to the aquaculture sector and the public authorities. What is the POCOplast project? The team are working on a project called POCOplast, an abbreviation of \u201cPathways to sustainable post-consumer plastics in aquaculture.\u201d The project was established to look into all aspects of the value chain, and how to better plastic recycling in the aquaculture sector. Researchers at SINTEF have been working with seven partners to conduct a thorough analysis based in part on almost 30 interviews with a variety of stakeholders. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into what goes on among the various actors in the value chain, and have also tried to understand the barriers that exist in the current regulations,\u201d said Damman. The project is set to be completed in autumn 2023. The EU has made amendments to its regulations The EU has already made a number of amendments to its rules and regulations and is also offering more funding for research. \u201cPerhaps we can go even further by requiring that recycled plastic material be incorporated during the manufacture of industrial plastic products,\u201d said Damman. \u201cThis will boost development, but it will be a bad move to stipulate new requirements before we\u2019re sure that we have sufficient capacity in place. Nevertheless, we ought to be setting more specific targets for the levels of incorporation of recycled material in the manufacture of industrial hard plastics.\u201d Many companies are interested in plastic recycling and developing new products. However, they are demanding greater assurances when it comes to materials flow. \u201cFor example, it\u2019s crucial to users of the material that they have reliable access to products of uniform quality. \u201cAnd those who receive the plastics for recycling have to know that there is sufficient demand. They also need to understand, and be able to document, that they are supplying plastic that meets the needs of their own customers,\u201d said Damman. The key to success: Greater responsibility for manufacturers The team believe that the introduction of new arrangements that place greater levels of responsibility with the manufacturers is the key to success. An arrangement like this will be in place before the end of 2024. It will entail manufacturers assuming complete responsibility for the life cycle of entire products. There is also talk of introducing funding programmes that will make it commercially viable to design products that are suitable for recycling. \u201cThe happy outcome of all this is that we will be able to create new products, and jobs in the districts, based on resources that were previously classified as waste. \u201cThe most important thing here is to set targets for materials recycling, including industrial hard plastics,\u201d said Damman. \u201cThis will offer greater predictability, which will in turn encourage a greater willingness among actors to invest in circular economy systems. \u201cWe need to stipulate clearer requirements for the recycling of all plastics, including hard industrial plastics. Current requirements offer only the wording \u2018plastics suitable for recycling\u2019, which, of course, makes it somewhat unclear as to the materials that are included.\u201d Establishing acceptance of new materials and products To establish better plastic recycling processes in the aquaculture sector, an acceptance of new materials and products must be established. If the sector is to start using new materials and making new products, it will have assurances that they will work and that they are as reliable as existing ones. It is important to direct a focus on plastic recycling in the aquaculture sector, and that norms and standards will be developed in step with new materials and products. \u201cLast, but not least, it will be crucial to establish dialogue with the relevant public authorities,\u201d said Damman. \u201cGood intentions will be to no avail if the authorities cannot offer a regulatory framework that enables the industry to see the benefits of adopting innovative materials and products.\u201d Plastic recycling in the aquaculture sector has great importance Establishing a circular economy through plastic recycling in the aquaculture sector will be very important for many reasons. First, marine plastic waste has a negative impact on ecosystems and is harmful to marine life. A circular economy will contribute towards reducing the volumes of micro- and nanoplastics entering marine ecosystems. Circular economy initiatives are important for reducing the use of virgin plastics. This will result in less greenhouse gas emissions and will help reduce global warming. \u201cFurthermore, there will be environmental benefits linked to the fact that less plastic will be combusted or sent to landfill, where pollution due to water run-off can be a problem,\u201d said Damman. \u201cThe happy outcome of all this is that we will be able to create new products, and jobs in the districts, based on resources that were previously classified as waste.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The planned development would produce 4.5m kilograms of green hydrogen per year once fully operational in what would be a significant milestone for the Irish renewables sector. The project, known as Firlough, on the Mayo-Sligo border has already been deemed of national strategic importance to the state and the area by ABP. Its projected output would be enough to fuel 16,665 cars, 667 lorries, 1,397 buses or 125 trains per year. The hydrogen plan will use renewable energy from the Firlough wind farm to split water into environmentally-friendly green hydrogen and oxygen with no emissions or harmful by-products through a process called electrolysis. The planning application consists of a 78MW, 13-turbine wind farm as well as the proposed hydrogen plant, which is expected to create between 100 to 150 jobs during construction and between 10 to 20 further full time and part time jobs on completion. Business Bulletin \"We started investigating the feasibility of producing green hydrogen in the West of Ireland back in 2020, mostly due to its world class wind resource but also because of the surplus electricity the Firlough Wind Farm is expected to produce,\" said Tim Bills-Everett, COO of Mercury Renewables. \"Our Firlough Wind Farm and Green Hydrogen project will act as a catalyst to attract new business to the region, potentially creating hundreds of new jobs in addition to those directly related to the project,\" he continued. \"Firlough represents a significant step forward in establishing an Irish Green Hydrogen economy, with the West of Ireland at the forefront. We are already in discussions with several multinational companies regarding the supply of our green hydrogen for use in transportation and industry.\u201d The announcement comes after Bord Na M\u00f3na received planning permission for a 2MW pilot-scale hydrogen electrolysis plant in Mount Lucas, Co Offaly and the launch of the government's National Hydrogen Strategy earlier this week. \"We are delighted to see the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications share our vision in the National Hydrogen Strategy under its banner of Kickstarting Production,\" said Bills-Everett. \"Our primary focus since the feasibility study has been to decarbonise the transportation sector \u2013 both road and non-road mobility \u2013 as a critical green hydrogen use case for Ireland. Mercury is encouraged to see the National Hydrogen Strategy mirror this focus.\" Mercury Renewables hopes the project will commence operations during 2025, but warned that the actual date will be largely dependent on the time required by An Bord Plean\u00e1la to complete their assessment of the application. Mercury Renewables has submitted the first Strategic Infrastructure Development application. In 2013, the company received planning permission for 21 wind turbines at the Firlough Wind Farm site which is zoned for renewable energy development. However, due to grid constraints and the enormous potential for green hydrogen production in the region, the company then decided to seek planning for the electrolyzer plant with fewer wind turbines.

From new AI tools to major EU regulatory decisions, a lot has transpired that could spell industry-shifting change. Here we offer insight into the five latest technology trends impacting food and beverage production and the companies deploying it. AI use in food and drink manufacturing on the rise Flavours manufacturer Givaudan is utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to develop dairy-free products at its recently expanded Protein Hub in Zurich, Switzerland. Givaudan\u2019s ATOM technology uses AI to support the development of new products, with it allowing concepts to be tested and then prototyped more quickly, increasing efficiency and contributing to a better output. \"ATOM is unique to Givaudan and harnesses AI technology to enhance the taste and aromas of alternative dairy products,\u201d \u200ba Givaudan spokesperson told Food Manufacture.\u200b Meanwhile, HELL ENERGY has developed the first energy drink to be entirely created using AI. The design, recipe, tasting, taste evaluation and marketing were all determined using AI tools, while AI was also tasked with ensuring the product complies with existing industry legislation. The Budapest-based firm then put the drink through \u201crigorous quality control and blind tasting sessions\u201d\u200b, a process which proved a success with the product gaining approval from the company\u2019s employees. Dubbed HELL A.I., the drink will be available in 60 countries around the world later this summer. eNose market projected to nearly double by 2028 Analysis by Mordor Intelligence projects the electronic nose (eNose) market to be worth $46.51m (\u00a336.52m) by 2028, with it currently valued at $23.98m (\u00a318.83m). eNoses can be used to detect odourless chemicals, providing several functions for the food and drink manufacturing sector, such as shelf-life evaluations and quality control. Firms currently operating in the space include Alpha MOS, Plasmion GmbH, The eNose Company, Odotech and Airsense Analytics. Mordor Intelligence predicts that as the technology develops, the food and drink industry will hold a \u201csignificant market share\u200b\u201d in this area. \u201cThe technology is expected to find numerous applications in the industry, owing to the number of odour-based metrics used to measure quality, freshness, ingredients, ripeness,\u201d \u200bMordor Intelligence stated. A 2015 University of Oxford research paper by Charles Spence found that while the degree to which scent impacts taste cannot be determined precisely, smell plays a \u201cdominant\u201d\u200b role in the tasting of food. Cultivated fish and meat products getting closer European food biotech company Bluu Seafood has secured \u20ac16m (\u00a313.7m) in Series A funding to support the development of its cultivated fish products. The round was led by Sparkfood, a subsidiary of software firm Sonae. The German company creates sustainable cell-based fish meat grown in a bioreactor \u2013 without killing any fish in the process. Bluu will use the money to market the launch of its first products, in addition continuing research and development. Co-founder and chief executive, Dr Sebastian Rakers, believes that the funding is proof of the technology\u2019s \u201cenormous future potential\u200b\u201d. Rakers added: \"It also underlines the strong scientific development that Bluu Seafood and our excellent team have delivered so far. Together with our strong, international investor base, we can start the next stage of development and bring our first products to market\u200b.\" Meanwhile, the Dutch government has become the first in Europe to allow cultivated meet and seafood tastings to take place. Cultivated meat producers Meatable and Mosa Meat created a \u2018code of practice\u2019 in concert with the government enabling tasting sessions to take place under controlled conditions. \u201cWe know cultivated meat can significantly help reduce climate impact\u200b,\u201d said Meatable chief executive Krijn de Nood. \u201cBy enabling the tasting of cultivated meat, The Netherlands maintains its pioneering role in Europe and beyond\u200b.\u201d Vertical farms run on renewable energy Intelligent Growth Solutions (IGS) raised the possibility of vertical farms being run solely on renewable energy in a recent blog post. The technology firm has developed indoor vertical farming systems that are designed to deliver ideal growing conditions year-round. IGS is now exploring the possibility of these \u201cGrowth Towers\u201d\u200b being solely operated by renewable energy. IGS founder Dave Scott told Food Manufacture\u200b that powering vertical farms using renewable energy will allow food producers to cut their carbon footprint while also boosting productivity. \u201cIGS\u2019 technology has been designed as the perfect consumer of each kilowatt hour of electricity: IGS-enabled farms can integrate with both on and off-site renewables, using Cloud-based software to automatically deliver smart environmental controls and minimise energy consumption,\u201d \u200bScott added. \u201cWe\u2019ve also designed-in flexibility to our vertical farming systems to enable \u2018just in time\u2019 harvesting for our customers, ensuring they can tailor production in line with consumer demand. Rather than being forced to harvest when a crop is ready, growers can speed up or slow down growth for a short period of time, reducing waste and maximising income for the farmer\u200b.\u201d Gene editing \u2013 will the EU follow suit? The European Union is set to relax laws surrounding gene editing technology, making it easier for products developed using new genomic techniques (NGT) to reach the market. The proposed legislation would see the creation of two new pathways for the sale of NGT plants, separating them from the existing laws on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The change of stance on gene editing follows a similar move that occurred in the UK in 2021. This year has since seen the UK pass the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act which will enable the development and marketing of gene edited crops in England\u200b\u200b. \u201cNGTs can contribute to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture and food system and help reduce EU's external dependencies for agri-food production\u200b,\u201d a post on the European Commission website read. \u201cNGTs can support these objectives in multiple ways by benefitting different actors along the entire food chain.\u201d\u200b The Quadram Institute is one firm already employing gene editing technology in the UK, with ongoing projects focused on the development of healthier staple crops that will help tackle food insecurity. \u201cGene editing allows for the development of plants with improved qualities that normally take many years to produce using tradition breeding programs\u200b,\u201d said Professor Martin Warren, Quadram Institute chief scientific officer. What next? The trends highlighted above paint an exciting future in the food and drink manufacturing technology space, with the onset of AI and cultivated meats likely to play an increasingly important role in product development. The prevalence of cultivated meats, like gene edited foods, will continue to rely of legislative and regulatory change, but it appears that the winds of change are certainly blowing in one direction. Meanwhile, the way in which governments and regulators act on AI is a trend that needs to be monitored, with any alterations likely to have significant ramifications throughout the industry.","filter_flag":1}

Its subsidiary \u0160KO-ENERGO, a comprehensive energy provider for the car manufacturer and heating for the town of Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, is launching a key project to modernise the plant to use 100% biomass. The construction will begin in 2024. By transitioning to wood chips and phyto-pellets, energy production will become fully carbon neutral. With estimated costs of \u20ac141 million, the upgraded heating plant will be one of the largest projects of its kind in the Czech Republic and operational within three years. It will contribute to \u0160koda\u2019s ambitious environmental targets along the entire value chain, anchored in its Next Level \u0160koda Strategy 2030. Shift from fossil fuels to save up to 290,000 tonnes of CO2 annually The project launch is slated for the first half of 2024. A total revamp of the power plant will be carried out within three years. All boilers will exclusively use biomass, consisting of 70% wood chips and 30% phyto-pellets. The biomass will be certified according to both European and Czech legislation, emphasising the sustainability of the entire supply chain. Once the transition is complete, annual CO2 savings will amount to an estimated 290,000 tonnes per year. Currently, the power plant uses a combination of coal and biomass; \u0160KO-ENERGO first started using biomass in 2005. Since then, the proportion of eco-friendly fuel has been steadily increasing. By 2022, renewable energy sources accounted for approximately 35% of all energy used at \u0160koda Auto\u2019s Czech production plants. \u0160koda Auto has ambitious environmental goals \u0160koda Auto has tightened its environmental targets, further reducing the carbon footprint of its corporate activities. At its plants in the Czech Republic and India, the car manufacturer will be switching to completely carbon-neutral production by the end of this decade. The plant in Vrchlab\u00ed already achieved this milestone in 2020. Regarding the model portfolio, the company plans to significantly accelerate the introduction of new e-vehicles. In the coming years, it will be launching six all-electric models, with commitments to invest \u20ac5.6 billion into electromobility by 2027.

For many investors, bluechip stocks are a go-to choice as they offer stability to a portfolio. Like dividend stocks. The primary reason behind this is that these stocks are well-established, financially sound and pay regular dividends. Nevertheless, in recent times, midcaps and smallcaps have gained more attention, as they come with high growth potential compared to bluechips. While the big companies will get bigger, there are some smallcap and midcap companies that have the qualities that could make them a future bluechip stock. These companies are called emerging bluechip. We have shortlisted five such emerging blue chip companies using the Equitymaster stock screener. Let's take a look at each of them in detail... #1 LTI Mindtree First on the list is LTI Mindtree. In November 2022, Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI) merged with Mindtree to establish LTI Mindtree. This merged company is the fifth largest IT services company in terms of market capitalisation. LTI Mindtree is a global technology consulting and digital solutions company. It is engaged in the business of analysing, designing, converting and coding IT-enabled services.
