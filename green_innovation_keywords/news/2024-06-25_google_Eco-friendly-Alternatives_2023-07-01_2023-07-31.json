Overall, these trends highlight the industry\u2019s commitment to sustainability, innovation, and responsible practices. By embracing these advancements, the fashion industry can make significant strides towards a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious future. How do bacteria and microorganisms naturally produce colour, and what is the science behind harnessing their colour-producing capabilities for textile dyeing? Microorganisms have long been known to produce coloured molecules, and these discoveries have played a significant role in our understanding of early microorganism diversity. These colour molecules, known as secondary metabolites, serve specific functions within the organisms, helping them adapt and survive in stressful environments. Biotechnology, also known as biotech, utilises the principles of biology to develop new products, methods, and organisms with the aim of improving human health and society as a whole. The field of biotechnology has been present throughout human civilisation, starting from the domestication of plants and animals to the discovery of fermentation processes. By harnessing the potential of biotechnology, we can explore the vast diversity of microorganisms and their colour-producing capabilities.

Biotechnology continues to drive innovation and advancement, offering new possibilities for various industries and contributing to a more sustainable and technologically advanced future. What are some emerging trends and innovations in the field of bacterial dyeing? In recent years, there has been a growing interest in alternative dyeing methods that utilise living bacteria and broth dyeing directly on fabric. These techniques offer unique possibilities for small-scale dyeing and creative applications. One approach involves isolating bacterial dyes and purifying them to achieve vibrant and diverse colour palettes. By harnessing the natural pigments produced by bacteria, designers and textile artists can explore a wide range of hues and shades that are not commonly found in traditional dye sources. Additionally, bacterial pigments have shown potential for printing applications. The use of bacterial pigments in printing processes allows for intricate designs and patterns to be transferred onto fabrics, adding a unique touch to textile creations. Could you provide an overview of Vienna Textile Lab\u2019s approach to fabricating organic colours from naturally occurring bacteria and how it contributes to sustainability in the textile industry? Nature offers a remarkable source of inspiration and potential solutions for sustainable development. Its vast biodiversity provides us with abundant resources that can be harnessed without causing harm to the environment. By deepening our understanding of the world around us, we can unlock the power of nature to drive positive change. Microorganisms provide some sort of one-pot reactions instead of lengthy chemical value chains. This approach streamlines the manufacturing process, reducing waste and energy consumption. By simplifying the production steps and utilising nature-inspired reactions, we can achieve efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. Furthermore, this approach enables manufacturing to take place wherever it is needed. By embracing decentralised production, we can reduce transportation-related emissions and create local economic opportunities. This shift not only promotes sustainability but also fosters resilience and self-sufficiency within communities. What inspired you to explore the use of bacteria and microorganisms in producing dyes, and what unique advantages do these colours offer compared to conventional synthetic dyes? Textile Lab Amsterdam\u2019s bioshades project, along with my personal interest in dyes and pigments during my school years, greatly influenced my decision to pursue the development of microbial dyes. Witnessing the innovative work being done at Textile Lab Amsterdam and their exploration of sustainable dyeing methods using microorganisms sparked my curiosity and passion for this field. It became clear to me that microbial dyes have the potential to revolutionise the textile industry by offering environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional synthetic dyes. How do you ensure that the dyes produced from bacteria remain organic and environmentally friendly throughout the production process? We adhere to the principles of green chemistry, which means we prioritise processes and materials that are environmentally friendly and avoid those that are toxic or harmful. Our commitment to sustainability extends throughout our entire operation, from the selection of raw materials to the development of innovative manufacturing processes.

The agrifood tech giant is catching the eye of investors after its recent $7 billion valuation. So, when can we expect Impossible Foods stock? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026 Impossible Foods IPO: About the Business Impossible Foods is an agrifood tech startup. The company makes plant-based substitutes for meat, dairy and fish products. The company is on a mission to make the global food system sustainable by eliminating the need to make food from animals. But, it isn\u2019t looking to build a better veggie burger. Instead, Impossible Foods started with a goal to engineer something that meat-eaters will love too. The company has products in over 20,000 grocery stores and 40,000 restaurants around the world. Today, Impossible Foods is the fastest-growing plant-based meat company in retail, according to the company. Impossible Foods is best known for its soy-based Impossible Burger. The company has also released several new products, including plant-based sausage, chicken nuggets, meatballs and ground pork. Its products are currently available in seven different countries. This includes recent expansion into Australia and New Zealand. However, that is only a fraction of what the company is doing to grow. Dr. Patrick O. Brown, M.D., Ph.D., founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, said\u2026 Our mission is to replace the world\u2019s most destructive technology \u2013 the use of animals in food production \u2013 by 2035. To do that, we need to double production every year, on average, for 15 years and double down on research and innovation. The market has its ups and downs, but the global demand for food is always there, and the urgency of our mission only grows. Our investors not only believe in our mission, but they also recognize an extraordinary opportunity to invest in the platform that will transform the global food system. Thanks to its mission to create tasty plant-based meat, this startup has gathered a legion of fans as well as lots of positive press. So, how does it compare to the competition? Plant-Based Food Market Facing Rapid Growth Impossible has tapped into a growing hunger for its better burger. In 2019, UBS estimated that plant-based food sales would rise from $4.6 billion in 2018 to $85 billion by 2030. Furthermore, concerns over climate change could also increase demand for products that emit fewer greenhouse gasses. The meat industry is one of the biggest producers of global greenhouse gas emissions. It has a huge carbon footprint. As the climate crisis worsens, people are seeking out healthier, more eco-friendly alternatives. During the past few years, ESG investments \u2013 environmental, social and governance \u2013 have attracted tens of billions of dollars. Impossible Foods is well-positioned to benefit from these investment trends. Despite this, Impossible Foods has more to compete with than Beyond Meat. In the last couple of years, major names in the meat industry like Tyson, Perdue, Smithfield and Hormel have introduced meat alternatives. Meaning Impossible Foods is competing against some of the largest consumer staples companies in the United States. However, Impossible Foods does have the advantage of already having established partnerships with major fast food restaurants. Burger King launched the Impossible Whopper in August 2019. And it also partnered with Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) to bring customers the Impossible breakfast sandwich. These huge partnerships have brought major brand awareness to Impossible Foods. Impossible Foods was one of the highest-funded agrifood tech startups in 2021. So, let\u2019s take a look at the finances\u2026 Impossible Foods Lands $7 Billion Valuation Ahead of IPO Because Impossible Foods is a private company, so are its finances. However, Impossible Foods\u2019 2021 retail sales were up 85% year-over-year, according to Forbes. Moreover, the company is attracting major investors. Company investors include Coatue Management, Temasek, Horizons Ventures, Mirae Asset and Khosla Ventures. Several celebrities have also pledged support, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, musician Jay-Z, athlete Serena Williams and film director Peter Jackson. Impossible Foods has raised $2.1 billion in total funding, according to CrunchBase. In November 2021, Impossible Foods secured $500 million in a new funding round led by Mirae Asset Global Investments. This funding round landed Impossible Foods a $7 billion valuation. Impossible Foods will use the money to continue its retail expansion in new international markets. In addition, it plans to build out its technology platform, product portfolio and supply chain capabilities. The recent funding round has investors asking: How much will the Impossible Foods IPO raise? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026 Impossible Foods IPO Filing Details In April 2021, sources familiar with the matter reported that the company is planning an Impossible Foods IPO soon. According to the sources, the company will make its public debut through a traditional IPO or SPAC merger. Furthermore, sources said that Impossible Foods has received \u201coffers at a lucrative valuation\u201d \u2013 as much as $10 billion \u2013 from SPAC suitors. However, sources added that the company is mindful that the SPAC route to going public could dilute existing shareholders more than a traditional IPO. Sources warned that market conditions could influence the timing, valuation and size of the Impossible Foods IPO. Considering current market volatility, it\u2019s unknown when investors should prepare for Impossible Foods stock. But it\u2019s expected to come in either late 2022 or sometime in 2023. Impossible Foods\u2019 archrival, Beyond Meat, made its public debut in a $240 million IPO in May 2019. The company held a $1.46 billion valuation at the time. However, Beyond Meat stock is currently trading around half of its IPO price. Which is not a good omen for the Impossible Foods IPO. As always, make sure to research before you invest. IPOs can be volatile for the first few months and share prices are constantly changing. Furthermore, if IPO investing interests you, check out our top recent IPOs and our IPO calendar.

Supported by the Karnataka Institute of Endocrinology and Research, this venture aims to revolutionize foot care by providing tailored solutions for various foot conditions, thereby reducing amputation rates through timely intervention and care. According to Allied Market Research, the global diabetic footwear market was valued at $5.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $14.2 billion by 2031, with a CAGR of 7.9 percent from 2022 to 2031. The rise in the market for therapeutic and custom pedorthic footwear is driven by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, arthritis, and plantar fasciitis, as well as advancements in medical technology. Founded in 2018, FootSecure has focused on making quality podiatric services affordable and accessible. The new custom prescription footwear manufacturing facility in Bangalore marks a significant milestone for the start-up. Dr. Sanjay Sharma, Co-Founder of FootSecure said, \u201cToday, there is little to no awareness about Podiatry as a specialised medical science and there is even lower awareness about therapeutic footwear. There are tens and thousands of Diabetic \/ Medical \/ Ortho Footwear available in the market, which do not necessarily meet the therapeutic standards, and cause more harm than good. For example, a lot of people believe that the softer the soles, the better the footwear. However, that is a myth. What a lot of patients need is an insole, which is hard enough to correct the foot position and the gait and withstand the body weight. Similarly, in the case of a pathological foot, standard off-the-shelf footwear doesn\u2019t work in protecting the feet, giving stability, or preventing any injuries. A unique foot requires bespoke footwear. That is where therapeutic or prescription footwear comes into play.\u201d As a phygital platform, FootSecure offers diagnosis, treatments, and surgeries for over 300 foot and ankle conditions, including chronic wounds and sports injuries. The launch of the prescription footwear facility aligns with FootSecure's mission to integrate specialized foot health solutions. Dr. Sharma expressed excitement about this advancement and gratitude towards the Karnataka Institute of Endocrinology and Research for their support. He highlighted the potential of well-designed prescription footwear to reduce pain, improve healing, and enhance mobility and quality of life for patients. Sanjay Sharma added, \u201cWe are thrilled to launch our prescription footwear manufacturing unit, which represents a significant step forward in our mission to provide tailored foot care solutions. We are also truly grateful for the support of the Karnataka Institute of Endocrinology & Research institute for their trust in our venture. I truly believe that good quality, affordable, and well-designed prescription footwear can not only help reduce pain and improve healing but can also help enhance mobility and drastically improve the quality of life of patients with various foot conditions. Our next step towards making these products truly accessible to all is the launch of our application which will allow clinicians to upload clinical parameters for making custom footwear. Our investment in this initiative reflects our commitment to innovation and excellence in podiatric care.\u201d With an initial investment of Rs 30 Lakhs, the facility offers custom-designed footwear based on the pathology and biomechanics of the foot, ensuring stability, injury prevention, and comfort. The current range includes six models, with options for both men and women, starting from Rs 2000. Advanced customizations cover the outer sole, midsole, insole, and uppers, catering to patients with various foot conditions. The facility has a capacity of up to 300 pairs of custom footwear per day. Patients need to visit FootSecure centers in Bangalore to order custom footwear. However, by September, FootSecure plans to launch an app allowing clinicians nationwide to upload clinical parameters for creating custom footwear. Additionally, FootSecure offers digital solutions like Wound360 and Foot360, which provide guidelines and support for comprehensive foot health and wound care management. Looking ahead, FootSecure aims to expand into new geographies, introduce innovative products and services, and establish India\u2019s first dedicated podiatry hospital by 2025","filter_flag":1}

With festivities around the corner, there has been a significant surge in demand in the markets which are flooded with consumers. Every industry is witnessing the surge, and Beauty and Personal Care is not behind. However, the stiff competition for customers between online and offline brands has become more prominent than ever. To understand the commotion among the brands this season, these brands give us an insight into their 2022 journey and their 2023 growth plans. SUGAR Cosmetics This year SUGAR Cosmetics touched larger milestones, becoming one of the select few brands that have launched 120+ of their own stores in retail, reaching a total of 45000+ retail touchpoints across 550+ cities. SUGAR\u2019s IG page garnered 2.4M+ followers, becoming the largest consumer brand in India on the platform, along with our experiment into gamified AR filters that hit virality on platforms like Instagram and Moj. The brand\u2019s #ShukarHaiSUGARHai Campaign with campaign ambassadors Ranveer Singh and Tamannaah Bhatia was also a huge viral success allowing the brand to receive support from impactful investors namely LCatterton and Ranveer Singh. \u201cAt SUGAR in 2022, we managed to almost double our sales over the previous year, achieved the target of being one of the Top 3 brands in color cosmetics in India, and are looking at another year of massive growth,\u201d said Vineeta Singh, Co-founder, and CEO, SUGAR Cosmetics. She further added, \u201cOur plans for 2023 include targeting and achieving a 100 percent Y-O-Y revenue growth over last year, expansion to more than 60,000 retail outlets, making our D2C platform base stronger and larger, and growing our team size to 3,000 employees.\u201d Keeping its audience in mind, SUGAR is looking forward to tapping into different categories of the beauty industry. The brand will also focus on creating solid content to keep educating and engaging its community across all platforms\u2013digital and others. The Body Shop \"We at The Body Shop are embarking upon a new strategy of \u2018Change Making Beauty\u2019, which means that we aim to empower customers, employees, and partners to drive positive change for the world through our channels, our products, and our activism,\" stated Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, South Asia. With this vision, the brand is aligned to reach its goal of 25 new stores in 2022 at various locations. Currently, having 200 highly visible and accessible stores all over India, including Tier I and II cities, with the latest additions in Itanagar, Surat, and Indore. The brand's current product portfolio is already over 60 percent Vegan, aiming to become 100 percent Vegan by 2023. This aim is the natural next step forward for the brand's Cruelty-Free commitment, including reformulating all our core products from 100 percent Vegetarian to 100 percent Vegan, while focusing on making its product packaging 100 percent recyclable thus reducing its environmental impact. \"We are strengthening our retail and e-commerce channels by opening more workshop stores and launching new digital experiences. We are expanding our retail footprint with a clear focus on smaller cities and towns. Rolling out the new Workshop store format in as many stores as possible: 30+ new ACTIVIST Workshop stores per year, every year till 2025 bringing the brand to people where they love to shop,\" added Chaturvedi. Plum Plum would be closing the financial year at over 2x the revenue of the previous FY, complemented by the 44 percent growth seen in its overall customer base with a 96.54 percent increase in repeat buyers which is a great win in the D2C space. \u201cWe raised $35 million (Rs 270 crore) in a Series C round in March 2022 totaling our funding to over $50 million. With this, our efforts have been towards bringing in more salient brand communication, growing our omnichannel presence and onboarding high-quality talent with a focus on investments in marketing and technology,\u201d said Shankar Prasad, Founder & CEO, Plum Having launched over 8 exclusive brand outlets in the last year across cities, the brand plans to scale this up to 50 in the coming year. Furthermore, Plum onboarded Rashmika Mandanna and Mithila Palkar as its brand ambassadors for the Plum skincare range and Ananya Panday for the Plum Body Lovin\u2019 fragrance range. \u201cWe would be expanding our makeup range aggressively with a host of innovative product formats in the coming year. We would also be launching a line of products in the essentials and advanced ranges under both skincare and haircare categories,\u201d added Prasad. Colorbar The post-pandemic period has witnessed a radical shift in consumer behavior and expectations. As per research, the total retail sale is expected to reach $5.5 trillion by 2027 with online sales making up 30 percent of the market. The retail industry has been largely shadowed by challenges across the supply chain, economic uncertainty, and geo-political factors. I feel that going forward, the only way for retailers to sail through is by exhibiting strong levels of adaptability, agility, and flexibility. \"As we graduate into the next year, we can expect a renewed focus on enhancing the customer shopping journey by providing a seamless experience for hybrid shopping. Re-invention of physical store designs along with a robust omnichannel strategy would, however, emerge as a top priority. Many companies will be seen adding features to support new shopping initiatives while integrating technologies supporting AR\/VR advancements. We are aligned to lead the change and have a strong conviction that our strategy would create benchmarks of excellence in 2023,\u201d stated Samir Kumaar Modi, Founder, and Managing Director, Colorbar Cosmetics. Kapiva \u201cWe have been relentlessly working towards improving the health and wellness quotient of Indians with Ayurveda. Recently, we expanded in the US and UAE to enable this for the global audience as well. Our focus this year was on increasing the effectiveness of our products. We\u2019ve moved the needle on that front by successfully conducting a clinical trial for our Dia Free Juice. It has also proven to be effective in decreasing HbA1c to an extent of 11 percent and increasing insulin production in the body by up to 25-30 percent. However, the highlight of the year was definitely the recognition by Honorable PM Modi,\u201d said Ameve Sharma, Founder, Kapiva. In the upcoming year, Kapiva aims to double down, concurrently increasing brand awareness and recall to become a household name. Modern consumers are less concerned with outward appearance than they once were, and are more concerned with their complete well-being, which encompasses physical, mental, and emotional health. In order to capitalize on this trend, Kapiva is constantly creating consumer awareness by keeping the emphasis on the paramount importance of Ayurveda and how it can enable people to live a holistic lifestyle. Earth Rhythm 2022 was a favorable year for Earth Rhythm, as it brought in a lot of positive changes in terms of organization, growth, and product. At an organizational level, the brand was able to double the size of the team with its customer base growing 4x times compared to the previous financial year. The brand also went offline with the launch of its exclusive kiosks at 12 different locations across India. \u201cWe are expanding our makeup category which will go on to strengthen Earth Rhythm\u2019s wide-ranging portfolio, we have also been intensifying the existing categories. True to our digital-first identity, it was also a natural step for us to continue investing in technology in a bid to further streamline operations and give our customers every convenience they desire. We successfully launched our very own mobile App for both Android and iOS platforms this year and have been gaining steady traction on it. Next year, we plan to further build our portfolio by deepening the makeup category launched in 2022. We reckon 2x growth over FY 2021-22,\u201d said Harini Sivakumar, Founder, and CEO, Earth Rhythm. In keeping with this shift in the consumer\u2019s preference, the brand aims to reinforce its multifunctional product range in both makeup and personal care (face, body, hair), aimed at eliminating the need for and use of multiple products in everyday makeup and skincare routines. ARATA This year at Arata launched over 20 products and 30 offline stores across India, steadily growing 10 percent month on month with respect to GMV. \u201cIn the upcoming year, we will go full throttle to bridge the gaps in our product line and be a one-stop shop for all hair care needs. We have already begun our groundwork and have set processes to create formulas in the anti-hair fall, hair colorants, and hair styling segments,\u201d said Dhruv Madhok, Co-Founder, ARATA. BlushBee 2022 has been the year of the first full-fledged operations for Blushbee. Beginning with just three products and later expanding to 10 categories with 64 unique SKUs, the brand has witnessed massive organic growth in its customer base. BlushBee as a cosmetics line is a product of careful decisions in choosing what it wants, the other advantage is that being a clean and green beauty brand which is an important factor in the value proposition. \u201cWe hope to grow into a one-stop shop for all things related to color cosmetics, so we are actively looking into introducing new products like foundations, gloss, and so on. We have also discussed extending our horizons beyond just the realm of color cosmetics very soon,\u201d stated Shobana and Navneethan, Founders, BlushBee Organic Beauty Brand. Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co The brand was launched in 2022 with the mindset of embracing the true self and exploring the crazy side. The brand is PETA and IFRA certified, FDA approved, and currently provides the best possible sensorial experience in Hair Care with India's First Date Seed Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Hair Oil. \u201cIn the short term, we are working towards expanding on two fronts- launching more affordable luxury products across categories in which we operate. With the right set of team, products, and marketing strategy we were able to launch our brand, and today, 6 months post the launch we are happy to serve more than 2000+ households,\u201d commented Damanjit Kohli and Karishma Sahni, Founders, Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co. Increasing its touchpoint and interaction with the product, currently, Crazy Owl has signed up on all major marketplace platforms \u2013 Amazon Launchpad, Flipkart Propel Program, Purple, Snapdeal, Tata 1 mg, First cry, Myntra, Nykaa, Bigbasket and will be launching itself on Blink it, Paytm, Pharmeasy and Shopperstop planning to grow its channel every month.
