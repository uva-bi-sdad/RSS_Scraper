Ecolab Rapid Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner has both hard and soft surface claims. More Solutions for I&I Issues Lysol Pro & BlueDot Forecast Concurrent Rise in Flu, RSV & Covid-19 Predictive analysis conducted for Reckitt\u2019s Lysol Pro Solutions by data experts at BlueDot Inc. suggests that US businesses should anticipate a concurrent rise in flu, RSV, and covid-19 this year, but that the onset of respiratory virus season will be closer to typical pre- pandemic timing than last year. \u201cWith flu and RSV expected to hit the US at a similar time, businesses should deploy effective germ reduction strategies to help address the spread through both surfaces and air,\u201d said Dr. Julie McKinney, director of R&D at Reckitt\u2019s Lysol Pro Solutions. \u201cThe season has historically shaved off productivity from businesses due to worker and school absenteeism. Early indicators suggest that this year is likely to mirror pre-pandemic trends compared to last year, which was highly unpredictable.\u201d According to McKinney, holistic hand and surface hygiene, including the use of EPA-approved products such as Lysol Disinfectant Spray or Lysol Disinfecting Wipes, as well as a focus on \u201ceffective cleaning measures on germ-harboring hot spots can help reduce the spread of germs, and support a more productive workforce.\u201d Last year, the flu season began, on average, seven weeks earlier than pre-pandemic trends. This year, signs from the southern hemisphere suggest that the flu season is trending toward pre-pandemic patterns, according to Lysol. Formulation Science Save The Date: HCPA\u2019s 2024 New Horizons Is October 1-3 in Asheville, NC The Household and Commercial Products Association (HCPA) New Horizons conference will be held Oct. 1-3, 2024 at the Grand Bohemian Hotel Asheville in Asheville, NC. Hosted every three years by HCPA\u2019s Cleaning Products Division, experts from industry and academia come together to engage in workshops that explore the future of product formulation. HCPA\u2019s Annual Meeting is this month (Dec 3-6) in Fort Lauderdale. The keynote speaker is quarterback Joe Theismann. www.thehcpa.org Cleaning, Curated The I&I cleaning category has a long history in innovative technologies that keep surfaces sparkling, stop the spread of germs and keep bacteria at bay\u2014and there\u2019s a place that pays homage to it all: the Museum of Clean. Attendees at the ISSA Show were able to get a taste of what\u2019s inside the 74,000 sq.ft. facility in Pocatello, ID through a display on the show floor in Las Vegas last month. The museum was opened in 2011 by Don Aslett, an industry icon with his own storied history in the cleaning industry. Whirlpool\u2019s In-School Laundry Program Helps Combat Chronic Absenteeism Whirlpool is embarking on its eighth\u2014and biggest\u2014year of the Care Counts Laundry Program, which provides access to washers and dryers in schools primarily located in underserved communities. The idea is to help remove a small but important barrier to attendance: access to clean clothes. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the program has expanded to 154 schools across 40 states, including new schools in Connecticut, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Whirlpool began installing washers and dryers in schools in 2015. The program now provides an estimated 50,000 students with clean clothes. Based on findings from the 2022-2023 academic year, nearly 80% of participating high-risk elementary school students where the program is active saw an increase in student attendance. By 2028, Whirlpool expects to expand the Care Counts Laundry Program to all 50 states. \u201cYou are doing something that really truly matters in the world,\u201d ISSA Executive Director John Barrett told an audience assembled last month for \u201cThen, Now, Forever: Celebrating 100 Years of ISSA\u201d\u2014a special event held just before the doors opened on the 2023 ISSA Show North America Las Vegas. ISSA \u2014the worldwide cleaning industry association\u2014has come a long way since 1923, when its predecessor, the National Sanitary Supply Association, was formed with seven founding members. A century ago, just a handful of manufacturers were part of the membership of the fledging organization.Today, ISSA has about 1,000 manufacturer members, whom Barrett called the \u201cheart and soul of this convention.\u201dThey fuel the industry as well.Inside the ISSA North America show, which this year was held at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, were manufacturers of disinfectants dish detergents and air care products , as well as makers of tools and devices to dispense, wash, scrub and dispose. All told, ISSA has more than 10,500 members spanning distributors, manufacturers and manufacturer reps, building service contractors (BSCs), in-house service providers, residential cleaners and associated services.It is an ecosystem that insures consumers\u2019 most favorite and important spaces are clean. And that, in turn, protects the health and wellness of everyone\u2014whether a football stadium filled with Swifties, a local school packed with students and teachers, or a corporate office seeing a steady stream of workers back at their desks and inside conference rooms.Leading cleaning solution manufacturers not only formulate in the lab\u2014they\u2019re tracking flu season, collaborating with microbiologists, digging into societal needs to deliver improved hygiene for more people and sourcing more sustainable solutions. And if that\u2019s not enough, they provide training programs to help their busy customers who remain under great pressure from labor shortages.The pressure cooker atmosphere of the pandemic has subsided, but cleaning professionals are still under the gun. Many are burned out, according to recent polling from CloroxPro . In the CloroxPro\u2019s 2023 Clean Index report\u2014which reflects the current challenges and perceptions of more than 1,700 cleaning professional\u2014nearly nine out of ten (87%) cleaning professionals personally experienced burnout in the past two years.This troubling stat comes as consumer confidence in the cleanliness of public spaces increased 23% during the past year. According to Clorox, 59% consumers are confident in the professional cleaning industry\u2019s ability to aid in preventing the spread of illness-causing germs, up from 48% in 2022. That confidence stems from important visual and sensory cues that make consumers feel safe\u2014think a clean, pleasant smell, seeing janitors and staff cleaning, shiny floors or bright and clean walls\/surfaces and public availability of disinfectant wipes.Despite this, Clorox Pro data revealed cleaning professionals feel less confident year-over-year in their ability to prevent the spread of illness-causing germs. In fact, cleaning professionals\u2019 confidence fell nearly 5% compared to last year, with the largest confidence drop among building-service contractors ( down 15% vs. 2022). The primary drivers of declining confidence were cited as a lack of training programs (22%, up 9% vs. 2022) and more public scrutiny of cleaning practices (20%, up 6% vs. 2022).According to CloroxPro, the data reinforces how much responsibility is placed on cleaning professionals and the need to ensure they have the tools and support to create clean and healthy public spaces.For CloroxPro, that can mean delivering ready-to-use (RTU) cleaning and disinfecting products like Clorox EcoClean, which includes EcoClean Disinfecting Cleaner, which is made with a plant-based active ingredient that kills 99.9% of illness-causing germs in two minutes or less when used as directed. This product garnered The Clorox Company an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2023 Green Chemistry Award in the \u201cDesigning Greener Chemicals\u201d category. The EcoClean product range also includes all-purpose cleaner and glass cleaner.According to CloroxPro, 82% of cleaning professional cite killing germs as the most important quality for eco-friendly cleaners. Jordan Bastian, senior infection preventionist at The Clorox Company, says EcoClean offers facilities managers and professional cleaning staff numerous benefits\u2014from efficacy and versatility to reduced effort and time saved.Similar sentiments were echoed across the show floor at ISSA last month. Collectively, the I&I cleaning space is constantly pushing its resources toward solving key pain points for cleaning professionals.Take Ecolab\u2019s entry in the 2023 ISSA Innovation Award competition: Ecolab Rapid Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner. With both hard and soft surface claims, this \u201c4-in-1\u201d solution is versatile; it can be a hospital disinfectant, a streak-free glass cleaner in the office, a bactericide for high-touch counters, and even sprayed on upholstered chairs in the hotel lobby, according to officials. What\u2019s more, it can be applied with spray bottles, mop, microfiber pad, bucket, auto scrubber and electrostatic sprayer.\u201cCleaning staff deserve a solution that works in the way they do today,\u201d said Amanda Bakken, an Ecolab chemist who presented the Rapid Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner on the ISSA show floor. \u201cIt is a disinfectant that goes where you go.\u201dImproved efficiency in cleaning is increasingly being driven by technology, too. While consumers are familiar with touch-free units that provide squirts of soap or roll out a paper towel on demand, IoT and connected dispensers provide tangible benefits for cleaning service professionals and facilities managers.\u201cThey are contending with labor shortages and they are interested in having smart dispensers that help their skeleton staff be more efficient by sending a ping or notification to janitor\/manager\u2019s iPhone or tablet. This way, they can spend less time checking dispensers that are full or half-full and focus on the ones that are empty,\u201d said Laura Mahecha, director of industrial and institutional cleaning practice at Kline & Company. Tork Vision Cleaning uses real-time data from connected dispensers and people counters to help facility managers and cleaning staff know when and where cleaning and dispenser refilling are needed. According to Tork, this relates to a 91% reduction in dispenser checks. And as sensors track movement, a cleaning manager knows when a conference room sits unused, and therefore doesn\u2019t require immediate attention.According to Kline\u2019s Industrial & Institutional Hand Care report , 34.3% of respondents in a survey conducted this summer said they used smart (IoT) dispensers at their facility or customer\u2019s facility, and 40.4% said they did not, but planned to install them. The remainder said they did not and did not plan to install. The survey encompassed 508 respondents across building service contractors, healthcare, foodservice, education, retailers, industry, lodging and sport\/fitness.Newer dispensers are also more sustainable.As of October, 11 existing Tork brand dispensers in the US (and 15 in Canada) are carbon neutral. Tork says it is one of the first in its class in North America to have reduced and offset carbon for the entire lifecycle of selected soap, toilet paper and hand towel dispensers. Carbon emissions have already been reduced by using purchased renewable electricity in the production, and the remaining carbon emissions are offset with verified credits from climate projects, according to the brand, which is part of Essity. SC Johnson Professional\u2019s Proline Wave Dispenser is a one-liter dispenser made with 70% Recovered Coastal Plastic (plastic that is collected on land within 31 miles of an ocean, in countries with high volumes of uncollected plastic waste). The dispenser\u2019s recovered plastic materials are sourced through SCJ\u2019s partnership with Plastic Bank. Each dispenser uses the equivalent of 16 16.9 fl.oz. recovered coastal plastic waste plastic bottles.Proline Wave is compatible with SC Johnson Professional\u2019s full line of Refresh Foam soaps, which use 30% less product and can reduce average water consumption as much as 45% when washing and rinsing hands compared to traditional lotion soap, said the company. Independent tests show that washing hands with foam soap rather than lotion soap can reduce average water consumption by as much as 45% when using a modified hand wash approach of dispensing soap on dry hands and turning the tap on only when rinsing off.Foaming soap is at the heart of Soap2o Ltd, a company that exhibited at the ISSA Show for the first time to tout its Super Hydro Pod. According to officials, its point of differentiation is its increased sustainability profile and ease of use. One pod creates one gallon of foaming soap when dropped into a gallon container with water and agitated by hand for about a minute. The company plans to expand beyond hand soap, offering shampoos and other personal care products in 2024.More sustainable solutions are being sought by endusers of I&I products, including the hospitality sector, which is pursuing green practices due to both new regulations and customer expectations.\u201cWe are starting to see increased usage of amenities dispenser in hotel rooms across the country,\u201d said Mahecha of Kline.According to Kline\u2019s Janitorial and Housekeeping Cleaning Products USA study, more than 20 states have laws banning single use plastics (SUPs), but the initiative has taken hold on a more widespread nature due to the cost savings afforded hotel operators by using bulk products in dispensers rather than small bottles.Across the ISSA show floor in Las Vegas, there were solutions for all types of I&I settings.In addition to offering a sneak peek of its new laundry lineup due out next spring (Tide Professional commercial laundry detergent in pods, liquid and powder and Downy Professional commercial fabric softener), P&G Professional showcased new Dawn Professional Heavy Duty Manual Pot and Pan detergent. The proprietary formula, made with Dawn Professional\u2019s highest level of proprietary grease-cutting surfactant, contains three times more baked-on grease cleaning power to help dishwashers spend less time and energy on greasy cookware and can reduce scrubbing by 50% from active ingredients that do more of the work.\u201cWith the time and effort they spend on cleaning greasy pots and pans and other kitchen tools, back-of-house kitchen staff have some of the hardest jobs in a restaurant but rarely are celebrated by customers. Restaurant owners want a detergent that saves time and makes the lives of their dishwashers easier,\u201d said Paul Edmondson, vice president of P&G North America, in a statement.Like dirty pots and pans, ants are another thing customers don\u2019t want to see when dining out.To that end, Henkel this year showcased its Combat brand, which provides roach and ant killing solutions for professional kitchens as well as commercial and manufacturing settings, offices and more. The newest product in the range is Combat 2-in-1 Ant Bait, billed as the first 2-in-1 in the US market, according to James Lothrop, a Combat brand manager.Ants, according to Henkel officials Happi spoke with at ISSA, are historically picky eaters, but Combat\u2019s 2-in-1 solution is designed to kill 11 kinds of ants by way of two baits: one grease-based, the other sugar-based (officials at the show likened it to a \u201cbuffet\u201d). Ants take the bait back to the colony, eliminating insects at the source.O3 Technologies Inc., Los Angeles, showcased its OxiTerminator Mattress Sanitizer, a system that allows hotel workers to clean and disinfect mattresses in less than 30 minutes. It would offer an alternative to the cumbersome process of removing a mattress from a room and taking it to a disinfection truck, according to Andy Rifkin, founder and chief technology officer.According to Rifkin, O3\u2019s work centers on the use of activated oxygen, or O3 (hence, its name). First, the mattresses are placed into a sealed, leakproof bag. Then, activated oxygen is pumped in, \u201cpulled through\u201d the layers of material at \u201csafe, therapeutic levels,\u201d and subjected to UVC light and a series of catalysts. The process is said to kill covid and other disease-causing pathogens, as well as mold, parasites, bed bugs, fleas and mites.The mattresses need to be vacuumed after the process, according to the company.O3 Technologies also developed a commercial sonic mop adapter that can be attached to existing commercial mops as well as Swiffer-style tools. The OxiTerminator Mattress Sanitizer is set to launch at the end of Q1 2024 with the mop adapter following in Q2 2024.NPD continues around use of natural components in disinfectant technologies. According to Kline, 38% of end users view green cleaning products to be as effective as traditional cleaning chemicals. Demand is increasing for products with active ingredients that are plant-based or botanical, such as lavender, citric acid and thymol, notes Kline.Last month, Diversey signed a multi-year licensing accord with Virox Technologies to bring its patented disinfectant technology known as Citr-IQ, to the healthcare sector and other segments. Diversey will add multiple disinfectant products, powered by Virox\u2019s Citr-IQ, to its lineup of professional offerings.Citr-IQ is a synergistic blend that effectively kills pathogens by harnessing the natural disinfectant power of citric acid. Citr-IQ maintains the balance of efficacy and safety that Virox antimicrobial technologies are known for while advancing performance in sustainability and material compatibility, according to Diversey. Citr-IQ\u2019s synergistic chemistry is said to be powerful enough to eliminate pathogens of concern, including SARS-CoV2, ESBLs, norovirus and Candida auris. Additionally, it is the first citric-acid-based tuberculocidal disinfectant with a one-minute contact time and the first one-minute tuberculocidal disinfectant compatible with fully biodegradable wipes. It is safe for multiple surfaces and devices, including plastics and soft metals.Under the terms of the agreement, Virox will receive undisclosed license fees and royalties for the use of the formulas covered under the Citr-IQ platform. It will manufacture products containing the Citr-IQ formulas for Diversey\u2019s North American markets.This new accord lengthens a 24-year-long partnership; Diversey had previously licensed accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) chemical disinfectant technology from Virox, which Diversey fully acquired in 2019. AHP is the active ingredient in multiple brands, including Diversey\u2019s Oxivir and Accel infection prevention platforms.Indie brands are also developing safer solutions for I&I cleaning. Dear Planet Labs, Placentia, CA exhibited at ISSA for the first time. Its Everyday Disinfectant Spray contains just three ingredients: hypochlorous acid (HOCI), water and salt. The limited-ingredient spray eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, including covid-19, in 60 seconds. It is EPA List-N and List-Q approved and offers an alternative to traditional disinfectant sprays formulated with quats, said officials.Safer, smarter and more sustainable solutions are the future of I&I cleaning.","filter_flag":1}

The competition, held twice a year in conjunction with the ISPO trade show, recognizes the most innovative performance textiles, components, and apparel. Designed to be compatible with garment recycling systems, the DynaPel zipper uses GTT\u2019s EMPEL\u00ae technology instead of the standard PU film to achieve its water repellency. The lack of a PU film helps remove one of the barriers of textile-to-textile recycling of performance apparel by eliminating the urethane material, which presents challenges to garment recycling processes.1 \u201cReceiving an ISPO Textrends Award helps validate the technology and our efforts to develop fasteners for circular systems,\u201d said Terry Tsukumo, vice president, Product Strategy Division, Global Sales Headquarters, YKK Corp. \u201cBy employing EMPEL\u00ae technology, we can achieve the robust water protection expected from YKK\u00ae products while eliminating the challenges that PU poses to recycling systems.\u201d Conventional chemical and mechanical garment recycling systems cannot process the polyurethane film commonly used on water-repellent zippers, necessitating the removal of zippers from garments before recycling. This additional processing step often deters recyclers from accepting garments with PU zippers, resulting in unnecessary waste. EMPEL technology uses advanced green chemistry devoid of PFAS and a specialized manufacturing process that allows the chemistry to penetrate the yarn and encapsulate it with a water-repellent layer through molecular cross-linking.

Verigrow Pot uses a novel biodegradable material that acts as food as it decomposes, helping plants get the nutrients they need as they are placed in the ground. Verigrow Supplement complements the Company\u2019s existing range of liquid fertilizer and soil improver products by acting as an all-purpose product containing a balanced blend of macro (except phosphorus), micronutrients, and trace elements. Veratin created the Verigrow liquid fertilizer and soil improver range through the green chemistry process by extracting amino acids from upcycled waste wool, making it the first of its kind. Verigrow is also one of the greenest organic fertilizers in the market, as the amino acids present reduce the need for high levels of phosphorus and potassium by some 25%-30%, and it uses fewer units of nitrogen than other organic fertilizers, reducing the environmental footprint of the product. Veratin\u2019s Founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Ramiz Boulos, said that amino acids are part of the building blocks of life. \u201cAmino acids are molecules used to make proteins for living beings, your body needs them to function, and they are usually obtained through consumption of food in humans. In plants, they are manufactured in an energy-intensive process utilizing the nutrients available in the soil, carbon and oxygen from the air, and hydrogen from the water as the base. Supplementing plants with amino acids saves them energy, which they can use for other purposes, which is why the development of the Verigrow biodegradable pot and supplements are so important. \u201cThese products are the first of their kind to be made of amino acids extracted from upcycled waste wool, and the use of amino acids to act as sources of growth reduces the need for high levels of fertilizers, reducing environmental damage. Verigrow Pot also helps the environment by reducing the need for plastic, which aligns with our environmentally conscious customers. \u201cVeratin is ideally placed to meet the growing market and regulatory demand for sustainable products that naturally fit into the circular economy, as its products use upcycled materials, support biodiversity, and reduce the need for harmful plastics.

So, why not launch a makeup line? \u201cI had been talking about doing a line of makeup for a long time,\u201d Big Freedia tells ESSENCE. The New Orleans bounce artist partnered with beauty brand Black Opal on her first, limited edition makeup collection: Bold Beats. \u201cWhen they reached out to me, I was very familiar with the brand,\u201d she says. Founded by Carol Jackson-Mouyiaris in 1994, \u201cBlack Opal is the biggest Black-centric make-up line that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d As for the inspiration?

(Graphic: Business Wire) Lubrizol launched new products and extensions in 2023 aimed to help solve customer challenges as part of its purpose to leverage science to advance mobility, improve wellbeing and enhance modern life. (Graphic: Business Wire) CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--For 95 years, Lubrizol has been synonymous with breakthrough scientific innovation, and 2023 was no exception. The company launched new products and extensions in 2023 aimed to help solve customer challenges as part of its purpose to leverage science to advance mobility, improve wellbeing and enhance modern life. \u201cLubrizol has a relentless drive for innovation \u2013 both in the decisions we make today and the solutions we create for tomorrow,\u201d said Lubrizol Chief Technology Officer Julie Edgar. \u201cAs a core pillar of our organization, innovation propels our purpose and creates opportunities for our customers and those they serve, and we\u2019re proud of the new innovations and extensions introduced as part of our portfolio this year, several of which were recognized through leading award programs.\u201d Among the company\u2019s 2023 innovations and extensions: Eco-friendly lubricant additives Growing demand for lubricants with improved environmental properties has been driven by increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Lubrizol\u2019s EcoAssurant\u2122 portfolio meets that need through environmentally acceptable finished fluids, additive packages and components. The product family is designed to help industrial fluid and lubricant manufacturers accelerate the speed to bring environmentally acceptable lubricant (EAL) offerings to the market with confidence. Enabling sustainable beauty products Increasingly eco-conscious consumers and a rigorous regulatory environment are driving a shift to silicone-free beauty products. Lubrizol\u2019s SilSense\u2122 Bio 5 emollient is a sustainable silicone alternative, bringing unique sensory experience and proven performance to skin, hair, sun care and makeup applications. This innovation was recognized by the industry with the Makeup Bar Silver award at in-cosmetics\u00ae Global and Innovation Awards. A preventive approach to aging More than ever, younger consumers are looking for a science-based skin care that offers preventative solutions to slow the signs of aging. Argireline\u00ae YOUth peptide is an oil-soluble version of the well-known Argireline\u00ae peptide, thanks to the proprietary LipoClear\u2122 inverse micelle delivery system. The active ingredient shows efficacy against the areas of greatest concern among young generations, helping to prevent the emergence of future expression wrinkles. Advancing new beauty aesthetic trends Today\u2019s consumers are drawn to a new \u201cphygital\" beauty aesthetic that blends the physical and digital worlds, emphasizing facial sculpting by reshaping the face, raising the cheekbones and bringing increased attention to the eyes. Lubrizol\u2019s sustainable Uplevity\u2122 e-Lift peptide helps achieve this effect by mimicking the benefits of microcurrent devices on the skin for an upper face lifted appearance and reduced visibility of wrinkles.

The ingredient has firmness and sensory properties and reduces the amount of thickener or wax needed in the end formulation for anhydrous formulas. It\u2019s been specially developed with an occlusive agent to help stabilise cosmetic formulas, making it a perfect plant-based alternative to lanolin or other animal-based emollients. Upcycled skin care active\u200b Expanscience has transformed one of its flagship active ingredients to improve skin elasticity and reshape facial contours into an organic version, CO2LLAGENEER\u00ae Bio. The active ingredient is obtained by a supercritical CO2 extraction process. It\u2019s an upcycled by-product of the agri-food industry and organic-certified at 95.4% by Ecocert Greenlife, according to the COSMOS standard. The ingredient is based on a concentration of lup\u00e9ol, extracted from the seeds of French sweet white lupine, from the West of France. This is then combined with organic oleic sunflower oil. In-vitro tests demonstrates that the active ingredient stimulates collagen synthesis to improve skin elasticity, and reshapes and firms areas prone to sagging. It also stimulates the production of quality collagen by activating the chaperone protein HSP47 (Heat Shock Protein), contributing to its optimal organisation and structure. Circular ingredient with malodour counteracting effects The \u2018circular chemistry\u2019 ingredient holds promising malodour counteracting properties, according to Barcelona-based Eurofragance. The new ingredient is based upon a previous launch L\u2019\u00c2me du Bois \u2013 a proprietary upcycled ingredient made from discarded sawdust of western red cedarwood. It\u2019s created from the natural crystallisation process to precipitate and extract methyl thujate present in the wood\u2019s essential oil as crystals. Verdenix\u2122 was then obtained by similarly treating the residues from producing the first ingredient. Eurofragance\u2019s R&D team worked with perfumers to incorporate it into existing or new fragrance compositions and it gives the typical olfactive notes of cedarwood, which makes it relatively easy to integrate into perfume formulas as a bottom note. The ingredient also works to eliminate and harmonise malodours. It was tested on a variety of smells, such as tobacco, and it reduced malodour perception up to 80%, which is equivalent or even above other similar chemicals, such as citral or ethylene brassylate. Multi-purpose active based on alfalfa \u200b The multifunctional natural active is enriched in alfalfa galactomannans, which enhances the beauty of all skin types, and its efficacy has been demonstrated on various panels. To develop the active ingredient enriched in galactomannans, SILAB used the seeds of the alfalfa plant from certified organic farms selected in France with a secure, traceable supply. It then combined its expertise in tissue engineering and transcriptomics to explore the transversal activity spectrum of the ingredient on the biological pathways essential for epidermal and dermal functions. A large-scale exploratory study has been established that the ingredient stimulates epidermal functionalities by modulating the biological pathways related to the physical and water barrier, the immune barrier, and the anchoring of the epidermis to the dermis; and reinforces the dermal matrix quality by boosting the synthesis of collagen I and reducing the synthesis of MMP-1. Upcycled citrus byproduct CP Kelco\u2019s KELCOSENSTM Citrus Fiber has been certified as an upcycled ingredient by the Upcycled Food Association. The ingredient is upcycled from spent citrus peels, a byproduct of the juice industry near the company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Brazil. With a circular approach, leftover materials from the citrus fibre production process are repurposed and nutrients in the process water are used to fertilise local crops, such as sugar cane. The personal care ingredient can be used in a range of products, from silky serums to luxe creams, to help formulators stabilise emulsifier-free formulations and deliver different textures. Cold-pressed black seed oil \u200b B\u2019utyQuin\u2122 TriNutra\u2019s cold-pressed black seed oil (BSO) standardised to 3% thymoquinone, the key phytonutrient, with low free fatty acids (<2%) to maintain its purity, quality, stability and bioavailability. It has been shown in vitro\u200b and clinically to possess antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial functionality improvement properties to improve and protect skin and scalp health. One published in-vitro study\u200b demonstrated B\u2019utyQuin\u2019s ability to both support the maintenance of a healthy skin and gut microbiome via anti-bacterial and antifungal activity against pathogens. The study investigated four black seed oil products from different origins with varying levels of thymoquinone and free fatty acid content. Of the four products, B\u2019utyQuin was superior in its ability to inhibit the overgrowth of Malassezia furfur\u200b, Candida albicans\u200b and Staphylococcus aureus\u200b.","filter_flag":1}
