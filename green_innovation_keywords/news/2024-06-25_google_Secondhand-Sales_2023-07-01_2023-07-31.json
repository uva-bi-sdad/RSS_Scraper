Read part one on the enduring appeal of Japan's luxury market; part two on South Korea\u2019s next big fashion import; part three on why fast fashion is flooding Japan; part four on the fashion opportunity for Asia\u2019s largest metaverse platform; and part five on what comes after K-beauty. The secondhand market for luxury goods is heating up in Asia after years of existing in the shadow of the primary market. While resale platforms like The RealReal, Thredup and Depop have gained traction in the West, adoption in Asia has been slower, hampered by concerns about counterfeiting, an ongoing perception of social status being attached to new goods, as well as superstitions around wearing other people\u2019s clothes.","filter_flag":1}
