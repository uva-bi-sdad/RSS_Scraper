(Port City Daily\/Amy Passaretti Willis) NEW HANOVER COUNTY \u2014 A pilot project is underway at a jointly owned public park, with the hopes of phasing out toxic herbicides and pesticides. New Hanover County Soil and Water Conservation District supervisor Evan Folds launched a petition urging the city and county to reconsider its land-use care practices. Currently, they both use a variety of chemicals, including glyphosate, a controversial ingredient in Roundup; the federal government is still undergoing research to determine its level of toxicity. But Folds wants to see a policy that explains how and why staff use the chemicals they do. Deciphering information from purchase receipts via a public records request, Folds found 13 herbicides and pesticides the city uses routinely and more than 50 from the county. Almost all are revealed to be harmful to aquatic life, birds and bees; some go so far as being possibly carcinogenic by the EPA, such as bifenthrin and Chlorothalonil. A few don\u2019t have enough health data available to know the true risks of exposure. Folds called the list \u201cthe worst of the worst,\u201d and noted using man-made materials in natural systems leads to weakened ecosystems. This creates a cycle of having to use more chemicals to create a healthy landscape, he added. \u201cWe minimize the use of fungicides and insecticides and continue to research and explore possible \u2018green\u2019 products \u2014 but it\u2019s important that they provide satisfactory results that are needed,\u201d New Hanover County Parks and Recreation Director Tara Duckworth said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t just one solution to the challenge of pesticides and insecticides and the needs of our parks, but we will continue to work with others \u2014 like our turf specialist with NC State \u2014 to assist us in ensuring we have expert knowledge in our processes.\u201d Folds started an awareness campaign in February that has 165 signatures of support to build landscaping budgets around healthier practices. \u201cThe hope of the moment is to show brass tax, it\u2019s not more expensive to do the right thing,\u201d Folds told Port City Daily on a call Tuesday. In 2020, Folds sought a grant from Stonyfield Organics, which was accepted and approved by the city for $10,000 in May 2021. It helped implement an organic land management pilot project at Olsen Park, a 60-acre space owned by both the City of Wilmington and New Hanover County. Effectively, the goal is to use compost and avoid chemicals to grow the soil on two of Olsen Park\u2019s five ballfields. City staff, along with consultants Beyond Pesticides and Osbourn Organics, will then compare results: the soil health on two softball fields for effectiveness of a synthetic-free program versus three fields that received the \u201ctraditional\u201d method of landscape care. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to replace pesticides [with green alternatives] but mitigating the need for them over time,\u201d Folds explained. Crews first gathered a baseline on the property being tested, with pictures and soil tests in 2022. The report was delivered to city staff in August 2022 and showed municipal fields are low in organic matter, according to city community services assistant director Sally Thigpen. The use of only organic methods on the two ballfields officially began in April 2023. \u201cAnecdotally, staff are seeing similar turf performance as the other fields at this time,\u201d Thigpen said. She also relayed the city\u2019s consultants estimate it could take up to three years to build the organic matter in the soil and reap the benefits. The success rate cannot be visually perceived, Folds said; knowing if the program is working can only be derived from the health of soil \u2014 meaning more organic matter \u2014 not being exposed to toxic pesticides and herbicides. \u201cWe turn the herbicide pump off and weeds start growing in the ballfield, we think \u2018it\u2019s not working,\u2019\u201d Folds said. \u201cBut it\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d Part of the vision is phasing out pesticides and herbicides, such as 2,4-D, widely used and leads to severe eye irritation. It can also cause nervous system damage, coughing, dizziness, nausea, and blood, liver and kidney toxicity, according to the EPA. Dogs are more susceptible to side effects when exposed, including vomiting, lethargy, convulsions and diarrhea. The main aim for Folds is to establish a protocol for land care in the city and county. \u201cIt\u2019s not about banning things,\u201d he added. Except for maybe glyphosate \u2014 a common ingredient in Roundup \u2014 used by both the city and county. According to reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the substance can now be found in 80% of urine samples of people nationwide. In 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported there were no health risks linked to glyphosate when used according to its label. Two years later, a federal court ordered the agency to reevaluate its findings. A judge determined the EPA did not have adequate research to back up its determination that glyphosate was not toxic and not a carcinogen. Research is still ongoing at this time. However, in 2015, the World Health Organization listed it as \u201ca probable human carcinogen.\u201d Glyphosate is particularly dangerous because it\u2019s water soluble, meaning trace residues could occur in food products. Though the chemical is not often applied directly to crops being grown for human consumption. The city treats broadleaf weeds \u2014 such as poison ivy, invasive English ivy competing with native vegetation and nutsedge in ornamental landscapes \u2014 impacting infrastructure and public use areas, such as sidewalks and parks. \u201cTargeted spot treatment is typical,\u201d Thigpen said. \u201c[Staff] are required to follow the product label for timing and rates.\u201d According to Folds\u2019 research, the city spent $7,652 on pesticides and herbicides from July 2019 to December 2020, with $644 of that on 16 gallons of glyphosate. In fiscal year 2022, the county budgeted $40,000 for chemicals and pesticides for the 2,900 acres of public space it manages. It uses glyphosate on landscape beds and sidewalk cracks but not on athletic turf fields. \u201cThe takeaway on cost is that once you sync on the reality of the chemicals being used and their connection to chronic disease, we don\u2019t really spend enough on pesticides to be worried about the cost,\u201d Folds said. As a separate initiative, he is partnering with Thigpen to find safe alternatives to glyphosate. \u201cMy aim is to ensure our decision makers are knowledgeable enough on the subject to make sure our priorities are in the right place,\u201d Folds said. \u201cHow much is spraying poison on playgrounds worth?\u201d He also said Thigpen was facing pushback about the price of switching from glyphosate. \u201cShe is facing the reality that the glyphosate replacement is \u2018twice as much,\u2019 and she has no budget to work with, and more critically, not enough staff to do things differently,\u201d Folds said. Contact Organics, Folds\u2019 recommended alternative, costs $175 per gallon versus a $40 2.5-gallon jug of Ranger Pro, containing glyphosate. Thigpen said, in general, the city follows Integrated Pest Management practices \u2014 supported by the EPA and USDA \u2014 and employs qualified, licensed applicators. They use \u201cmany tools\u201d to tackle pests and weed pressures in public spaces, she said. \u201cHerbicides are just one tool, and our team uses a whole host of cultural and mechanical practices, like mulching, mowing, hand weeding and planting native plants that are less susceptible to pests,\u201d Thigpen explained. \u201cThe city does periodically test new products that could reduce impacts to the environment, the public and staff.\u201d The county, co-owner of Olsen Park, is also actively following the outcomes of the pilot plan. Duckworth said the county will continue to work to \u201cfind a balance\u201d between what is needed on public spaces \u2014 such as field recovery from high-demand usage, mitigating fire ants, and controlling invasive weeds \u2014 and the impact to the end user. A lifelong entrepreneur in natural approaches to lawn care and self-proclaimed \u201csoil doctor,\u201d Folds said he\u2019s urging local leaders to think \u201ccritically\u201d and outside the box. \u201cWe need to find a way to tell the larger story to get the city and county on board in the same direction,\u201d he added. To assist with creating a more universal policy around natural land care, Folds recommends initiating a committee. \u201cGiven the potential complexity of the subject, I think the best way is a task force that can capture public and professional input into best practices for a comprehensive approach to sustainability,\u201d he said.

Don't forget to recycle materials like paper, glass, and plastic to conserve resources and prevent them from polluting oceans or ending up in landfills.\u201cThere is a need to adopt a plastic-free lifestyle and work towards decarbonising our future. As an individual and dedicated efforts by civil society we can conserve our environment. As part of a global community of over 10 million people in 68 countries, we are proud of our efforts for environment conservation,\u201d said Sandeep Choudhary, Global Founder, Save Earth Mission said..Water, being a precious resource, requires careful conservation for the health of our planet. Simple actions such as fixing leaky faucets, using a broom instead of a hose for outdoor cleaning, and installing water-saving showerheads can significantly reduce water consumption. Additionally, practicing mindfulness in everyday tasks like washing dishes or brushing teeth can help in water conservation.The transportation sector contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Whenever possible, consider eco-friendly alternatives like walking, cycling, carpooling, or using public transportation. With electric vehicles becoming more accessible, making the switch to zero-emission vehicles can greatly reduce your carbon footprint.Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plays a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If feasible, think about installing solar panels on your property or supporting local and national efforts to invest in renewable energy infrastructure.Mindful purchasing choices can have a positive impact on the environment. Opt for products made from sustainable materials and support businesses that prioritize eco-friendly practices and ethical sourcing. Participating in clothing swaps or buying second-hand items can help reduce the demand for new products and limit waste generation.Trees serve as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Engage in tree-planting initiatives or support organizations focusing on reforestation efforts. Additionally, advocate for the preservation of green spaces in your community, as they provide crucial habitats for wildlife and contribute to cleaner air.Reducing energy consumption is essential in minimizing environmental impact. Utilize energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights when not in use, and ensure proper home insulation. Simple actions like adjusting your thermostat and utilizing natural light can lead to significant energy savings over time.The earth is the only home we have and we must do everything in our power to save it. \u201cThere is an important need for collective action to safeguard the planet. There is only one way to address the unprecedented environmental challenges, and that is through community efforts. Everyone needs to come together and work together to protect planet Earth and ensure it can sustain humans and other life forms,\u201d Amit Tiwari, Global Admin Head, Save Earth Mission, said.Protecting the Earth is a collective responsibility that extends beyond governments and large corporations. Each individual possesses the power to effect positive change through daily actions. By incorporating simple, eco-friendly habits into our lives, we can work together towards a more sustainable and thriving planet. Remember that even small contributions, when multiplied globally, can create a significant impact. Let us unite to safeguard the Earth for future generations and foster a healthier and more resilient world.","filter_flag":1}

Kamble, Senior Principal Scientist, CSIR-NCL; and Dr. Ashvini Shete, Senior Scientist, Praj Matrix. R&D (Research & Development) is a vital component of any company's growth and success. It involves the identification and creation of new products or processes that can drive innovation and profitability. Many companies today focus their R&D efforts on achieving sustainable development goals, such as sustainable products, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation, reducing waste, and deploying renewable energy. Green chemistry is a key part of the sustainability journey for chemical industries. It aims to reduce chemical related impact on human health and virtually eliminate contamination of the environment through dedicated and sustainable prevention measures. One of the key components of Green Chemistry is Environment Technology, also referred to as `green\u2019 or `clean\u2019 technology and it aims to conserve, monitor and reduce the negative impact of technology on the environment and the consumption of resources. Sustainable chemistry cannot be conducted in the absence of green chemistry, and it focuses on utilizing more environmentally friendly production methods and materials. The use of green chemistry can decrease the reliance on non-renewable resources and reduce emissions of pollutants and hazardous waste. Overall, R&D, green chemistry, and sustainability goals are interconnected and crucial for businesses and society to achieve long-term success while preserving the environment. A collaborative effort by industry, academia, and government is needed to promote the adoption of the green chemistry technologies necessary to achieve a sustainable society. Key discussion points during panel discussion are: Green chemistry and technology; Emphasis on sustainable product portfolio; Green separation techniques; Waste management and recycling; CO2 capture, storage, and utilization; Green solvents for energy conversion; Cleaner production and green nanotechnologies; and Future challenges in green chemistry and engineering.","filter_flag":1}

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}

With a history spanning over eight decades, HUL has firmly established itself as a leader in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, offering a diverse range of products that touch the lives of millions of Indians every day. From soaps and detergents to personal care items and packaged foods, HUL\u2019s portfolio encompasses an extensive array of well-known and trusted brands. Founded in 1933, HUL has continually evolved and adapted to changing consumer needs, market dynamics, and societal trends. The company\u2019s unwavering commitment to innovation, quality, and sustainability has been the cornerstone of its success. As a subsidiary of the global consumer goods giant, Unilever, HUL combines the strength of a multinational corporation with a deep understanding of the local Indian market, allowing it to cater to the unique preferences and demands of Indian consumers. HUL\u2019s journey began with a focus on manufacturing and selling Vanaspati, or vegetable oil, under the name Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company. However, the company soon diversified its product range to meet the evolving needs of Indian households. Over the years, HUL has introduced numerous iconic brands that have become household names, synonymous with quality and trust. Lux, Lifebuoy, Dove, Sunsilk, Surf Excel, Rin, Pepsodent, and Knorr are just a few examples of HUL\u2019s widely recognized brands. Beyond its commitment to providing high-quality products, HUL also places great emphasis on sustainable and responsible business practices. The company actively engages in initiatives aimed at environmental conservation, community development, and improving the livelihoods of marginalized communities. HUL\u2019s initiatives in water conservation, sanitation, and rural development have garnered widespread acclaim and reflect its dedication to being a responsible corporate citizen. As HUL continues to innovate, expand its product offerings, and explore new market opportunities, it remains deeply rooted in its mission of making sustainable living commonplace. With a focus on customer-centricity, HUL strives to deliver products that enhance the well-being and quality of life for consumers across the country. Through its continued growth and impactful initiatives, Hindustan Unilever remains at the forefront of the FMCG industry in India, embodying a legacy of excellence, innovation, and social responsibility. Foundation and Founders: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) traces its roots back to the summer of 1888 when crates filled with Sunlight soap bars arrived at the Kolkata harbor. These bars, proudly bearing the inscription \u2018Made in England by Lever Brothers,\u2019 marked the beginning of a new era in the marketing of branded Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). This marked the entry of Lever Brothers, the founders of HUL, into the Indian market. Following the success of Sunlight soap, Lever Brothers introduced other iconic brands like Lifebuoy in 1895, Pears, Lux, and Vim. The launch of Vanaspati in 1918 and the introduction of the renowned Dalda brand in 1937 further solidified the company\u2019s position in the Indian market. In 1931, Unilever, the global consumer goods powerhouse, established its first subsidiary in India called Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company. Lever Brothers India Limited was formed in 1933, followed by United Traders Limited in 1935. The three companies merged in November 1956 to create Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL). Notably, HUL became the first foreign subsidiary to offer 10% of its equity to the Indian public. Unilever currently holds 52.10% equity in HUL, while the remaining shares are distributed among approximately 360,675 individual shareholders and financial institutions. This strategic merger and the subsequent public offering cemented HUL\u2019s position as a critical player in the Indian FMCG sector, the stage for its remarkable growth and success in the years to come. 2. Early Years and Initial Products: During its early years, Hindustan Unilever, initially known as Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, focused on manufacturing and selling Vanaspati, a vegetable oil product. However, the company quickly expanded its product range to include a diverse array of consumer goods, such as soaps, detergents, personal care products, and packaged foods. The objective behind starting this business was to meet the growing demands of Indian households and improve the quality of life for consumers. Hindustan Unilever aimed to provide high-quality products that would enhance hygiene standards and cater to the evolving needs of Indian consumers. The founders, Lever Brothers and the Tata Group envisioned a business that would not only contribute to the economic development of the country but also have a positive social impact. By diversifying its product portfolio, Hindustan Unilever aimed to establish a strong foundation for future growth and become a trusted brand in the Indian market. The company sought to offer products that would bring convenience, cleanliness, and well-being to consumers\u2019 lives, thereby creating a lasting impact on Indian households. This objective has remained central to Hindustan Unilever\u2019s business philosophy throughout its journey of over nine decades. 3. Early Hindrances and Challenges: During its early years, Hindustan Unilever faced several hindrances and challenges that tested the company\u2019s resilience. One of the primary obstacles was the competitive market landscape. The consumer goods industry in India was already saturated with established players, making it difficult for a new entrant like Hindustan Unilever to carve out a space for itself. The company had to differentiate its products and build brand awareness among consumers to gain a competitive edge. Another significant challenge came in the form of establishing trust and credibility. Hindustan Unilever was an unfamiliar name in the Indian market, and consumers hesitated to switch from traditional products to those offered by the company. Overcoming this skepticism required consistent efforts in quality assurance, extensive marketing, and targeted promotional campaigns. Furthermore, the company had to navigate through the turbulent period of World War II, which significantly impacted business operations. Resources were scarce, and sourcing raw materials became a formidable challenge. The war disrupted supply chains and distribution networks, leading to production constraints and difficulties in reaching consumers. However, despite these obstacles, Hindustan Unilever managed to adapt and find innovative solutions to ensure continuity and meet the evolving needs of its customers. 4. Current Ownership and Name: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is currently majority-owned by Unilever, a global consumer goods company. Unilever acquired a controlling stake in HUL in the 1950s and has been instrumental in the company\u2019s growth and success. Under Unilever\u2019s ownership, HUL has expanded its product portfolio, strengthened its market presence, and continued to deliver value to its consumers. At the helm of HUL\u2019s leadership, Nitin Paranjpe serves as the Non-Executive Chairman, providing strategic guidance and oversight to the company. With his wealth of experience and industry knowledge, Paranjpe contributes to shaping HUL\u2019s long-term vision and objectives. Sanjiv Mehta has been the CEO and Managing Director of HUL, responsible for driving the company\u2019s growth, implementing key strategies, and leading its day-to-day operations. Mehta has played a crucial role in steering HUL towards sustained success, fostering innovation, and strengthening the company\u2019s position in the market. Furthermore, effective from June 27, 2023, Rohit Jawa will take over as the new CEO and Managing Director of HUL. Jawa\u2019s appointment brings fresh perspectives and expertise to lead the company into its next phase of growth. With a focus on leveraging digital technologies and embracing emerging trends, Jawa aims to further enhance HUL\u2019s competitiveness and market leadership. The seamless transition in leadership from Sanjiv Mehta to Rohit Jawa signifies HUL\u2019s commitment to continuity and sustained excellence in its operations. As HUL continues to thrive under their guidance, the company remains dedicated to delivering high-quality products and driving positive change in the consumer goods industry. 5. Products and Services: Hindustan Unilever offers a wide range of products and services that cater to the diverse needs of consumers across various categories. Under the umbrella of Hindustan Unilever, numerous renowned brands operate in different sectors, ensuring consumers access to high-quality and reliable products. In the beauty and wellbeing category, Hindustan Unilever boasts brands such as Clinic Plus, Dove, Elle 18, Lakme, Pond\u2019s, Pepsodent, Sunsilk, Tresemme, Vaseline, and many more. These brands provide a comprehensive range of beauty and personal care products, including shampoos, conditioners, skincare solutions, hair care products, and oral care items. In the personal care segment, Hindustan Unilever offers popular brands like Axe, Close Up, Lux, Lifebuoy, Rexona, Pears, and more. These brands focus on personal hygiene and provide products such as soaps, shower gels, deodorants, and toothpaste, catering to different consumer preferences and needs.
