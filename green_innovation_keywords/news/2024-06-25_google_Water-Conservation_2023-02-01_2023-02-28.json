Many exhibitors focused on sustainability at the show, highlighting water conservation and waste reduction. \u201cSustainability is not an either\/or game anymore,\u201d said Zach Elkin, president of Beko Home Appliances USA. \u201cDesigners are looking for design, fit, finish \u2014 but also sustainability.\u201d And homeowners \u201care looking for purpose-driven brands.\u201d Among Beko\u2019s introductions was the Harvest Fresh refrigerator, which simulates a 24-hour sun cycle, so that in the morning blue light is used inside the unit, followed by green midday and then red for evening, helping to preserve produce for 30 days, the company said. Related: KBIS introductions showcased color, customization and much more Many companies emphasized water conservation. Moen, for example, added features to its Smart Shower, including a warmup and pause function that can heat up the shower water to the desired temperature and then stop the flow until the user is ready to enter the shower (available through the Moen Smart Water app later this year). Its new Apphia smart faucet can be turned on and off through motion or voice control, and the app can customize the amount and temperature of the water, as well as monitor water usage. The company also won a KBIS award for its Smart Sprinkler controller and smart wireless soil sensors, which monitor the lawn and only water the areas that need it. RainStick\u2019s shower system, a prototype last year, is now available and uses about three gallons of water per minute, instead of the average 25 gallons. It can also be used outdoors if it\u2019s not in direct sunlight. Niagara debuted its Phantom one-piece toilet, which is ADA-compliant and uses 0.8 gallons per minute. Other big themes included customization and offering a wide range of color across appliances, kitchen cabinetry and finishes. The four panels on the front of LG Studio\u2019s MoodUp refrigerator, for example, can be changed individually through an app to whatever the homeowner desires \u2014 190,000 color combinations are possible. Kohler announced that all of its faucets are now available in all of its finishes. German kitchen cabinet maker H\u00e4cker Kitchens expanded its cabinet color options from 190 to almost 2,000 in its Natural Color System to allow for more individualism. Even Kohler\u2019s residential generators upgraded its color options to include bold hues like blue and purple, as well as nature patterns. Tyvarian showed some of its designs for shower and bath walls and floors. Manufactured in Utah, the line is digitally printed on a solid-surface resin and can mimic natural stone and tile, or its custom designs. Kohler\u2019s Numi 2.0 toilet not only offers water efficiency, personalized cleansing and dryer options and heated seats, but also built-in speakers. Related: See who won KBIS\u2019 2023 awards Shades of green, seen in so many other home furnishings categories, were prominent at KBIS. They included GE Caf\u00e9\u2019s new saturated green shade (available Q4), and a lighter green shade called smoky celadon in James Martin Vanities\u2019 line. At Kohler, Spring Green (first released in 1927) was one of two heritage colors that will come back into the Kohler line after a consumer vote on which colors to reintroduce (the other was Peachblow from 1934). Another theme at the show was evoking a spa-like experience in the bathroom. Inspired by Japanese forest bathing, Kohler\u2019s Stillness bathtub includes light, fog and aromas to create a \u201cjourney of the senses,\u201d the company said. One iteration of Stillness includes a hinoki wood base, allowing the water to overflow into it. For a more affordable spa experience, Kohler\u2019s new Sprig wellness brand included a shower infusion system and scented pods so users can bring eucalyptus, lavender or other scents into the shower with them. Duravit debuted its Zencha bath collection, designed by designer Sebastian Herkner. Inspired by Japanese bathing and tea culture, the collection includes a super deep, round bathtub, reminiscent of a Japanese onsen bath and with rounded curves. \u201cMost bathrooms have hard edges,\u201d said Dean Cemastra, northeast regional sales manager for Duravit. This bathtub \u201cbrings the outdoors in\u201d with its curves for a tactile experience. The bathroom is an important space in the home, as one starts the day there, when you need to be energized, and then you end the day there, when you\u2019re winding down, Cemastra said. Addressing rapidly changing technology, LG Signature\u2019s new one-unit wash tower, which combines washing and drying machines together in one unit, allows homeowners to upgrade the technology when needed; for example, they can download a pet cycle if they acquire a pet. Related: What\u2019s on tap in bathroom faucets Uninterrupted surfaces are also in demand. As 45% of consumers bought a refrigerator without an exterior water filling function, Caf\u00e9 debuted a four-door refrigerator that has an autofill pitcher inside the door that can be removed and brought to the table. Kohler\u2019s Suspend kitchen faucet hangs from the ceiling to keep countertops clean. Several exhibitors showed products that keep things tucked away in a drawer. Dometic Home\u2019s DrawBar for wine storage fits into a standard 24-inch drawer while the Dryer Drawer, featured in the Kickstarter area, has a fan that dries washed dishes. H\u00e4cker Kitchens showed its prototype of a countertop that can slide over an induction cooktop when not in use. Other new products: \u2013First-time exhibitor Tulip Cooking offers completely modular gas and induction ranges, which are handmade in Holland. \u2013Airmada showed its Airjet shower drying system that can quickly dry the bathroom to prevent mold and mildew and after-shower humidity. Designed to be built directly into the ceiling and walls. \u2013First-time exhibitor Empava debuted its 12-inch induction cooktop, targeting young homeowners and smaller apartments or homes. It features a childproof lock, nine power level settings, a timer for up to 99 minutes and two heating units. \u2013Founded after an unfortunate potato peel explosion in a garbage disposal, Sepura showed its composter in the Kickstarter section. Ideal for cities where garbage disposal is not allowed, the system can be installed under the sink with a customizable Bluetooth-enabled control button. \u2014 First-time exhibitor Scott Living showed off its new kitchen cabinets, which come in framed and frameless options. The initial launch of this new category included two colors; more will be added.","filter_flag":1}

The company, which was acquired by online food delivery firm Zomato last year, currently has over 400 dark stores that act as warehouses. \"We have identified several new high-potential neighborhoods in existing as well as new cities. We should start seeing the net dark store number increase going forward,\" Dhindsa said. He further said, \"We are seeking opportunities for store openings in high potential areas based on the data our systems generate, the management bandwidth, and time to supply creation.\" Dhindsa, however, said, unlike the food delivery business, the growth in the quick commerce business is dependent on various factors such as availability of products from the brand, seller ability, and supply chain capacity. \"Only when we feel confident that we can provide a great experience for our customers in a high potential location, do we start the process of opening new stores. Currently, we believe that we can comfortably grow our dark store count by around 30-40 percent over the next 12 months,\" he added. This will also depend on the company's ability to find the best and most cost-effective locations for these stores, Dhindsa said. In the third quarter, he said Blinkit was less impacted compared to the food delivery business as \"our typical purchase basket tends to be more skewed towards essential\/ non-discretionary spends.\" The slight downward pressure on average order value might be a result of the slowdown where customers are preferring to buy smaller packs instead of larger ones, he said, adding, \"Overall however, the last quarter was the highest ever in terms of new and returning customers.\" Blinkit posted a revenue of Rs 301 crore in the third quarter that ended December 31, 2022, up 28 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while gross order value (GOV) stood at Rs 1,749 crore, a growth of 18 percent QoQ. \"All of this growth has come without any expansion in our dark store footprint,\" Dhindsa noted. On advertising income becoming a meaningful source of revenue for Blinkit, he said, \"We expect advertisement revenue to be a significant driver for the increase in revenue per order going forward.\" In line with that vision, he said, \"We launched our new self-serve advertising platform for brands - Blinkit Brand Central, in December 2022. The self-serve platform allows brands to bid on their search keywords of interest, as well as create customized brand stores on the platform.\" Blinkit has become a preferred platform for advertising and engagement for over 500 brands, he said, adding \"these brands, large and emerging, use us to build brand awareness and to also push their sales on the platform with performance advertising.\"","filter_flag":1}

Pure Harvest will design, construct and operate high-tech, climate-controlled hybrid food production systems that allow year-round production of high-quality, safe and sustainably-grown fresh fruits & vegetables, free of pesticides, offering Saudi consumers a constant availability of high-quality fresh produce that was never before possible due to the Kingdom\u2019s challenging arid climate. Nadec will utilize its existing infrastructure, far-reaching distribution network, and trusted consumer brands to deliver its partner\u2019s fresh produce to the market. This strategic alliance is closely aligned to the Kingdom\u2019s Vision for a more self-sufficient and sustainable food system. The parties completed and commissioned their first-ever project on December 29, 2021, producing over fifteen (15) varieties of high-quality, hydroponically-grown tomatoes in an approximately 6-hectare high-tech, climate-controlled growing system in Nadec City, Haradh, KSA. This state-of-the-art, sustainable tomato production facility is fully integrated into Nadec\u2019s existing infrastructure, including its innovative 30-MW captive solar farm. The groundbreaking project produces over 5 million kilograms of locally grown tomatoes per annum, harvesting daily throughout the full year, with peak production occurring during the harsh summer months during which local production has historically been impossible, thus contributing directly to the Kingdom\u2019s food sovereignty. This innovative project is the first of many that the partners expect to develop together integrating the full value chain of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) production. Pure Harvest seeks to deploy substantial production capacity over the next five (5) years in KSA, farming a wide range of crops, and Nadec will market these products to its expansive consumer base, hotels, restaurants, and catering partners. The partners share a vision to assist in the transition towards greater food security, water conservation, economic diversification, and sustainability in the Kingdom, as well as the broader GCC region. By originating large-scale, renewable energy-integrated food production infrastructure in KSA, Nadec and Pure Harvest are together making possible local-for-local high-quality, pesticide-residue free, clean, and healthy fresh fruits and vegetables production that, thanks to Pure Harvest\u2019s pioneering production technology, are \u201calways in season\u201d \u2013 proudly serving the Kingdom\u2019s citizens. Dr. Solaiman A. AlTwaijri, CEO of Nadec, stated: \u201cWe are delighted to be partnering with Pure Harvest Smart Farms and to bring their distinctive controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) solutions and expertise to the Kingdom. Nadec has a long tradition of supplying a broad range of staple food products to both the Kingdom and the surrounding region. Moving into the supply of high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables is a natural extension of our legacy. We remain steadfast in our commitment to provide safe, secure, local food supply for our customers, and this partnership is a new opportunity for us to delight those customers, while at the same time making a momentous contribution to the country\u2019s food security and water conservation objectives. Nadec is proud to promote sustainable agricultural development in the Kingdom, in accordance with the ambitious goals of the Saudi Vision 2030, as well as the clear vision of our government.\" Sky Kurtz, Founder & CEO of Pure Harvest Smart Farms, added: \u201cWe are honored to begin this partnership with Nadec. They are a formidable incumbent food supplier with a sterling reputation and brand, sizeable landholdings and enabling infrastructure, and an experienced leadership team. We greatly benefit from Nadec\u2019s strength, and together we are pioneering a new category of fresh produce for the Saudi people \u2013 premium local. High-quality, delicious, safe and affordable fresh produce that is always in season... offering new varieties, new products, and a fundamentally novel fresh produce experience. Our purpose at Pure Harvest is to enable positive change through smart, sustainable farming, and Nadec shares this objective. We are grateful to work with Nadec to accelerate the Kingdom\u2019s vision towards a more sustainable future.\u201d Compared to traditional, lower-tech farming methods, Pure Harvest\u2019s novel resource-efficient food production systems have many advantages aligned to the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 mandate to conserve resources and reduce carbon emissions. Other distinctive features of its systems include the absence of soil and pesticides, as well as leveraging information technologies to make the best possible production decisions, while largely automating certain agricultural processes such as irrigation, pest control, and climate management. Pure Harvest\u2019s growing systems result in very low water consumption per kilogram of production, and is principally powered using Nadec\u2019s renewable energy. Further, Pure Harvest can harvest waste heat from existing fossil fuel power plants and nearby infrastructure and use this energy to offset power demands in its climate systems, while consuming CO 2 (a fundamental ingredient for photosynthesis) to significantly increase its productivity.

Heritage Foods Heritage foods are foods that have a long-standing cultural or historical significance within a particular community or region. These foods often have unique flavours and preparation methods that have been passed down from generation to generation. One example of heritage food is the Native American Three Sisters planting method, which involves planting corn, beans, and squash together in a way that allows each plant to benefit from the others. This method has been used for centuries by Native American tribes and is still used today in many parts of North America. Another example of heritage food is the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, which involves a highly ritualized preparation and presentation of tea. The ceremony dates back to the 16th century and is still practised today in Japan and around the world.

Many heritage foods are grown using traditional methods that prioritize environmental sustainability and biodiversity and often involve local and organic farming practices.
