We continuously update this article throughout the month with new releases we think you should know about. Tech launches These are the first pair of headphones from Sonos, which is well-known for its smart speakers and TV soundbars. I\u2019ve been using them for about a month ahead of launch, and they have some of the best on-ear controls of any headphones I\u2019ve used. There are dedicated buttons for everything plus a sliding media button (called the content key) for volume adjustment and media control \u2014 it works flawlessly, much better than some of the more temperamental touch controls I\u2019ve used in other headphones. Rabinowitz thinks the Sonos Ace headphones look subtle and sophisticated. Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz Outside of controls, these headphones have excellent audio quality, noise-cancellation and hear-through modes, similar to some of our other favorite over-ear headphones from Sony and Apple. They connect over Bluetooth or wired cables (included) and have up to 30 hours of battery life. If you have a Sonos Arc soundbar, you can transfer audio from the soundbar to the headphones by holding down the content key \u2014 this feature is coming to the brand\u2019s other soundbars later this year, according to the brand. Most people on the NBC Select team own, use or have gifted the JBL Clip 4 \u2014 it\u2019s one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. The Clip 5 is a little bigger, a little heavier, a little louder and a lot bassier than the Clip 4, says Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager, who has been using the Clip 5 for about a week ahead of launch. It also has a wider carabiner that makes it easier to clip onto more things, says Rodriguez. It has a 12-hour battery life (up from 10) and is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, similar to the previous version. JBL Clip 4 on the left, JBL Clip 5 on the right. The Clip 5 is slightly larger and has a much taller carabiner. Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz The JBL Clip 5, alongside the JBL Xtreme 4 and JBL Go 4, can be synced together to play audio at the same time (called Auracast), or older JBL speakers with PartyBoost. This is a gamified fitness watch for kids \u2014 there are no apps but video games that encourage interval-based activity instead. The device can call and message specific contacts and has location sharing available for parents. It\u2019s designed with unique software and a Fitbit Ace LTE app that\u2019s separate from Fitbit\u2019s other products. The watch requires a subscription ($9.99 a month) to use. Fujifilm cameras are in high demand for 2024 \u2014 the newly released Fujifilm X100VI is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras but is out of stock everywhere. This new X-T50 isn\u2019t a point-and-shoot but has a similarly compact size and retro style. It has the brand\u2019s latest 40.2MP camera sensor, in-body image stabilization and 20 Film Simulation modes, now controllable with a dedicated dial on the camera\u2019s left. Rabinowitz spent a few minutes shooting with the camera during a rainy-day launch event hosted by Fujifilm. The camera felt surprisingly small and compact, especially with the brand\u2019s new compact zoom lens. Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz Within the Fujifilm camera lineup, it is priced between the more premium X-T5 and lower-priced X-T30 II and X-S20. Keychron makes some of the best keyboards, but this is the brand\u2019s first non-mechanical model. The B1 Pro is a very slim (14.5 millimeters at its tallest point) scissor-switch keyboard, similar to a laptop keyboard. It connects to computers with Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or wired cable. Like the brand\u2019s mechanical keyboards, it has switches on the top to toggle between Mac and Windows, as well as different connectivity modes. It has up to eight months of battery life, according to the brand. The brand also launched the B3 Pro, which has the same design but a full-sized number pad. Fitness and travel launches The Normatec Elite Compression Boots are Hyperpiece\u2019s latest recovery product. They weigh 3.2 pounds each and offer seven adjustable compression settings so you can customize your leg massage. You can set the boots to perform the same massage on both legs or run separate sessions. The compression boots\u2019 battery lasts for about four hours. They connect to the Hyperice app via Bluetooth, or you can control them via exterior buttons. Marlow\u2019s newest products help you stay cozy while traveling. The Mini Pillow and Fleece Travel Blanket are compact enough to pack inside your carry-on luggage or weekender, and they\u2019re sold individually or as a set. The Mini Pillow is adjustable \u2014 you can unzip two sides for a plush feel, unzip one size for a medium plush feel or zip two sides for a firm feel. It comes with a pillowcase and carrying bag, and there\u2019s shredded gel-infused cooling memory foam inside. You can place the pillow under your head, between your knees or behind your back. The Fleece Blanket also comes with a carrying case. Both products are machine-washable. Pet launches This water fountain is Petlibro\u2019s first product for dogs. It has a whirlpool water flow that pulls loose fur, food crumbs, dirt and other grime into the replaceable five-layer filter, which ensures that your dog always has clean, fresh drinking water. The fountain\u2019s transparent tank has a 2.1-gallon capacity, and you can refill it by pouring water directly into the serving tray. Its high walls and buffer zone prevent water from spilling onto your floors, and since it disassembles, it\u2019s easy to clean. Dogs of any size can use the water fountain, but it\u2019s specifically designed for medium and large pets. Why trust NBC Select?

Initially, reports pointed to a similar redesign for a 27-inch or bigger iMac with multiple color options and an Apple Silicon processor The early rumors never panned out and Apple refreshed the 24-inch iMac with M3 with no word of a larger model. Following that announcement, Apple confirmed it wasn't working on a 27-inch model. Conflicting rumors and reports are nothing new for unannounced Apple products. Some expected an iMac Pro revival with Apple Silicon, but since the Mac Pro is now running M2 Ultra, it's less likely. The 27-inch iMac was discontinued after the Studio Display and Mac Studio were announced at an Apple event in March 2022. Now, Apple says it isn't working on a 27-inch model, but that doesn't necessarily mean it never will or that it could be working on a larger one still. Apple cemented the idea that a 27-inch or larger model wasn't imminent by saying the 24-inch iMac was the perfect size that fits between the 21.5-inch and 27-inch displays from previous models. Other rumors suggest a 30-inch or larger iMac could launch sometime in 2025. Rumors around a larger iMac model have largely dropped off in early 2024. New iMac Features We will examine the possibility of each new iMac release below. Rumors now point to a 30-inch or larger iMac with Apple Silicon that would be a larger version of the 24-inch iMac. An iMac Pro is increasingly unlikely and hasn't been rumored by reliable sources in recent history. Design Like the 24-inch iMac, the new larger model will shrink the display bezels, have a smaller chin, and be much thinner with a uniform thickness throughout. The previous 27-inch iMac weighed nearly 20 pounds, and thanks to the redesign, we expect it to weigh much less, proportionally. The new larger iMac will take on Apple's new design philosophy The color selection will largely depend on which processor type is used. If this is a pro-grade iMac with Pro and Max chipsets, Apple will only release it in space gray or silver with black bezels. A consumer-grade M-series processor would mean multiple color options and an off-white bezel around the display. Apple discontinued the space gray Magic accessories alongside the iMac Pro in 2021. However, a new set of color-match accessories could arrive with a new iMac Pro. The new Magic Keyboard has Touch ID but is only available in alternate colors when ordering a specific color iMac. Apple sells only the basic white version separately. A possible color-matched Magic Keyboard and Mouse The redesigned larger iMac will likely be slightly thicker than the 24-inch model to account for airflow and cooling. The Pro and Max M-series processors may be highly efficient, but they still generate a lot of heat during intensive operations. The display stand will likely have an identical design to the 24-inch iMac, which isn't ideal. Many have been clamoring for a new iMac stand with some adjustability, but it is doubtful Apple will implement such a design in this model. Display Early rumors of the new iMac suggested that Apple would increase the display size by shrinking the bezels around the screen. This would give users a 30-inch or 32-inch display similar to the Pro Display XDR. The new iMac may have a 30-inch or larger display with ProMotion and mini-LED Analysts and leakers have gone back and forth on display size, with the most recent rumors pointing to the 30-inch or larger size. Apple says it is not working on a 27-inch iMac. As with color design, the display technology in use will largely depend on what processor Apple uses for this machine. An iMac Pro-type model would have ProMotion, mini-LED, and a higher pixel density. A consumer-focused model would have a similar display to the existing iMac 5K with little to no changes overall. The 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro saw significant display upgrades over previous models. Apple will likely implement similar changes in a pro-focused iMac redesign. ProMotion is a technology that enables 120Hz variable refresh rates. This means scrolling content, animations, and some video games will look smoother, and since there's no battery to be concerned with, more content will run at high refresh rates without issue. mini-LED and ProMotion are used in the 2021 MacBook Pro and later models Apple could implement the mini-LED backlight in either pro or non-pro models, but some rumors suggest it won't be used in the larger iMac at all. If implemented, the display will have many more dimming zones and will be able to represent black space much more accurately. One report suggests that the large display may not feature as many dimmable zones as the iPad Pro or MacBook Pro displays. It isn't clear if this is for cost reduction or technological difficulties implementing the technology in a larger display. Apple could increase the overall pixel count for more density and native 2x Retina scaling. This may mean using a 5.5K panel in a 27-inch display or a 6K panel in a 30-inch or larger display \u2014 similar to the 24-inch iMac, which uses a 4.5K panel. Rumors suggest Apple could go with a 32-inch display for an iMac launched in 2025. Processor There are multiple processor options available for the new iMac. Apple could take a similar route to the Mac mini and offer M3 and M3 Pro processors, or, if this is more of an iMac Pro refresh, it would use M3 Pro and M3 Max. Customers would be able to choose between processors when configuring their machines. For example, the existing M2 Pro has a 10-core CPU with a 16-core GPU, while the M2 Max has a 12-core CPU with a 30-core GPU for the base versions. Unlike the Intel models, Apple doesn't offer discrete graphics options. Instead, the integrated graphics in the high-end M-series processors are expected to be more than enough for most applications. In addition, the neural engine and media engines built into the processors also add increased performance with specific tasks. The M3 Pro and M3 Max support up to 36GB and 128GB of RAM, respectively, and 8TB SSD storage, and that may increase with future generations. These processors also enable more Thunderbolt ports and general I\/O, but the upper limit isn't known. Apple announced the M3 processor in the 24-inch iMac with no word of a larger model. Gurman positioned the larger iMac release for late 2024. Ming-Chi Kuo has pushed that timeline further into 2025. Webcam and Ports Apple will likely move to a 1080p webcam just as it did with the 24-inch model. Apple could introduce any number of port combinations It isn't clear precisely what ports could be introduced with the new iMac. In any case, be it an iMac Pro or consumer machine, it will likely have more varied ports than the 24-inch model. Three or four Thunderbolt 4 ports are possible since the Pro and Max M-series chips support more than two. It isn't known if these processors can support four Thunderbolt ports in parallel, but three are present on the new MacBook Pros, and future updates can always increase this capacity. Apple could also add an SD card slot to the side of the display or an HDMI port to the back for adding an additional monitor. However, it may be simpler to keep multiple Thunderbolt 4 and USB-A ports instead. The power adapter on the 24-inch iMac has an optional ethernet connection. Some speculate that Apple could add more ports to this power adapter, but the location of the ports does not offer a lot of options. Rumors place a 30-inch iMac (or larger) with an M-series chipset being announced sometime in 2025.","filter_flag":1}
