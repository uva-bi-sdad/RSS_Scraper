Green bond issuance volumes have surged over the past several years as companies and governments have increasingly used them to finance their environmental sustainability and transition initiatives. Despite slower volumes last year amidst a broader issuance market pullback, issuances have rebounded, reaching record volumes in the first half of this year, and representing around 9% of global bond market issuance, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The new products include \u201c20% Green Bond\u201d and \u201c3x Green Bond Tilted\u201d versions of the Bloomberg Global Aggregate, Bloomberg Global Corporate, and Bloomberg Global Treasury Indices. The company noted that the year-to-date return for the Bloomberg Global Aggregate 20% Green Bond Index is 0.75% above that of its parent benchmark, which it said highlighted the opportunity for additional returns for investors with an appetite for sustainability-focused investment. Bloomberg said that the indices can be further customized to meet specific individual investor needs with additional fields such as business involvement exclusions, EU Taxonomy inputs, regulatory screens, and custom sector weightings, and noted that a custom Bloomberg Euro Treasury Green Bond Tilted Index has been licensed to Amundi for the launch of a new ETF. Jonathan Gardiner, product manager for Sustainable Indices at Bloomberg Index Services, said:","filter_flag":1}
