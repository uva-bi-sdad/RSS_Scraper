Currently, the earth is about 1.1C warmer than in the late 1800s. As outlined in the Paris Agreement, the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, limit global warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably limit the increase to 1.5C by 2050. According to a new report by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), even if each country\u2019s climate change pledges are kept, global temperatures are projected to miss the mark and instead suggest a 2.8C hike by the end of the century. Despite the present energy crisis, inflation, economic uncertainty, and the war in Ukraine, companies face pressure from investors and consumers to reduce GHG emissions, which continue to intensify as temperatures rise. While this is true in many industries, it is magnified in the energy market as it has the biggest impact in both emitting GHG emissions and transitioning to green and clean energy. Another inescapable future is the demand for electricity, expected to triple by 2050 as living standards grow. All future scenarios point to renewable energy, particularly solar and wind, to lead the power generation mix by 2050. Along with batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), the unit cost of solar and wind continue to fall while their use continues to rise. However, as the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine have highlighted, there is a need for an energy source that is secure, produces low emissions, and is dispatchable. Nuclear may, for example, be the complement to renewable energy to transition to a more sustainable future. A key factor in accelerating this transition is using digital technologies to control product data for wind, solar, and nuclear. All companies run on product data\u2014it touches all phases of a product\u2019s\/plant\u2019s lifecycle. Those that can harness their data outperform their competition. They\u2019re able to innovate, scale, and transform, merging their digitalization efforts sustainably and making them more resilient competitors in the marketplace. They do this with a strategic business approach known as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). Although PLM is often associated with engineering and software systems, generally known as \u201cPLM solutions,\u201d PLM is a much broader strategic approach to managing all aspects of the product, services, and processes directly linked to the business strategy. It supports the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, and use of product definition information, supporting the extended enterprise (that is, customers, design, operations, supply partners, etc.) as it spans from concept through end of life of a product or plant. PLM integrates people, processes, business systems, and information that empowers the business, enables product and process innovation, and enhances both top- and bottom-line business performance. Wind turbine manufacturers, for example, use PLM to control the configuration of their product in both their new product introduction process, as well as their requisition-to-order processes, customer requirements, and other regulations. They make use of PLM solutions, product configurators, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and other digital solutions to manage all the components, materials, and processes that make up a wind turbine. Each wind turbine is comprised of thousands of parts, including software, much of which comes from an upstream supply chain regularly consisting of more than a thousand suppliers. For any given order, these parts or, in some cases, functions are configured with PLM, resulting in a bill-of-material (BOM) throughout various phases of the product\u2019s lifecycle. The after-service market is crucial in the wind industry. Therefore, using PLM to create digital twins\u2014virtual replicas of these physical assets, which are kept up to date throughout service\u2014is critical not just for performance, but also to increase efficiency and provide useful insights for future services, upgrades, retirement, and new products. Wind and solar companies are some of the most sustainable in the world. In both January 2022 and 2023, Corporate Knights (a Toronto, Canada\u2013based sustainable-economy media and research company) named Vestas, the largest wind turbine provider, as the \u201cmost sustainable corporation in the world\u201d from a list of 6,720 publicly traded companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. Vestas is committed to being a carbon-neutral company by 2030 without using carbon offsets and by producing zero-waste wind turbines by 2040. To accomplish this, Vestas, and competitors such as GE Vernova, Siemens Gamesa, and others are incorporating circular design concepts, reducing carbon emissions, and reducing waste production from manufacturing. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of the GHG emission is locked in during product design. Therefore, wind original equipment manufacturers are making concerted efforts from the outset to design sustainability into their products with the end of life in mind. To accomplish this, they are making greater use of digital threads\u2014the ability to connect product data flow and achieve an integrated view of an asset\u2019s data (that is, its digital twin) throughout its lifecycle across traditionally siloed functional domains. Another key is reducing the product carbon footprint (PCF). So, for each component or material they need to know the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e). This extends into their supply chain where up to 99% of their carbon footprint is typically embedded in their product manufacturing process. PLM can increase the visibility of the product carbon footprint of the materials used, including those from suppliers, thus reducing the environmental impact. Vestas is also pursuing a zero-waste product by 2040. While 80% of their average wind turbine can already be fully recycled or repurposed, there are challenges for the turbine rotors where composite components made of epoxy resin and fibers make it more difficult to recycle cost effectively. \u201cIntegrating sustainability into everything we do is a part of our vision to become the global leader in sustainable energy solutions. This also includes our ambition to be the safest, most-inclusive, and socially responsible company in the energy industry. We want to create a place to work where a diverse workforce of people thrive, grow, and feel that they belong,\u201d said Brian Lindgaard Jensen, vice president with Vestas. The solar industry, entailing solar panels or photovoltaic panels (PV), uses PLM in a similar fashion and is similarly challenged designing for sustainability with an increasing emphasis on waste reduction and recycling at the end of a solar project\u2019s lifespan. A 2016 study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates the recyclable materials in old solar modules will be worth $15 billion in recoverable assets by the year 2050. The two primary solar technologies are crystalline silicon, with most of the market share, and thin-film PV, which is used for applications such as building rooftops. Many of the materials that make up PV panels could be highly recyclable. Glass composes most of the weight of a solar panel (about 75%) and glass recycling is already a well-established industry. Other materials that are easily recyclable include the aluminum frame, copper wire, and the plastic junction boxes. The challenge is that existing products were designed for durability with polymer layers that seal the panels from exposure to the elements. The lack of designing for disassembly requires that existing designs require thermal processing at 500C to loosen the adhesive. In Europe, which has a more mature solar industry, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) of the European Union helped found a member-based organization called PV Cycle to build out a robust recycling infrastructure. Although similar regulations are expected in the U.S., as of now, only Washington state has passed legislation requiring manufacturers of PV modules to provide for recycling. Leading thin-film solar manufacturer First Solar started a voluntary recycling program in 2006 and continues to perfect its processes. Today, the company recovers more than 90% of the semiconductor material for reuse in new solar modules. It also recovers 90% of the glass for reuse in new glass container products. As the renewable energy market continues to grow, the use of PLM throughout a circular product lifecycle that spans from raw material sourcing through end-of-life recycling, recovery, and remanufacturing will be critical. And, not only through enhancement with digital twins, digital thread, and configuration management, but also in collaboration across many functions both within the company and with customers and their supply chain. In addition to renewables, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in energy prices has highlighted the need for countries to rethink their energy security strategy. The need for a more diverse and domestic supply of energy is clear, leading to a resurgence in nuclear power. Historically, nuclear power has been cost-prohibitive compared to coal and natural gas, but the combination of the need for energy security, additional low-carbon emissions, and flexible baseload power that can supplement renewable energy is key. Nuclear energy provides 413 GW of capacity operating in 32 countries while avoiding 1.5 gigatonnes (Gt) of GHG emissions and 180 billion cubic meters (bcm) of global gas demand each year. As a result, many counties are scaling back their plans to phase out nuclear, and others, such as the UK, are planning for new reactors. Many of these plants were originally designed more than 40 years ago, before PLM was broadly accepted, but PLM is being adopted, typically during retrofits. So, as an example, if a unit gets a new steam turbine designed using PLM, the utility company can use this data to help them manage their power plant more efficiently. When it comes to older plants, the use of PLM and modern asset management largely comes down to the choice for more efficiency and improved data consistency. The challenge of net zero has also intensified the development in small modular reactor (SMR) technologies. SMRs, generally defined as advanced nuclear reactors with a capacity of less than 300 MW, have strong political and institutional support, with substantial grants in the U.S., and increased support in Canada, the UK, and France. However, SMRs have not yet proven to be financially viable, and few will be online before 2030. That said, they are attracting private investors, they will have lower capital costs, inherent safety and waste management attributes, and reduced project risks may improve social acceptance. The companies investing in advanced SMR technology, such as NuScale Power, GE-Hitachi Energy, and others, use PLM, and in some cases enable almost all their employees to access data under configuration control. The reason for this is the requirements, quality, safety, and other data and documentation required for licensing are interrelated and critical to their business. While the scale may be different from wind turbines and solar plants, and the regulatory requirements more stringent, the PLM concepts and technologies are quite similar. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report highlighted that global CO 2 emissions continue to rise at unprecedented levels. Energy companies need to accelerate their innovation, reduce their PCFs, implement more circular waste reduction, and do so while keeping their costs down with greater collaboration, which is exactly what increased digitalization and PLM offer. We are witnessing the most dramatic transition in energy and the markets impacted by energy in our lifetime. PLM is playing a key role in accelerating the transition to green energy and a decarbonized, sustainable, and circular economy that will benefit our businesses, our customers, and the future of our planet for generations to come. \u2014Mark Reisig is executive consultant, and Sustainability and Green Energy practice director, with CIMdata.","filter_flag":1}

Here, the important transition is one from classical value and supply chains to value networks and ecosystems. Integrating renewable energy into urban infrastructure development will be crucial in providing access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for every city resident. And it\u2019s not just a matter of contracting with suppliers for the provision of low-carbon electricity. Rather, cities will need to think holistically about energy and how different parts of the supply chain for electricity, heat, transport and infrastructure can become more efficient. And they need to tap into the growing movement towards a circular economy, in which the waste products of one entity can become the feedstock for another. Leaning into these transformations has the potential to yield significant CO2 reductions. Moving forwards, decentralised renewable energy generation needs to be developed through on-site generation and the integration of innovations such as microgrids, the integration of photovoltaic elements into building design, and fuel cell and battery storage for residential and commercial buildings and districts. Green hydrogen offers great potential if it can be produced at scale with a lower carbon footprint than current transportation energy supplies. Some green hydrogen projects are already operating. In South Korea, a fuel cell power plant in Incheon is the first large-scale (78 megawatt [MW]) hydrogen power plant; it provides electricity to 250,000 households and heat to a further 44,000. In Lower Saxony, Germany, hydrogen trains from the manufacturer Alstom will replace 14 diesel trains. From a demand point of view, the best and easiest way to drive a low-carbon future is to use energy as efficiently as possible. That can involve helping consumers conserve energy through better home insulation, and incentivising them to walk, cycle or use public transport instead of driving. Here, too, cities are already leading the charge. Paris in June 2022 took the decision to ban motorised transport from the centre of the city. Developing new infrastructure that supports a low-carbon urban ecosystem is the best way to bridge the gap between the supply of clean energy and the demand for any energy that makes life convenient and maintains the standards of living that people have come to expect from the fossil fuel era\u2014or, even better, raises those standards.","filter_flag":1}

But, according to agency records obtained by ProPublica and the Guardian, the production of one of the fuels could emit air pollution that is so toxic, one out of four people exposed to it over a lifetime could get cancer. \u201cThat kind of risk is obscene,\u201d said Linda Birnbaum, former head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. \u201cYou can\u2019t let that get out.\u201d That risk is 250,000 times greater than the level usually considered acceptable by the EPA division that approves new chemicals. Chevron hasn\u2019t started making this fuel yet, the EPA said. When the company does, the cancer burden will disproportionately fall on people who have low incomes and are Black because of the population that lives within three miles of the refinery that will produce the fuel in Pascagoula, Mississippi. ProPublica and the Guardian asked Maria Doa, a scientist who worked at the EPA for 30 years, to review the document laying out the risk. Doa, who once ran the division that managed the risks posed by chemicals, was so alarmed by the cancer threat that she initially assumed it was a typographical error. \u201cEPA should not allow these risks in Pascagoula or anywhere,\u201d said Doa, who now is the senior director of chemical policy at Environmental Defense Fund. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Guardian, an EPA spokesperson wrote that the agency\u2019s lifetime cancer risk calculation is \u201ca very conservative estimate with \u2018high uncertainty\u2019\u201d, meaning the government erred on the side of caution in calculating such a high risk. That kind of risk is obscene. EPA should not allow these risks in Pascagoula or anywhere Linda Birnbaum, former head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Under federal law, the EPA can\u2019t approve new chemicals with serious health or environmental risks unless it comes up with ways to minimize the dangers. And if the EPA is unsure, the law allows the agency to order lab testing that would clarify the potential health and environmental harms. In the case of these new plastic-based fuels, the agency didn\u2019t do either of those things. In approving the fuel, the EPA didn\u2019t require any lab tests, air monitoring or controls that would reduce the release of the cancer-causing pollutants or people\u2019s exposure to them. In January 2022, the EPA announced the initiative to streamline the approval of petroleum alternatives in what a press release called \u201cpart of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s actions to confront the climate crisis\u201d. While the program cleared new fuels made from plants, it also signed off on fuels made from plastics even though they are petroleum-based and contribute to the release of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Although there\u2019s no mention of discarded plastics in the press release or on the EPA website\u2019s description of the program, an agency spokesperson told ProPublica and the Guardian that it allows their production because the initiative also covers fuels made from waste. The spokesperson said that 16 of the 34 fuels the program approved so far are made from waste. She would not say how many of those are made from plastic and stated that such information was confidential. All of the waste-based fuels are the subject of consent orders, documents the EPA issues when it finds that new chemicals or mixtures may pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d to human health or the environment. The documents specify those risks and the agency\u2019s instructions for mitigating them. But the agency won\u2019t turn over these records or reveal information about the waste-based fuels, not even their names or chemical structures. Without those basic details, it is nearly impossible to determine which of the thousands of consent orders on the EPA website apply to this program. In keeping this information secret, the EPA cited a legal provision that allows companies to claim as confidential any information that would give their competitors an advantage in the marketplace. Nevertheless, ProPublica and the Guardian did obtain one consent order that covers a dozen Chevron fuels made from plastics that were reviewed under the program. Although the EPA had blacked out sections, including the chemicals\u2019 names, the document showed that the fuels that Chevron plans to make at its Pascagoula refinery present serious health risks, including developmental problems in children and cancer and harm to the nervous system, reproductive system, liver, kidneys, blood and spleen. Aside from the chemical that carries a 25% lifetime risk of cancer from smokestack emissions, another of the Chevron fuels ushered in through the program is expected to cause cancer in 1.2 of 10,000 people \u2013 a rate also far higher than the agency allows for the general population. The EPA division that screens new chemicals typically limits cancer risk from a single air pollutant to one case of cancer per million people. The agency also calculated that air pollution from one of the fuels is expected to cause cancer in 7.1 of every 1,000 workers \u2013 more than 70 times the level the EPA\u2019s new chemicals division usually considers acceptable for workers. In addition to the chemicals released through the creation of fuels from plastics, the people living near the Chevron refinery are exposed to an array of other cancer-causing pollutants, as ProPublica reported in 2021. In that series, which mapped excess cancer risk from lifetime exposure to air pollution across the US, the greatest risk was one cancer case per 53 people, in Port Arthur, Texas.

Photograph: Eric Gay\/AP The one-in-four lifetime cancer risk from breathing the emissions from the Chevron fuel is higher even than the lifetime risk of lung cancer for current smokers. In an email Chevron spokesperson Ross Allen wrote: \u201cIt is incorrect to say there is a one-in-four cancer risk from smoke-stack emissions. I urge you [to] avoid suggesting otherwise.\u201d Asked to clarify what exactly was wrong with the statement, Allen wrote that Chevron disagrees with ProPublica and the Guardian\u2019s \u201ccharacterization of language in the EPA consent order\u201d. That document, signed by a Chevron manager at its refinery in Pascagoula, quantified the lifetime cancer risk from the inhalation of smokestack air as 2.5 cancers per 10 people, which can also be stated as one in four. In a subsequent phone call, Allen said: \u201cWe do take care of our communities, our workers and the environment. Generally, this is job one for Chevron.\u201d In a separate written statement, Chevron said it followed the EPA\u2019s process under the Toxic Substances Control Act: \u201cThe TSCA process is an important first step to identify risks and if EPA identifies unreasonable risk, it can limit or prohibit manufacture, processing or distribution in commerce during applicable review period.\u201d The Chevron statement also said: \u201cOther environmental regulations and permitting processes govern air, water and handling hazardous materials. Regulations under the Clean Water, Clean Air and Resource Conservation and Recovery Acts also apply and protect the environment and the health and safety of our communities and workers.\u201d Similarly, the EPA said that other federal laws and requirements might reduce the risk posed by the pollution, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) regulations for worker protection, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and rules that apply to refineries. But Osha has warned the public not to rely on its outdated chemical standards. The refinery rule calls for air monitoring only for one pollutant: benzene. The Clean Water Act does not address air pollution. And the new fuels are not regulated under the Clean Air Act, which applies to a specific list of pollutants. Nor can states monitor for the carcinogenic new fuels without knowing their names and chemical structures. We asked Scott Throwe, an air pollution specialist who worked at the EPA for 30 years, how existing regulations could protect people in this instance. Now an independent environmental consultant, Throwe said the existing testing and monitoring requirements for refineries couldn\u2019t capture the pollution from these new plastic-based fuels because the rules were written before these chemicals existed. There is a chance that equipment designed to limit the release of other pollutants may incidentally capture some of the emissions from the new fuels, he said. But there\u2019s no way to know whether that is happening. View image in fullscreen A redacted section of an EPA consent order covering plastic-derived fuels. Photograph: EPA Under federal law, companies have to apply to the EPA for permission to introduce new chemicals or mixtures. But manufacturers don\u2019t have to supply any data showing their products to be safe. So the EPA usually relies on studies of similar chemicals to anticipate health effects. In this case, the EPA used a mixture of chemicals made from crude oil to gauge the risks posed by the new plastic-based fuels. Chevron told the EPA the chemical components of its new fuel but didn\u2019t give the precise proportions. So the EPA had to make some assumptions, for instance that people absorb 100% of the pollution emitted. Asked why it didn\u2019t require tests to clarify the risks, a spokesperson wrote that the \u201cEPA does not believe these additional test results would change the risks identified nor the unreasonable risks finding\u201d. In her three decades at the EPA, Maria Doa of the Environmental Defense Fund had never seen a chemical with that high of a cancer risk that the agency allowed to be released into a community without restrictions. \u201cThe only requirement seems to be just to use the chemicals as fuel and have the workers wear gloves,\u201d she said. While companies have made fuels from discarded plastics before, this EPA program gives them the same administrative break that renewable fuels receive: a dedicated EPA team that combines the usual six regulatory assessments into a single report. The irony is that Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, which this initiative was meant to support, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost the production of renewable fuels. Truly renewable energy sources, such as plants or algae, can be regenerated in a short period of time. While there is significant debate about whether ethanol, which is made from corn, and other plant-based renewable fuels are really better for the environment than fossil fuels, there is no question that plastics are not renewable and that their production and conversion into fuel releases climate-harming pollution. Under the EPA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard, bio-based fuels must meet specific criteria related to their biological origin as well as the amount by which they reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels. But under this new approach, fuels made from waste don\u2019t have to meet those targets, the agency said. In its written statement, Chevron said that \u201cplastics are an essential part of modern life and plastic waste should not end up in unintended places in the environment. We are taking steps to address plastic waste and support a circular economy in which post-use plastic is recycled, reused or repurposed.\u201d But environmentalists say such claims are just greenwashing. Whatever it\u2019s called, the creation of fuel from plastic is in some ways worse for the climate than simply making it directly from fossil fuels. Over 99% of all plastic is derived from fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. To produce fuel from plastics, additional fossil fuels are used to generate the heat that converts them into petrochemicals that can be used as fuel. \u201cIt adds an extra step,\u201d said Veena Singla, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThey have to burn a lot of stuff to power the process that transforms the plastic.\u201d Less than 6% of plastic waste is recycled in the US. Scientists estimate that more than a million tons of that unrecycled plastic ends up in the environment each year, killing marine mammals and polluting the world. Plastic does not fully decompose; instead it eventually breaks down into tiny bits, some of which wind up inside our bodies. As the public\u2019s awareness of the health and environmental harm of plastic grows, the industry has found itself under increasing pressure to find a use for the waste. The idea of creating fuel from plastic offers the comforting feeling that plastics are sustainable. But the release of cancer-causing pollution is just one of several significant problems that have plagued attempts to convert discarded plastic into new products. One recent study by scientists from the Department of Energy found that the economic and environmental costs of turning old plastic into new resources using a process called pyrolysis were 10 to 100 times higher than those of making new plastics from fossil fuels. The lead author said similar issues plague the use of this process to create fuels from plastics. Chevron buys oil that another company extracts from discarded plastics through pyrolysis. Though the parts of the consent order that aren\u2019t redacted don\u2019t mention that this oil came from waste plastics, a related EPA record makes this clear. The cancer risks come from the pollution emitted from Chevron\u2019s smokestacks when the company turns that oil into fuel. The EPA attributed its decision to embark on the streamlined program in part to its budget, which it says has been \u201cessentially flat for the last six years\u201d. The EPA spokesperson said that the agency \u201chas been working to streamline its new chemicals work wherever possible\u201d. The New Chemicals Division, which houses the program, has been under particular pressure because updates to the chemicals law gave it additional responsibilities and faster timetables. That division of the agency is also the subject of an ongoing EPA inspector general investigation into whistleblowers\u2019 allegations of corruption and industry influence over the chemical approval process. This story was updated on 1 March 2023. A previous version misstated what happens to unrecycled plastic in the US. Scientists estimate that more than a million tons of it end up in the environment each year. It is not known precisely how much of this plastic from the US winds up in the oceans.","filter_flag":1}

According to the company, the diets feature upcycled ingredients, achieve climate neutrality through production and packaging, and a percentage of sales will benefit seagrass restoration projects in the Baltic Sea. The diets aim to meet a growing audience of sustainability-minded pet owners. VAFO cited recent surveys, stating that up to 61% of pet owners say they would like to know the environmental impacts of their pet food product purchases. To meet these demands, Planet Pet Society diets incorporate \u201csecond-chance ingredients,\u201d also known as upcycled ingredients from the meat, fruit and vegetable production industries. The brand will add value back into raw animal products from primary production that would otherwise go to waste, including meat trimmings, offal, cartilage and fish skin. VAFO has also formulated its new brand with dehydrated apple peels sourced from a local cidery, as well as vegetable pulps left over from primary production. According to VAFO, these ingredients are nutritious and deliver essential amino acids while also reducing food waste. \u201cUpcycling is a new way of looking at the selection of quality, nutritionally rich ingredients with a smaller impact on the planet,\u201d said Karol\u00edna \u010c\u00e1pov\u00e1, head of product at VAFO Group. \u201cThey\u2019re ideal for covering the natural nutritional needs of dogs and cats with a primary component of animal protein, while at the same time easing the strain on the environment. We\u2019ve developed a food that\u2019s friendly to the environment and reduces food waste. And it\u2019s because we love nature, just like our four-legged buddies do, so we want to do what we can to protect it for them.\u201d VAFO has also dedicated the brand to use only local raw ingredients, renewable energy sources and fully recyclable packaging to make Planet Pet Society 100% climate neutral. Additionally, the new brand will support biodiversity by donating 1% of its sales to the John Nurminen Foundation, which will use the funds to facilitate seagrass restoration projects in the Baltic Sea. Planet Pet Society will support the transplanting of eelgrass seedlings to areas in the Baltic Sea where the seagrass has disappeared. \u201cWe decided to support the seagrass restoration project in the Baltic Sea because its waters bathe the shores of almost all the countries in which VAFO has branches,\u201d \u010c\u00e1pov\u00e1 added. \u201cPut simply, we\u2019re helping out in the places where we have activities.\u201d Planet Pet Society is aligned with VAFO Group\u2019s five-pillar sustainability goals, which include: reducing carbon dioxide emissions across the business; applying fully recyclable packaging to 95% of its products; employing renewable energy sources in production; advancing responsible employee conduct; and upping the use of sustainable ingredients in its formulas by 50%.

The Off-Grid Energy Access Fund (FEI-OGEF), Cordaid and Qotto\u2019s existing investors also participated in the round. Qotto told TechCrunch it plans to scale in existing markets, and expand to Ivory Coast where it is set to begin operations by next month. Founded in 2016, Qotto designs and distributes standalone solar kits and lanterns to individuals residing in the least electrified regions of Africa. Through a pay-to-own model , it avails its products to individuals in sub-Saharan Africa that are off-grid owing to underdeveloped national power grids. \u201cFor Ivory Coast, due to its consistent pace of development relative to the broader West Africa region, and after having tested and optimized operations and services in Benin and Burkina Faso, Qotto is well prepared for a market entry. Moreover, the customers who have been able to test the Qotto products in the country have expressed a need and desire to see Qotto enter the Ivory Coast market,\u201d said Qotto co-founder and president, Jean-Baptiste Lenoir. Qotto says IBL is drawing its roadmap for East Africa expansion too, after signing a partnership and agreeing to offer off-grid solutions in the region. The expansion, to take place by September this year, will happen alongside that of IBL, which is planning \u201cto strengthen its position in East Africa and to develop its renewable energies exposure.\u201d \u201cTogether, we see a great opportunity for the essential services and large Solar Home Systems offerings provided by Qotto,\u201d said Lenoir. The growth bid follows the planned introduction of new products in the market, including financial services and internet access hotspots, as Qotto evolves into an all-rounded essential services operator. \u201cOur edge is that our presence in rural areas allows us to understand the customers and their needs so that we can propose innovative products based on our technical platform,\u201d he said. The planned financial services include micro-insurance, micro-credit and micro-savings products, designed in collaboration with partners such as SUNU, a large insurer in West Africa. Qotto said it has already sold thousands of life insurance contracts. The internet hotspots will be located in high foot traffic areas like shops, restaurants or bars. \u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, 650 million people do not have access to electricity, 550 million do not have access to the internet and 800 million do not have access to financial services. Many of these customers are overlapping in their needs for off-grid solutions, connectivity and financial services,\u201d said Lenoir. \u201cOur model helps to solve these critical issues under a single solution \u2014 which we call \u2018essential services,\u2019 backed by our proprietary technology stack. In addition, we are aligned with the SDGs to serve customers and improve impact indicators in our markets,\u201d he said. Renewable energy solutions by companies like Qotto are bridging the energy access gap in the least electrified countries like South Sudan, Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Madagascar and Tanzania, all located in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 75% of the world\u2019s population with no access electricity. Qotto says its revenue has grown 50% year on year, and that it had 11,000 active customers by the end of last year, which it plans to more than double by the close of this year following its growth plans. .","filter_flag":1}

This attitude is best expressed in the name of its sustainability strategy: \u201cForever Better.\u201d PUMA made sustainability an important part of its strategy when it introduced its first Code of Conduct in 1993. A lot has changed since then. Today, more than ever before, consumers and retailers expect companies to be a part of the solution to the world\u2019s environmental challenges and ask for more sustainable product initiatives and ways to decouple consumption from carbon emissions. PUMA knows that it cannot become more sustainable by only focusing on a few individual collections, but it has to make an impact at scale. To achieve this, PUMA has set goals across 10 target areas such as climate change, circularity and plastics, which it aims to meet by 2025. As a member of the Fashion Charter for Climate Action, PUMA wants to reduce its CO2 emissions by what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Here the company recently announced some important results. Between 2017 and 2021, PUMA reduced its own carbon emissions worldwide (from offices, stores and warehouses) by 88% by buying renewable energy or renewable energy certificates and by moving its car fleet to engines without tailpipe emissions. In Los Angeles, PUMA introduced its first electric trucks to shift goods from the port to its warehouse in Torrance, California. Despite its strong growth between 2017 and 2021, PUMA also managed to reduce the carbon emissions coming from its supply chain. The company achieved this by helping its suppliers source more renewable energy and by using more sustainable, and therefore less carbon intensive, materials. The use of such materials is crucial to make more sustainable choices at scale. In 2021, PUMA expanded the use of recycled polyester to 55% in its Apparel products, as part of its strategy to use 75% recycled polyester in its Apparel and Accessories by 2025. It is also on track to remove plastic shopping bags from all of its stores this year. By 2025, PUMA aims to have more sustainable components in 90% of its footwear. This includes developing recycled options for leather, rubber and polyurethane. The first repurposed leather materials were already introduced in PUMA\u2019s RE:Gen collection in 2021. But sustainability is not only about the production of new items. With the RE:SUEDE and RE:JERSEY projects, PUMA has also started two crucial experiments to explore ways to take more responsibility for the afterlife of its products. With RE:SUEDE, PUMA made an experimental version of its classic SUEDE sneaker with special materials such as biodegradable TPE and chromium-free leather. The RE:SUEDEs were distributed to 500 volunteers in Germany, who wore them for six months before returning them to PUMA. The company will now establish with a recycling partner, whether the RE:SUEDE can biodegrade in a controlled industrial setting. With RE:JERSEY, PUMA trialed a chemical recycling process to turn old polyester jerseys into new products. With this process, PUMA can filter out colors and other impurities to create a recycled polyester yarn with the same performance characteristics as virgin polyester. PUMA plans to scale up chemical recycling in the coming years. In September 2022, PUMA hosted its first \u201cConference of the People.\u201d At this event in London, PUMA invited industry peers, experts and NGOs to meet with representatives of Gen Z to discuss some of the fashion industry\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges such as waste, materials and climate change. Because of all of these efforts, PUMA was named the most sustainable brand in the industry according to Business of Fashion, which ranked the 30 largest companies in the fashion business. PUMA is proud of the progress it has made with regards to sustainability over the past decades. However, the company is also well aware that much remains to be done to become even more sustainable and to be \u201cForever Better.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

For instance, circular design is now top of mind at IT giant Cisco as the organisation scrutinises everything from sourcing materials and shipping methods to the use of plastic and extended life cycles. The company is not only asking its employees to think more sustainably, but is also asking customers to join its efforts. \u201cFrankly, a circular economy is important not just to Cisco, but to our customers,\u201d says Scott Herren, Cisco\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cSo even though we\u2019re dealing with a number of crises, as corporate citizens, we think it\u2019s also really important to focus a lot of effort on being a circular economy leader.\u201d ","filter_flag":1}

Chocolate companies, however, have been diversifying their products and are also aiming to stay up to date with their sustainability and improvement goals. Market data According to Chicago-based market research firm IRI\u2019s data from the past 52 weeks, which ended on January 1, the chocolate candy category brought in $18.1 billion, with an increase of 9.1% from the same time period during 2022. The \u201cchocolate candy box\/bag\/bar over 3.5-oz.\u201d category brought in $7.1 billion of that, with a 9.9% increase in sales, and the same category with products less than 3.5 ounces brought in $5.3 billion, with a 7.5% increase in sales. Snack-sized chocolate candy brought in $1.29 billion, with a 10.8% increase. Diving deeper, in the \u201cchocolate candy box\/bag\/bar over 3.5-oz.\u201d category, Hershey took the lead, with $2.82 billion in sales and a 12.7% uptick from last year. Mars Wrigley brought in $1.973 billion, with a 4.4% increase, and Lindt & Sprungli brought in $532 million, with a 13.5% increase. In the under 3.5 ounces category, Hershey and Mars Wrigley again took first and second, with sales of $2.4 billion and $1.78 billion respectively, and a change of 2.8% and 10.8% respectively. Ferrero Ardennes took third, with $326 million in sales and an 11.7% increase. In the snack size category, Hershey and Mars Wrigley again dominated, with $748 million and $395 million in sales, respectively, and changes of 13.2% and 3.9%. Ferrero USA took third, with $152 billion in sales and a 19.1% increase from last year. New products The Hershey Company says that its recent new products include Reese\u2019s Big Cup Stuffed with Reese\u2019s Puffs Cereal, Reese\u2019s Dipped Animal Crackers, and Reese\u2019s Popcorn. In addition, the company launched Kit Kit Blueberry Muffin flavor as a limited offering last summer. \u201cAdditionally, we brought back former fan-favorite Kit Kat Birthday Cake in November as a permanent offering in our portfolio. Hershey also launched new seasonal offerings including Kit Kat Breaking Bones during the Halloween season and Hershey's Kisses Chocolate Dipped Strawberry for Valentine\u2019s Day. As a snacking [company], Hershey\u2019s broad portfolio ranges from indulgent to better-for-you across sweet, salty, and a combination of sweet & salty,\u201d the brand finishes. Timothy Moley, founder and CEO, Chocolove, Boulder, CO, says that Chocolove recently relaunched its mini-bar line in new flow wrappers to promote food safety and quality. \u201cThe mini-bar line relaunch is still in a series of steps toward the final iteration. Additionally, Master Chocolatier Patrick Peeters and I have been having fun in the gourmet super-premium side of our business, and we recently launched what we consider to be the world\u2019s best-tasting Hazelnut Cocoa Spread,\u201d he adds. Miguel Zorrilla, vice president of the Kinder Joy brand, Parsippany, NJ, says that the brand\u2019s latest offering is its NBA collection, which features 12 unique NBA mascot toys to connect one generation of fans to the next. The collection officially rolled out this month. Zorrilla says that Kinder Joy is constantly innovating\u2014whether expanding ways to play or leaning into a variety of consumption moments\u2014to meet the ever-changing interests of consumers. \u201cWe do this by developing new toy collections with brands that foster family connections and ignite imagination, such as the Avatar toy collection and the NBA collection. We also do this by creating new ways to lean into seasonal moments when families come together to celebrate; for example, our new Birthday pack,\u201d he says. Troy Pearley, EVP, general manager, North America, Divine Chocolate, Washington, D.C., says that in January 2022, Divine launched two new Superfruits bars in milk and dark chocolate in the U.S. \u201cInspired by the \u2018better-for-you\u2019 ingredients trend, Divine created these bars to include blackcurrants, cranberries, and elderberries, which are known for their antioxidants. The combination of these berries and warm vanilla delivers a harmonious experience for both milk and dark chocolate lovers. Divine\u2019s creamy milk chocolate balances the sourness of these berries while its dark chocolate offsets the sourness, offering a softer taste experience,\u201d Pearley notes. Marcela Jaramillo, vice president of marketing, B4B chocolate manufacturer, Luker Chocolate says that in the past year, the brand has introduced a host of new products into its Balance portfolio. \u201cThis line provides brands with couvertures that appeal to conscious consumers wanting better-for-you products, without sacrificing on taste. Notably, we launched our No Added Sugar Oat M!lk 43% couverture in January, which offers a creamy plant-based option sweetened with a blend of Erythritol and Stevia.\u201d Mars Wrigley (Newark, NJ) also launched many new products over the past year. Mike Gilroy, vice president of trade development and sponsorships, says that the company is \u201cobsessed with our consumers and constantly in touch with them to understand what they\u2019re looking for from us.\u201d Across the company\u2019s Treats & Snacks portfolio, it has strategically rolled out research-backed products that meet consumer demands, he says. Within the past year, it has launched: M&M\u2019S Caramel Cold Brew \u2013 Tapping into the booming cold brew coffee scene and pairing it with one of its fan-favorite products, M&M\u2019S Caramel Cold Brew delivers a combination of coffee flavor and sweet caramel, covered in M&M\u2019S milk chocolate and wrapped in a candy shell. M&M\u2019S Caramel Cold Brew will start rolling out at retail across the U.S. this spring. M&M\u2019S Flipping The Status Quo Packs \u2013 To celebrate women who are flipping the status quo, M&M\u2019S released its first-ever packs spotlighting dynamic female M&M'S characters this past January. The limited-edition product features Purple, Brown, and Green on inspirational packaging, and is the first united representation of the female trio spokescandies. These debut M&M'S packs come as the next chapter for Mars' newest M&M'S character, Purple, featuring her not only on packaging but inside packaging as well, alongside green and brown candies. M&M\u2019S Flipping The Status Quo Packs are currently available in retailers nationally. Snickers Hi Protein \u2013 Stepping into the performance nutrition space, Snickers Hi Protein bars feature the same chocolate, caramel, and peanut ingredients associated with Snickers but are now packed with twenty grams of protein. Snickers Hi Protein is currently available at select retailers with nationwide distribution later this year. Norman Love, CEO and founder, Norman Love Confections, Fort Myers, FL, says that the brand has five new products it introduced over the past year. They include: Advent calendars \u2013 a new 24-piece Advent Calendar was introduced for the holidays in 2022. Hot Chocolate Bombs \u2013 seasonal and several additional flavors including a Valentine\u2019s Day chocolate bomb. Latin-influenced line to be introduced this spring. Five-layer cake Specialty boxes Sustainability initiatives Gilroy says that sustainability continues to be high on the agenda, for both leaders across the confectionery industry and Mars\u2019s consumers, who are seeking products with reduced packaging and more opportunities to recycle. \u201cAt Mars, since launching our multi-billion-dollar Sustainable in a Generation Plan in 2017, we are transforming how we do business across our confectionery, food, and pet segments by making changes in three key areas: Healthy Planet, Thriving People, and Nourishing Wellbeing,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve set a science-based climate target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain by 2050 and plan to achieve this by doing things like transitioning to 100% renewable energy, redesigning our supply chains, and scaling up initiatives in sustainable and regenerative agriculture,\u201d Gilroy continues. \u201cWhile packaging is a key focus across our segments, within Mars, this is one area where we\u2019re doubling down and working hard on packaging innovations. In 2021, we announced that we were eliminating the traditional plastic overlap from our M&M\u2019S Theater Boxes, making the packaging fully recyclable\u2014an adjustment that will remove 98 metric tons of plastic waste a year,\u201d he expands. \u201cIn 2022, together with Berry Global, we announced the launch of our pantry-sized M&M\u2019S in polyethylene terephthalate jars that have been optimized to be lighter weight and include 15% post-consumer resin. The jars will eliminate approximately 300 tons of virgin plastic per year. And, on a global level, we announced that over 220 million Mars bars sold in the UK, Ireland, and Canada will be certified as carbon neutral by 2023,\u201d Gilroy finishes. Madison Lindsay, associate marketing manager, Niagara Chocolates, Buffalo, NY, says that the brand sees sustainability as a major theme in the industry. \u201cIt is a core value of our parent company, Migros, and is in our DNA. Our understanding of sustainability is based on the three-pillar model: environment, society, and economy. Our long-term economic success is based on the equal weighting of social, ecological, and economic aspects while respecting and complying with environmentally relevant and social values,\u201d she shares. \u201cLooking at the consumer, the data shows millennial and Gen Z consumers are expecting brands to make more product claims than previous generations demanded and sustainability is certainly at the top of the list. For Gen-Z especially, seeing a brand that engages in sustainable practices establishes a set of shared values that gives a sense of relatability and comfort,\u201d Lindsay adds. Jaramillo says that the chocolate industry worldwide has a complex relationship with sustainability. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that sustainability initiatives shouldn\u2019t be one-size-fits-all; each farmer, region, and country has unique challenges that demand unique solutions. Blanket approaches simply don\u2019t work, so we must work closely with each farmer to understand their individual needs, taking a grassroots approach to sustainable development,\u201d he comments. \u201cBy tackling local needs first\u2014from equitable pay and access to sustainable farming techniques\u2014we have built a solid foundation of trust and understanding, from which we can enhance ethical cocoa production in Colombia. Through our collaborative sustainability model, The Chocolate Dream, we drive positive results across farmer income, environmental protection, and social impact. If we continue to listen to farmers and take a hyper-local approach, we can identify new challenges sooner and act faster for the protection of the planet and of cocoa-growing economies worldwide,\u201d Jaramillo suggests. \u201cWellness remains a core focus of our R&D team. With challenger brands looking to address the needs of the conscious consumer, we are working with our clients to produce products right for their audiences. In 2023, we remain committed to innovation, developing better-for-you products that taste great and are kinder to the body,\u201d he says. \u201cTrue to our values, we are on track for our 2030 Net Zero goal, having joined the UN Race to Zero campaign. Our progress is encouraging, having achieved 100% carbon neutrality across both scopes 1 and 2 since 2021. Most recently, we launched \u2018Project Sunflower,\u2019 in which we installed solar panels on the roof of our production plant in Bogota\u2014the first step in using clean energy to produce our chocolate. The project will reduce our carbon footprint by 161 tons per annum and save energy usage by 275,000 kWh per year,\u201d Jaramillo adds. \u201cWe are also excited to share that we are in the process of becoming BCorp accredited, joining the ranks of incredible businesses taking action on sustainability and ethical leadership,\u201d he elaborates. Hershey\u2019s purpose is to \u201cMake More Moments of Goodness\u201d for its consumers for many generations to come, says the company. \u201cIntegral to achieving that is our holistic sustainability strategy: our Shared Goodness Promise. This promise guides how we empower the people who make and sell our brands; interact with farming communities that grow our ingredients; deliver on our commitments to consumers, customers, and external stakeholders; and protect the environment and support children and youth,\u201d the brand shares. \u201cWe are making significant strides across our most important environmental, social, and governance priorities\u2014cocoa sustainability; responsibly sourcing our ingredients; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and our environmental agenda, which are detailed in our latest ESG report,\u201d the brand says. Moley says that the cocoa industry overall is making positive strides toward sustaining the livelihood of cocoa farmers. \u201cI think that\u2019s in part because every chocolate company has a vested interest in seeing the cocoa farmer succeed. Each company has a different approach to supporting farmers, but that variety is good. The perennial matter of how to help someone both in the manner they want to be helped, and in a way that is lasting, still remains,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe industry tends to look at the word sustainability from a very practical standpoint, as sustaining the cocoa farmer is indeed sustaining the cocoa industry\u2014we are very aware that we are all in this together. The feelings of humanity are also evident; we want to see cocoa farmers not only sustained but thriving,\u201d Moley adds. Packaging, ecommerce challenges Love says that his company has experienced cost increases due to freight\/shipping, and packaging challenges because of paper and material shortages. In addition, demand is increasing nationwide for ultra-premium, artisanal chocolates. \u201cNorman Love Chocolates (NLC) made substantial improvements to [our] ecommerce platform because that division of the business continues to surge. Ecommerce has been one of NLC\u2019s most favorable revenue streams and continues to show the highest rate of growth,\u201d he says. Love doesn\u2019t expect e-commerce to slow in the foreseeable future, so plans on continuing to focus on that aspect of sales. Areas of focus for e-commerce for NLC include the technology\/ecommerce platform; visuals and creative (eye-appealing); and social media. As far as trends go, Moley says Chocolove\u2019s consumer trend line is toward consuming more chocolate on a daily use occasion as compared to a seasonal use occasion. \u201cThe other trend line is as daily use increases, so too do consumer sophistication and taste, as well as a willingness to pay more for better quality chocolate. I am pleased to see more companies move toward alternative packaging with the industry exploring recyclable, compostable, and bio-packaging. Again, the beauty of this diverse industry is the variety of approaches being taken. While some approaches better meet consumer needs, it is good to see so many firms trying and pushing this trend forward,\u201d he notes. For ecommerce, the company has a novel product in development specifically for that arena that it imagines will be \u201cinteresting and amusing.\u201d \u201cOther than that, we follow a more traditional approach to ecommerce, using the same techniques and practices many chocolate firms follow these days,\u201d elaborates Moley. Hershey says that as consumer needs change and shopper behavior evolves, it\u2019s the company\u2019s job to meet them where they are. \u201cSince the height of the pandemic, consumers have been finding new ways to enjoy time at home and continue to do so as their routines evolve. They are doing more of what brings them joy\u2014particularly spending time with family and enjoying home-centric activities like game or movie night and embracing snacking as part of self-care and affordable indulgence,\u201d the company says. \u201cWe also continue to see snacking occasions\/frequency increase throughout the day. While this trend was emerging prior to the pandemic, it has continued to accelerate as consumer mobility increases and diverges from three main meals to various snacks throughout the day,\u201d says Hershey. Through packaging innovation, Hershey strives to help its retail partners give consumers access to their favorite treats in a variety of sizes. \u201cWe have seen an increase in sharing occasions across snacking, which is driving sales across larger pack sizes. Whether it\u2019s more summer road trips or get-togethers with families and friends, consumers are sharing more of the snacks they love,\u201d the company adds. For ecommerce, the consumer's shopper journey is not offline or online, it\u2019s interwoven, suggests Hershey. \u201cConsumers continue to demand a seamless digital experience to bring it all together via mobile ordering, curbside pickup, and customized loyalty programs. Hershey has digitally met shoppers when they\u2019re in the physical store space too. When shoppers pick up their click-and-collect groceries, digital promotions can help drive additional purchases if consumers still go in-store for items not included in their digital order,\u201d the company adds. \u201cInnovation remains an important part of our model, and we have several items we are launching this year that we believe will generate consumer engagement and strong merchandising in-store. Look for more variations of favorite treats and expanded flavor profiles in the coming months,\u201d Hershey finishes. Jennifer Peterson, brand director, Fannie May Chocolates, Chicago, says that Fannie May has concentrated its marketing efforts first in the Midwest region, where its presence is better known, and then expanded to incremental markets that have historically high premium chocolate demand. \u201cWith our recently launched Direct-To-Consumer platform, people across the nation who miss being near a Fannie May store can enjoy their favorites, and we\u2019re able to reach new fans,\u201d Peterson says. As to consumer trends, premiumization is a long-term trend within confection and many other categories as American consumers insist on elevated experiences, affordable luxuries, and truly unique gifts, she shares. Pearley says chocolate consumers are also becoming more mindful of what they put into their bodies, seeking out natural, \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d ingredients. \u201cNewer ethical brands, like Lily\u2019s and Hu, are grabbing consumer attention by not including sugar or artificial flavors. Divine Chocolate is made with Fairtrade cocoa and sugar, pure cocoa butter, and natural ingredients, and does not use artificial flavors, palm oil, or soy,\u201d he explains. Most of the large chocolate brands make claims in their branding and packaging that they are ethical, but use their own set of standards rather than a reputable third party, Pearley notes. \u201cFor consumers that care about transparency in supply chains and the fair treatment of cocoa farmers, they should look for certifications like Fairtrade and B Corp.,\u201d he suggests. On the ecommerce side, Divine launched sales on Amazon in the U.S. in October 2021 and will be revising its American webshop in the near future to provide consumers with a better shopping experience. Jaramillo agrees that the \u201cconscious consumer remains a key audience for innovative chocolate brands in 2023.\u201d According to Innova Market Insights\u2019 2022 report, 41% of consumers believe developing new food products should be driven by health and wellness. \u201cLike all chocolate buyers, these conscious consumers want a tasty and indulgent treat. But they are also looking for products that align with their approach to holistic well-being. For chocolate, this may be in the form of products with reduced sugar or plant-based ingredients, to name just a few,\u201d Jaramillo predicts. On the flip side, Lindsay says that although Niagara Chocolates is seeing trends in the industry towards \u201cbetter-for-you,\u201d \u201clow-sugar,\" etc., the company\u2019s research shows that the majority of consumers still come to the chocolate aisle to treat themselves to an indulgent experience. \u201cWhile we offer simple, natural ingredients with our Niagara Chocolates brand, we are always sure to deliver indulgence in our small-batch recipes. Very related to this is the theme of nostalgia\u2014especially during the holiday season we see consumers gravitating towards familiar classic flavors such as gingerbread and sugar cookie,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are noted by the flavor experts at the Kerry Flavor Institute and we have built them into our holiday 2022 and 2023 lines. Gingerbread was our #1 seller on ecommerce\u2014consumers went nuts and it sold out in 8 days!\u201d Lindsay shares. The company is continuing to make ecommerce a focus of its business. Amazon and its own site are major components, but it is seeing more and more an omnichannel approach from retailers, notes Lindsay. \u201cIt is a key part of our strategy to partner with our brick-and-mortar customers to ensure our products are available on their ecommerce sites and we have robust product listings with SEO descriptions and good content to support,\u201d she comments. Gilroy says that aligning legacy brands with current trends is key to winning, and as Gen Z continues to gain buying power, Mars is looking at generational trends to make sure it\u2019s staying relevant and bringing in new users while also satisfying existing ones. \u201cM&M\u2019S is a great example of this. The brand is iconic, but to make it legendary we need to keep fans engaged and make it relevant for Gen Z to ensure consumers keep coming back. In 2022 alone we launched a new M&M\u2019S brand visual identity and brand purpose focused on creating a world where everyone feels they belong,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cWe partnered with trailblazing artists on custom collaborations, and of course, introduced the first new character in over ten years, Purple\u2014all of which helped cement the M&M\u2019S brand on Morning Consult\u2019s list of Gen Z\u2019s favorite brands for 2022,\u201d Gilroy adds. For ecommerce, Mars is always evaluating how it can best leverage its portfolio in creative and engaging ways that always seek to put the consumer at the heart of everything we do, he says. \u201cWhile there\u2019s been explosive growth in e-commerce as shoppers are increasingly choosing different methods of shopping for speed and convenience, consumer behaviors continue to show that shoppers are craving one-on-one connections with brands. Across our brands, we\u2019re focused on creating connected and immersive shopping experiences for our customers\u2014both online and in retail,\u201d Gilroy elaborates. \u201cWe support our wholesale and retail partners with creative 360 media campaigns to amplify the experience in-store, and we help our retail partners activate against brand campaigns and key moments with a range of display vehicles and promotional support, including digital activations, to capture and maximize on the impulse nature of the confectionery category,\u201d he finishes. Upcoming products Gilroy says that, in response to consumer demand, Snickers recently announced the return of a fan-favorite flavor, Snickers Rockin\u2019 Nut Road. \u201cSnickers Rockin\u2019 Nut Road is packed with roasted almonds and marshmallow-flavored nougat all covered in rich dark chocolate. These ingredients are combined with the same classic silky caramel in original Snickers that fans know and love, delivering a satisfying snacking experience,\u201d he shares. Lindsay says Niagara Chocolates has a new launch shipping on April 1 called \u201cCrafter\u2019s Caf\u00e9,\u201d which is its take on a hipster coffee shop brought to life in chocolate\u2014for example, bagged chocolates in flavors like Churros and Hot Chocolate or Jasmine Vanilla Matcha, and chocolate bars in flavors like Strawberry Donut and Honey Almond Cold Brew. \u201cWe know that coffee is a top 10 inclusion in premium chocolate, but we are confident that no one has approached it like this before, and we want to surprise and delight consumers with our take on a coffee shop,\u201d she comments. Pearley says that this October, Divine Chocolate turns 25, and plans are underway to celebrate this huge milestone. \u201cIn 1998, Divine was established by Kuapa Kokoo, the world\u2019s largest Fairtrade cocoa cooperative, and several NGOs. Today, Kuapa still owns Divine, has 40% representation on Divine\u2019s board of directors, and receives 2% of Divine\u2019s sales to invest in farmer-led community programs,\u201d he notes. Divine is launching new products for the American market with its Christmas range, including pouches filled with dark and milk chocolate minis and two limited-edition peppermint bars in white and dark chocolate, Pearley says. \u201cDivine continues to expand its distribution in the U.S., gaining shelf placement in Dollar General nationally and select Target stores in September 2022. [In addition,] Divine continues to engage with other national retailers and large regional grocery chains to increase its availability to consumers,\u201d he adds. Moley says Chocolove will have a couple of new products and a product line to launch in 2023 that are worth watching for, though he prefers to talk about them when the company is ready to show them. \u201cWhat I can say is that we will continue to play in the gourmet and super-premium side of our business, with a focus on making the best possible chocolate that we can,\u201d he shares.","filter_flag":1}

As technology advances and more electronics enter the market, e-waste becomes an ever-growing problem. Fortunately, engineers can use sustainable manufacturing strategies to reduce or even eliminate e-waste. Sustainable manufacturing techniques focus on reducing waste while maximizing resources\u2014a win-win situation that benefits our planet and business bottom lines. Following are some of the best strategies for doing just that. From streamlined design processes to smarter product life cycles, there are plenty of ways engineers can help prevent electronic waste from entering landfills\u2014and start making a real difference in their communities today. Streamline design & manufacturing processes Eliminating e-waste is a priority for engineers who are conscious of the environment's health. By streamlining the design and manufacturing processes, engineers can drastically reduce the amount of e-waste generated yearly. To begin, engineers should focus on designing more efficient and longer-lasting electronics, as this will help reduce the amount of electronic waste due to obsolescence. Furthermore, they should look at ways to make products easier to disassemble and recycle. This approach could involve making products from modular parts that can be reused or recycled separately. Additionally, engineers should strive to make their products more energy-efficient so that consumers are not tempted to replace old models with new ones just to have a more energy-efficient device. Use renewable energy sources Regarding manufacturing processes, engineers can promote sustainable practices by using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power in their factories. They should also consider reducing water consumption in production and look for other sustainable alternatives to materials like plastics which have negative environmental impacts when disposed of improperly. Furthermore, engineers should consider using lean manufacturing techniques to reduce waste during production, such as automating processes where possible or optimizing supply chain management systems. Ensure proper electronic waste disposal Finally, engineers must ensure proper electronic waste disposal once it has reached its end-of-life stage. This could involve implementing policies encouraging companies to take responsibility for their e-waste rather than simply disposing waste in landfills or incinerators without considering any environmental impact. Additionally, they could look into improving e-waste recycling systems so that all types of electronic waste can be properly separated and treated environmentally friendly before being disposed of safely. By doing these simple steps, engineers can help create a much cleaner environment that will benefit nature and help us move closer to a circular economy. Adopt environmentally-friendly packaging Engineers have the power to help reduce electronic waste in several ways. One is to encourage manufacturers and suppliers to adopt environmentally friendly packaging solutions. By consciously choosing sustainable packaging materials, businesses can significantly reduce their contribution to the world's e-waste problem. One way that engineers can help is by advocating for better product design. For example, many digital devices are packaged with components that may not be necessary - or could be replaced with less wasteful alternatives - such as plastic wrappers and unnecessary cords. Reuse old products Additionally, engineers can promote strategies for reusing old products rather than sending them directly to landfills. This could include offering incentives for customers to return their used electronics for repair or trade-in programs. Engineers can also recommend creative ways of repurposing old technology into new products - such as turning an outdated smartphone into a home security monitoring system or reusing printer cartridges instead of buying new ones every time they run out of ink. Develop a more transparent supply chain Finally, engineers can offers advice on how manufacturers and suppliers can develop a more transparent supply chain process, where they can track exactly how much material is being used in the production of their products, as well as how long each device lasts before it needs replacing or updating. Challenges facing engineers with sustainable manufacturing One of the most significant challenges engineers face today when utilizing sustainable manufacturing strategies is finding ways to reduce environmental impacts. Engineers must be creative in problem-solving and develop new techniques for reducing carbon emissions, waste, and other pollutants. For example, many manufacturers have switched to using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, instead of traditional nonrenewable sources. However, this presents additional challenges for engineers as there is often not enough reliable or affordable renewable energy available to meet production demands. Increasing efficiency Another challenge engineers face when leveraging sustainable strategies is increasing efficiency while still producing quality products. Many manufacturing operations use outdated systems that consume more resources than necessary and can result in higher costs or less efficient production cycles. Improving existing infrastructure with newer technology can be expensive and time-consuming. However, it can ultimately lead to more efficient operations that consume fewer resources while still providing a high-quality product. Meeting consumer demand A third issue faced by engineers utilizing sustainable practices is meeting consumer demand in an environmentally responsible manner. Sustainability initiatives often involve changing the composition of products or materials used in production, making them harder to produce at scale or driving up consumer costs. To combat this issue, manufacturers must create products that meet consumer expectations while remaining compliant with sustainability standards\u2014a difficult balance to maintain. Additionally, companies must be willing to invest in education and research into green technologies to stay competitive in the market and create better consumer experiences with renewable materials or improved processes like zero-waste packaging. Investing in sustainable initiatives Finally, engineers face the challenge of convincing executives and stakeholders to invest in sustainable initiatives. Many executives may view sustainability as a costly endeavor that does not equate to immediate profits; however, they must recognize the long-term benefits these investments can bring, such as lower costs due to reduced resource consumption or improved brand reputation due to increased consumer trust in their commitment towards sustainability goals. Additionally, governments should be incentivizing companies through incentives such as tax credits which will help offset some of the costs associated with greening operations while encouraging others within their industries to follow suit. In sum, sustainable manufacturing strategies can be a powerful tool for engineers looking to reduce environmental impacts and move their companies towards more meaningful sustainability goals. Despite their challenges, engineers are key players in helping create a more sustainable world and should be supported and encouraged to take on greening operations.

Recently, knowledge has increased about the negative impact of plastics on climate change, air pollution and human health. New pathways for plastics production and consumption are needed to increase circularity and sustainability in Europe and beyond. The three pathways discussed in this briefing are smarter use, increased circularity and renewable materials, for which good practice examples are found across Europe (EEA, 2020). This briefing provides an overview of good practice examples of these pathways, including from policymakers, business and citizens. There is no \u2018one solution fits all\u2019 for circular and sustainable plastics. The examples provide inspiration, are scalable and can therefore help to build the foundations of an increasingly circular and sustainable plastics economy. This briefing is underpinned by a more detailed report prepared by the European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use (ETC\/CE). Figure 1 shows how the good practice examples found for the three pathways address various life cycle steps and contribute to reduced environmental impacts. Figure 1. Pathways towards sustainable and circular plastics Source: Developed by the EEA and the ETC\/CE \u2014 illustration by the Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) and the EEA. The smarter use of plastics pathway An important step towards increasing the sustainability and circularity of plastics is to consider and rethink when and why plastics are used. In Europe and worldwide, there is a need to reduce the use of unnecessary plastics, redesign plastic-containing products and extend the lifetime of plastic products already in use. This includes repairing plastic-containing products more often. The relatively low price of plastics, as well as the current design of most plastic-containing products, does not naturally encourage longer use, repair, reuse or sharing. Therefore, it is important to increase motivation to take action and scale up existing good practice examples, including those reducing the need for plastics or improving reuse systems (OECD, 2022). The approaches used in these good practice examples may not always be more convenient, but they will be necessary in the transition to a more circular and sustainable use of plastics. Figure 2 illustrates the smarter use of plastics pathway and the good practice examples found, which involve production and use. As shown, business, policymakers and citizens are key to implementing and scaling up the approaches taken in the good practice examples to achieve the goals of the pathway. Figure 2. The smarter use of plastics pathway Note: The life cycle steps highlighted in blue are the ones most relevant for the smarter use pathway, but are not necessarily the only ones that can be found. Source: Developed by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use (ETC\/CE) \u2014 illustration by the Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) and the EEA. Good practice examples of the smarter use of plastics most often relate to new business models enabling moving from owning products to accessing services, sharing between citizens, and using less plastic packaging. These are discussed below. New, sustainable and circular business models Access-based circular business models enable consumers to access goods and services that meet their needs without requiring them to own the product itself. These business models have the potential to reduce the production of new products, while increasing the intensity and efficiency of existing products through shared use and reuse. One good example of an access-based business model is renting out reusable cups, cans, cutlery, etc., for different events and using these items in restaurants, instead of providing single-use products. This is seen in France, where all disposable packaging in fast-food restaurants has recently been banned (Chrisafis, 2022). The EU Single-Use Plastics (SUP) Directive aims to ban or reduce the use of 10 types of plastics products that are used only once and often for a short time before they are thrown away and to promote the use of more sustainable alternatives (EU, 2019). Another example is renting out good-quality festival gear, including sleeping mats, tents and pavilions, thereby limiting the purchasing of cheap, poor-quality gear, which is often left behind. A third example is leasing personal electronic products containing plastics, including headphones, printers and washing machines, to reduce the number of new products purchased. All of the above are good practice examples of approaches that, if implemented on a large scale, can reduce the production of new products and increase the intensity and efficiency of use of products containing plastics, decreasing their overall environmental and climate impacts. Sharing between citizens Sharing between citizens is another increasing trend within plastics; instead of purchasing products containing plastics, citizens can share or rent these directly or through common platforms such as libraries. Good practice examples here encourage more circular habits by ensuring that many citizens use the same products again and again. Key to the success and scaling of this scheme is efficient redistribution and accessibility, while at the same time ensuring that sharing services enable consumers to save money (Kimberley, 2020). An example of sharing plastic-containing products is citizens renting their cars (often electric cars) to others when they do not need them (as an alternative to more traditional car rental services). Another example is sharing tools and equipment, for example in Finland, where public libraries offer a wide range of products, such as sewing machines, musical instruments and energy meters. A third example is baby equipment, including toys, strollers, highchairs, car seats and similar, which often are used for a short time, compared to the lifetime of the products. Renting and leasing services for these products are becoming more popular, as is reselling between private consumers through apps, webpages and other platforms. Reusing plastic packaging Using plastics in a smarter way also means avoiding unnecessary use of plastics, including by reusing plastic packaging. In 2021, the EU Plastics Own Resource initiative was implemented, which encourages Member States to reduce packaging waste by putting a uniform call rate on non-recycled plastic packaging waste. One example of smarter plastic packaging use is the business-to-business (B2B) reuse of packaging in the food sector. By standardising plastic crates and pallets and making them good quality, it is possible to create a closed loop, whereby a deposit scheme enables the packaging to be returned. Another example is consumers bringing their own reusable containers to shops and refilling them with various products from bulk (such as nuts, cereals and shampoo). Well-designed refill\/reuse systems can successfully save materials, but more radical approaches such as packaging-free shops have not been very successful on a large scale. The increased circularity of plastics pathway Increasing the circularity of plastics and closing the materials loop, including through higher resource efficiency and lower material (and value) losses, are important for maintaining the value and utility of plastics. A major issue is the (quantity and) quality of recycled materials on the market at present, as only a fraction of these recyclates can be used in high-value products. Therefore, most of the recycled materials are part of downcycling processes. Many plastics contain additives that might hinder the recycling process by contaminating the resulting recyclates. Uncertainty about the composition of waste material often leads to disposal by incineration, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Figure 3 illustrates good practice examples for the increased circularity of plastics across the life cycle. Business, policymakers and citizens are key to implementing the approaches taken in these good practice examples to achieve the goals of the pathway. Figure 3. The increased circularity of plastics pathway Note: The life cycle steps highlighted in green are the ones most relevant for the increased circularity of plastics pathway, but are not necessarily the only ones that can be found. Source: Developed by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use (ETC\/CE) \u2014 illustration by the Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) and the EEA. Good practice examples for the increased circularity pathway are often related to the increased collection, sorting and recycling of plastics achieved through business, policymaker and citizen initiatives. These are discussed below. Increased collection and sorting of plastic Increasing the collection, sorting and recycling of plastics after use is essential for meeting the goals for better plastic waste management. Collecting and sorting plastics both reduces the amount of plastic littering and microplastics in terrestrial and marine environments and helps to secure the infrastructure needed to increase plastic recycling. In recent years, business has taken many initiatives in response to the growing focus on recycling. One example is businesses offering take-back services for their own products at the end of a product\u2019s life, thereby enabling the qualitative recycling and sometimes reuse of these products. This ensures that companies have full traceability of materials and components. In other cases, businesses collaborate with stakeholders to develop separate collection and recycling schemes for a given product category, making it easier for consumers to hand back their used products. For all consumer products, the role of citizens is key to closing the material loops, be it through contributing to proper collection and separation of waste or choosing products with high recycled content during purchasing, thereby encouraging manufacturers to use more recycled content in their products. Connecting recycling and recycled materials markets Policymakers have a very important role to play in the continued development of policy initiatives that contribute to designing better products for reuse and recycling, increasing the collection rate of plastic waste, and further developing sorting and recycling technology, as well as providing well-developed markets for secondary materials. An important tool that policymakers have to support the circular use of plastics is setting quotas for recycled content in suitable applications, such as packaging, automotive, construction and electronics. Examples include the EU plastics strategy, the newly proposed revision of the EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive and the EU Plastics Own Resource initiative as presented above. The EU plastics strategy aims to make recycling profitable for businesses, curb plastic waste, drive innovation and investment and spur global change (EC, 2018). The revision of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive covers both packaging design and waste management and establishes EU-level packaging waste prevention measures and targets (EU, 1994). Concrete initiatives include national and regional knowledge hubs that are currently being formed. Another initiative is the Circular Plastics Alliance (CPA), which the European Commission established as part of the EU plastics strategy to boost the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes each year by 2025. The alliance covers the whole plastics value chain and comprises 311 signatories representing industry, academia, non-governmental organisations and public authorities. Yet another initiative is the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s initiative on a circular economy for plastics, which proposes to eliminate waste and innovate circularity of plastics (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2023). A further example is the various extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, which can promote product design for circularity, the collection of end-of-life products and circular recycling to high-value materials that promotes the use of eco-modulated fees that favour recyclable (and sustainable) products. The renewable material pathway The renewable material pathway for plastics focuses on promoting renewable feedstock-based solutions, such as biobased plastics, which support the decoupling from fossil-based feedstocks. This pathway focuses on the beginning of the value chain, on feedstock choices and on feedstock supply. Possible benefits of using renewable feedstocks include breaking the dependence of plastic production on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, if the feedstocks are locally and sustainably sourced, increasing rural development and also possibly reducing dependence on imported feedstocks. Biobased plastics are made from renewable materials, in contrast to conventional plastic, which is usually made from fossil-based resources (oil and gas). It is important to ensure that resource use is reduced in the first place, and that the materials of all feedstocks, including biobased feedstocks, are kept in the circular economy loop for as long as possible. This means that secondary raw materials, e.g. biowaste and by-products like used cooking oil, are preferred to primary raw materials, e.g. sugarcane and wood. Box 1. Biobased plastic is not always biodegradable In general, \u2018biobased\u2019 refers to the origin of materials and \u2018biodegradable\u2019 refers to the potential behaviour of those materials under controlled circumstances at product end of life. Thus, whether a type of plastic is biodegradable or not depends in large part on its composition and not on the source of the materials used in its production. This means that biobased plastics are not necessarily biodegradable. Non-degradable biobased plastics are conventional plastic types produced with renewable biobased materials. This type of plastic can be recycled in the same way as and mixed with plastics from fossil fuel sources. Biodegradable plastics are designed to degrade in specific mediums under specific conditions, meaning that they do not necessarily degrade in the open environment. Often, biodegradable plastics cannot be recycled together with non-biodegradable plastics. More information can be found in the EEA\u2019s briefing \u2018Biodegradable and compostable plastics \u2014 challenges and opportunities\u2019 and in the European Commission\u2019s communication on biobased, biodegradable and compostable plastics. Biodegradable plastics are recommended for only very specific uses in the European Commission\u2019s communication on biobased, biodegradable and compostable plastics and should not be seen as a solution to inappropriate waste management and littering (EC, 2022). Figure 4 illustrates good practice examples for the renewable material pathway, which involves plastics production, use and waste. Businesses and policymakers are key to implementing the approaches taken in these good practice examples to achieve the goals of the pathway. Figure 4. The renewable material for plastics pathway Note: The life cycle steps highlighted in blue are the ones most relevant for the renewable material pathway, but are not necessarily the only ones that can be found. Source: Developed by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use (ETC\/CE) \u2014 illustration by the Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) and the EEA. Good practice examples for the renewable material pathway are often seen to be related to the emerging production methods, including the development and uptake of biobased feedstocks, and new initiatives from policymakers against greenwashing, including to improve product specifications of biobased plastics. The examples are presented below. Emerging production methods Biobased plastics have the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions if they are produced responsibly and recycled rather than incinerated (ETC WMGE, 2021). The feedstocks for biobased plastics are often divided into first, second and sometimes third generation (EC, 2012). First-generation feedstocks are suitable for food and feed applications and include corn and sugarcane. Second- and third-generation feedstocks are not suitable for food or feed and include non-food crops such as cellulose and algae, by-products of food and feed production such as corn stover and waste streams such as biowaste (ETC\/CE, 2023). Second- and third-generation feedstocks are preferable, as they do not compete with food and feed production. The commercial availability of biobased plastic products is still limited, but such products include packaging, textiles and films. New initiatives against greenwashing Greenwashing is a growing problem in the transition to a circular economy. Generic claims that products include \u2018bioplastics\u2019 or \u2018biobased plastics\u2019 are often made without any specifications of amounts or sources. These claims can mislead consumers and create confusion in the market. One example of an initiative to counter this trend is a forthcoming proposal from the European Commission to limit unsubstantiated green claims and for companies to refer to only exact and measurable shares of biobased plastic content in products (EC, 2022). How to scale up good practice examples for the pathways towards a to sustainable and circular plastics system Businesses have an opportunity to influence and contribute to the development and implementation of the smarter use pathway, the increased circularity pathway and the renewable material pathway. There is high potential for investing in and scaling up circular business models. To upscale the circular ways of doing business, technical and social innovations and collaboration are needed (EEA, 2021). Businesses play a crucial role in the whole life cycle of plastics and in making this life cycle more sustainable and circular. Policymakers can affect the speed of development of the smarter use pathway, the increased circularity pathway and the renewable material pathway by providing timely and proper policy frameworks and clarity. EU policy makers can continuously develop and ensure the implementation of policies that increase the circularity and sustainability of plastics production and consumption. The UN global treaty on plastics currently being developed will hopefully contribute to making plastics more sustainable and circular globally. Citizens can play a role in the smarter use pathway and the increased circularity pathway. They can contribute by demanding more sustainable and circular products and by being willing to engage with new, circular business models. Citizens can also contribute by changing the way they use plastics by reducing unnecessary consumption and dispose of plastics including sorting and returning products and by using longer-lasting plastic products. The examples presented in this briefing are intended to inspire business, policymakers and citizens to participate and collaborate in making plastics more circular and sustainable, thereby better protecting the environment and climate from the detrimental effects of plastics production, consumption and waste management.","filter_flag":1}

Only a united commitment to source-recycled materials in place of virgin raw materials during production processes will create a stable demand for greener products, and build the planet-saving circular economy we so desperately need. How Manufacturers are Uniting to Build a Circular Economy Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, we have been locked into a linear economy that manufactures, creates waste, discards, and manufactures again. Our goal is to build a circular economy that does not produce waste. Repurposing previously used materials in new products is a key step forward to a circular economy. To build a global circular economy, manufacturers are considering recycled materials as they explore and produce products, instead of simply repurposing their own production waste. When we, as manufacturers, include recycling in both our production and our waste management, we design new products to reflect new methods of recovering components and materials from worn-out products. We close the loop by producing sustainable products, bolstering green markets, and raising awareness among consumers about the benefit of sustainable choices in purchases as well as disposal. How Manufacturing Companies are Introducing Recycled Steel into Their Processes My area of expertise is recycled steel produced with electric arc furnace technology. It happens to be an ideal material for sustainable development and a perfect example of the circular economy we call recycling. This is because steel is infinitely recyclable. Instead of dumping old appliances or automobiles into a landfill, steel products that have reached the end of their lives can go right back into the supply chain to become steel, again and again. Because of its recyclable properties, steel is a material of choice for increasing numbers of end-users, who are turning to recycled steel to help them meet their environmental design goals. Steel made with recycled ferrous scrap as its primary raw material can be used interchangeably with steel made from virgin materials for virtually all applications, such as iron ore and coking coal, for virtually all applications. To help us harvest this scrap steel, our customers recycle a wide variety of products such as end-of-life automobiles, appliances, decommissioned steel bridges and buildings, machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging. We receive and process scrap steel at numerous metal recycling locations, melt it in electric arc furnaces, and form it into new steel products. This recycled steel is showing up everywhere, serving needs in industries such as agriculture, automotive manufacturing, civil construction, distribution, energy production, and mining. In addition, steel is a crucial element in emission-reduction infrastructure projects such as solar and wind power solutions. We have honed our manufacturing process to incorporate recycled steel at a rate of 98%. Our use of recycled steel also reduces carbon emissions in several ways. Steel production using electric arc furnace technology generates a fraction of the carbon emissions per ton compared to production from virgin materials. During the process, 97% of water is reused, and 99.9% of dust is captured and recycled. In addition, we limit our CO2 emissions by sourcing and shipping scrap metal within a 500-mile radius. Globally, the steel industry must reduce current greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. With this goal in mind, we are prioritizing greater energy and operational efficiency, increasing our use of scrap, expanding our use of sustainable forestry, employing renewable energy, and investing in new technologies and open innovation. Our mission is to be carbon neutral by 2050. Manufacturers are Moving Toward a Circular Economy As the sustainable development movement continues to grow, the trend toward manufacturers using recycled materials is gaining traction. Mounting pressure from community stakeholders, government officials, shareholders, customers, and employees to source materials responsibly is compelling manufacturers to examine their processes and make eco-friendly changes. In our linear economy, industrial processes are designed around virgin materials. Because of this, using recycled materials often leads to snags in a manufacturer's value chain. However, when we take time to adjust our production processes, we find the value in using recovered materials. Finding this value boosts the widespread drive to recover materials and reduces costs. This is why we must promote up-cycling during the early design process. As manufacturers, adopting recycled materials forces us to face new challenges in maintaining our supply of materials, modifying production processes, maintaining production efficiency, and gauging consumer demand for green products. These barriers are daunting, but they all have solutions. To build a circular economy, we must transform the supply chain, redesign products, and create consumer demand for sustainable products. Though a fully circular economy may be decades in the future, each time a manufacturer introduces waste-derived, recovered, or recycled materials into their products, we take a crucial step forward.

This makes scaling up renewable power all the more critical. India is expected to add more than 350 GW of renewable power capacity (including large hydro) in this decade. This is over four times the renewable power capacity added during 2010-2020. 75% of this capacity expansion will come from variable solar and wind power. This makes it necessary to add balancing sources like energy storage systems ( ESS ) to maintain grid stability.Moreover, businesses will need ESS to fast-track decarbonization of their energy use. Most large commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers have set aggressive net-zero emissions goals, much in advance of India\u2019s target of 2070. This will require working out ways to decarbonize faster than the pace at which renewable power is being integrated into the power grid ESS help achieve greater utilization of the available capacity of the grid and renewable sources. While the need for energy storage is clear at the individual power consumer and at the national power system level, is it a commercially viable solution today? The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), in its \u2018Business guide to energy storage adoption in India\u2019 identifies the following use cases to make ESS adoption commercially viable as of today:Meeting peak load requirement: It would cost around INR 55\/kWh for a distribution utility to contract new base load thermal power to meet the peak load that occurs for around 3.5% of the time in a year, as compared to less than INR 25\/kWh in case of standalone ESS. When ESS is co-located with a hybrid solar and wind power plant, it would also be commercially attractive for meeting the peak load that occurs 25% of the time in a year.Enhancing availability of renewable power plants: Various energy storage technologies are already being commercially used by distribution utilities and C&I consumers to ensure a greater power supply from renewable sources than naturally available over a defined period of time. National-level tenders like the SECI 400 MW RTC have shown that this is achievable at a cost that is less than that of thermal power procurement.Diesel abatement: The current cost of using diesel by C&I consumers to generate power in cases of grid outage is around INR 35\/kWh, while ESS (standalone or with solar rooftop) can bring this down significantly (to INR 18\/kWh and INR 15\/kWh respectively) for locations which have 1 hour of daily grid outage.Value stacking of two or more use cases is the best bet to optimize revenue streams from the same ESS asset. This will also protect adopters in case any use case becomes redundant in the future, for instance, reduced need for power back-up with improvements in the power supply situation.The new heightened demand for energy storage to support grid balancing and stability as renewables increase rapidly requires readiness on all fronts. First, to address the lack of appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks for ESS, there is a need to put in place market-driven mechanisms like dynamic pricing of power supply by distribution utilities, introducing market-based instruments for the procurement of ancillary services and an effective carbon market.Second, most advanced energy storage technologies haven\u2019t fully achieved the required scale to be commercially viable for adoption, limiting commercial deployment to the use cases mentioned above. The announcement of a viability gap funding for battery ESS for a total capacity of 4 GWh and a to-be proposed framework for pumped hydro storage plants in the Union Budget 2023 is likely to provide an initial push to ESS deployments.There is an additional need to substantially reduce the import duty and the goods and services tax on ESS and\/or its components for ESS deployed for stationary storage applications, at least for an initial period of 2-3 years, post which it can be gradually escalated.Third, many businesses procuring low-carbon energy for their operations are overwhelmed by the variety of new energy solutions. They need to enhance their internal capabilities \u2013 both data analytics and human resources \u2013 to be able to choose the most optimal energy solutions in line with their sustainability strategy. Lack of appropriate data at the required frequency often misguides commercial decisions on new technology adoption. Additionally, it is critical that power procurement, finance and sustainability professionals continuously update themselves on the relevance and applicability of new energy technologies.The current decade will be a pivotal point for ESS adoption as the awareness, availability and reliability of these systems improve. The businesses and countries that can take the lead in this transition will come out more resilient and face better long-term growth prospects.","filter_flag":1}

Over the course of the partnership, BD claims it has increased the recycling rate of these plastic, glass, and metal material streams by an astonishing 255%. But it wants to do more, and has started a pilot program to recover and recycle BD syringes discarded by healthcare facilities. The pilot will assess the feasibility of recycling these products back into the manufacturing process, creating additional local sourcing options and alleviating pressures on the critically challenged supply-chain system, said BD. BD produces billions of syringes each year, and healthcare facilities represent a key opportunity for reclaiming these products. That is not without its challenges, however, because of the various components and steps involved in the process, including safe handling of bio-hazardous material. \u201cAs part of this pilot, we are assessing the material standards that need to be met to ensure that we can recycle these materials safely and effectively into new products,\u201d Vice President and General Manager of Injection Systems Chee Lum told PlasticsToday. \u201cThis includes treating, sterilizing, and decontaminating recovered materials before being considered for re-introduction as recycled content in medical devices.\u201d Initial results are expected in the first half of 2023. Mechanical recycling is currently used to process syringes manufactured in house, explained Lum. \u201cAs part of the pilot program, we are evaluating a variety of recycling capabilities for processing syringes discarded by healthcare facilities, including mechanical recycling and advanced chemical recycling methods as we look to scale these solutions,\u201d said Lum. \u201cThe opportunity to drive innovation around material sustainability by building a circular value chain for managing post-consumer healthcare plastics furthers our commitment to addressing and managing the most relevant environmental issues facing our business and stakeholders today,\u201d said BD in the news release. \u201cWe know work like this can make a lasting, positive impact, which is why we continue to challenge ourselves and our partners to find these opportunities to grow, improve, and do what is right. Both BD and Casella are committed to helping build systems that enable short- and long-term value and sustainability.\u201d BD has committed to creating meaningful, measurable change over the next decade, as articulated in its BD 2030+ environmental, social, and governance goals. Casella was founded in 1975 as a refuse removal business in Rutland, VT.

Solar panel maintenance is essential, because dust accumulation can degrade its performance, which can further impact the amount of power generated by the panel. A well-maintained mechanism for the operations and maintenance (O&M) of solar plants is critical to any solar power project, because it has to be undertaken throughout the plant\u2019s life. Cleaning solutions are one of the most important components of the O&M of a so\u00adlar farm. A research paper titled \u201cAn Ex\u00adperimental Study on the Effect of Dust on Po\u00adwer Loss in Solar Photovoltaic Module\u201d by Athar Hussain, Ankit Batra and Rupen\u00addra Pa\u00adchau\u00ad\u00adri has concluded that the accumulation of dust reduces the efficiency of solar modules and panels in terms of po\u00adwer by up to 60 per cent. Enough literature is available demonstrating the relation between cleanliness and the power efficiency of modules. As a result, cleaning so\u00adlar modules is a critical process to consider whenever a solar project is undertaken. The frequency and technique of module cleaning varies across project sites. Mo\u00addules located in areas with regular rainfall may only need to be cleaned once or twice a month. However, modules in areas with high levels of pollution might require frequent cleaning. It is even more difficult for solar farms located in arid and semi-arid regions, where the water scarcity pro\u00adblem is pervasive due to natural conditions. As such, the water consumption le\u00adve\u00adls for cleaning purposes at solar plants significantly add to their operating costs. Cleaning mechanisms Back when the number of panels used to be low, the majority of power plant owners relied on hiring people for manual cleaning. However, as the solar power industry ex\u00adpanded, the number of panels per plant grew significantly. Now, such plants are lo\u00adcated not only on land but on waterbodies as well. When these power plants are built on land, manual cleaning is still possible, though difficult because of the increased labour costs and the challe\u00adn\u00adges of working on big solar farms located in remote areas with varying weather conditions. Moreover, plants are now being built on even seas, making the O&M process even more difficult to perform manually. Further, it has been found that solar plants installed on waterbodies face difficulties due to the accumulation of sea salt on their surfaces. Sea salt can significantly impact a panel\u2019s power output efficiency, as it can corrode the aluminium strips us\u00aded to encase the panels. Hence, re\u00admo\u00adving sea salt from a pa\u00adnel\u2019s surface is just as important as removing dirt. Since solar power is now being deployed across vastly different geographies with different kinds of solar plant installations, different kinds of cleaning solutions have also emerged. The traditional method of removing dirt is to wash or wipe it away. Under this method, a simple cloth may be used to clean the surface of PV panels, with water. This technique involves frequ\u00adent and repetitive procedures, and can be extremely time-consuming. A second me\u00adthod is semi-automatic cleaning, which makes use of both robots and manual labour. In semi-automatic systems, robots are manually moved from one row to an\u00adother, or from one table to another. These systems are best suited for solar panels installed on uneven ground, as well as those that are not properly aligned or in continuity. The third method requires no manual intervention, and is expected to dominate the market in the near future. To this end, in 2019, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy issued a letter recommending that solar power projects be cleaned with effective usage of water, th\u00adrough the deployment of robotic cleaning systems. It also recommended the dep\u00adloy\u00adment of anti-soiling coating technologies to ease the cleaning mechanism. Emerging technologies With the rise in demand for smart cleaning solutions, a number of new products are emerging, enabled by time and cost saving technological developments. In Nov\u00adem\u00adber 2022, Delhi-based Greenleap Ro\u00adbo\u00adtics Private Limited officially launch\u00aded the Lotus A4000. It is a fully auto\u00adno\u00admous, waterless panel cleaning robot. It uses ultra-soft microfibre cleaning fins with combined airflow, and can control its impact to remove dust particles without da\u00admaging a panel\u2019s anti-reflective coating. It can also be used to remove bird droppings. The company promises an 80 to 90 per cent reduction in bird droppings across four cleaning cycles. The robot is powered by an onboard lithium battery and can complete a single cleaning cycle of a 1 MWp solar plant in less than 2.5 ho\u00adurs. The battery takes less than two hours to charge fully. Moreover, new innovations can help combine the operations of cleaning and remo\u00adte monitoring across a solar plant. For instance, in March 2022, Belgian clean-tech start-up ART Robotics revealed a fully automated solar panel cleaning service consisting of autonomous cleaning robots placed on solar panels using drones. The product, named \u201cHelios\u201d, features two parts, the cleaning bot and the drone. The first is a small robot that can clean solar panels on its own. It has a traction system that enables it to move on inclined surfaces, and even cross over to adjacent pa\u00adnels. Using accurate position estimation and edge detection, the robot can navigate autonomously. Its brush and vacuum combination provides a thorough cleaning of the panel surface. The Helios drone pla\u00adces the cleaning robots on the solar panels and retrieves them once cleaning is co\u00admpleted. The deployment process is also autonomous, though it is monitored, in case something goes wrong. Recent developments In October 2022, the Avaada Group sig\u00adn\u00aded a long-term contract with Israel-based Air\u00adtouch Solar for the maintenance of its solar modules using robotic cleaning solutions. The agreement is for a period of 25 years. It includes the supply, erection, testing, commissioning, O&M of Airtouch robotic cleaning systems at Avaada\u2019s solar farms. As part of this agreement, Airtouch will be using its robotic solutions to dryclean the solar modules at its Bhadla plant in Rajasthan and at Pangaon and Damangaon in Ma\u00adha\u00adrashtra. Additio\u00adnally, in September 2022, Airtouch Solar signed an agreement with ReNew Power for the supply, installation, O&M of solar panel-cleaning robots for several projects. These smart solutions are not just limited to large-scale industrial solar farms, but are being applied in the rooftop solar space as well. In May 2022, Skilancer Solar, an India-based clean-tech firm, announced the release of an automated waterless robot for cleaning small-scale solar power plants on household rooftops. Outlook The precious natural resource of water is already limited, and is being overused by the increasing population. Thus, it is extremely important to devise technologies that do not waste it. For solar energy to be purely sustainable, it is crucial to address the water usage of solar plants. As reported by the Solar Energy Industries Asso\u00adciation, water usage by solar power plants depends on the technology and climate conditions at the site. In general, all solar po\u00adwer technologies use a decent amount of water, amounting to approximately 20 gallons per MWh for the cleaning of solar collection and reflection surfaces such as mirrors, heliostats and PV panels. This means that a very high volume of water will be required for India\u2019s planned solar de\u00adployments. This needs to be minimised, be\u00adcause clean en\u00adergy must ensure optimal usage of other valuable resources. The government can play a significant role in promoting the use of efficient cleaning technologies, as well as encouraging research and development towar\u00adds the local production of robotic and automated solutions. This can be done by incentivising the domestic production of such technologies. Drycleaning solutions using artificial intelligence-backed systems can pave the way for waterless cleaning. Going forward, it is important for developers to incorporate these solutions in their ecosystems, as they will help save not only O&M costs but also precious water resources.

The project manager has signed an agreement with financial technology group MICT to build a 110 MWp solar PV plant. The plant will provide clean energy to a factory being built in Delta State in southern Nigeria. The plant of MICT\u2019s subsidiary Tingo Foods is under construction in the village of Ishiekpe in Onicha Ugbo Aniocha North Local Government Area. Work has been ongoing since the beginning of January 2023 and is expected to last between 18 and 24 months. Initiated in the wake of the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the plant which will require an investment of US$1.6 billion is expected to process several commodities including rice, tea, coffee, chocolate, biscuits, edible oil, cashew milk, millet-based cereals, beer, mineral water, soft drinks, pasta and noodles. A solution to load shedding According to Dozy Mmobuosi, the director of Tingo Foods, his factory will also serve as a \u201cplatform for the development and distribution of new products in the future\u201d. By opting for solar energy, Tingo wants to minimise the environmental footprint of its factory while securing its electricity supply in a Nigerian context marked by the resurgence of load shedding. \u201cIn addition to the significant environmental benefits of using on-site renewable energy to power what is expected to be the largest food processing plant in Africa, we will achieve significant savings in energy costs, improving the overall margins and profitability of this extremely exciting and potentially large business within our group,\u201d says Darren Mercer, MICT\u2019s group chief executive officer. Evtec\u2019s financial partners Following the partnership agreement, Tingo is expected to sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Evtec Energy. The David Roberts-led company will invest $150 million. \u201cI am delighted that we have been able to call on the leading clean energy expertise of TAE Power Solutions to help us deliver the optimal technology for the plant,\u201d said Evtec Energy\u2019s president after signing the partnership with Tengo. Evtec Energy is expected to receive financial support for the project from Credit Suisse, the US bank JPMorgan Chase and Roth Capital Partners, an investment bank based in California, USA.

Ms. Rimmer, who has three decades of experience in debt markets and corporate banking, is hoping the bank\u2019s newly-formed energy infrastructure and transition group will be first to carve a successful niche in climate-change-related financing, as well as by hyper-focusing on U.S. renewable power projects. The goal, she said in her first interview since taking on the new role, is to devise long-term strategies to fund energy transition plans that can withstand the volatility of market cycles. \u201cUnder my leadership, I am going to continue to really lean into this trend,\u201d Ms. Rimmer said. The group, formed in mid-2021, now boasts more than 100 investment bankers working exclusively on the energy transition thesis. That means identifying and securing financing deals for companies operating along the renewable energy supply chain \u2013 from turbine builders to utilities \u2013 with a specific focus on the U.S. market. It is a politically popular focus and one with the potential to be extremely lucrative; a recent Royal Bank of Canada report said this country alone must spend roughly $2-trillion to successfully transition to a net-zero economy. \u201cWe all know the questions around growth and inflation, those are quite uncertain, but in the energy transition we continue to see real opportunity,\u201d Ms. Rimmer said. \u201cOur offering is already differentiated, having built our renewable power financing and advisory team in the U.S. over five years ago, and that is also something that exports well.\u201d Ms. Rimmer is far from alone in placing renewed emphasis and resources on sustainable finance, however. Every major Canadian bank is now seeking to bolster its energy transition bona fides. As transition becomes more complex and continues to spread beyond clean tech and renewable power to encompass every other sector of the economy, Ms. Rimmer is entering a war for highly specialized talent, in which victory requires unique expertise. Other major banks have already set up dedicated teams similar to the one CIBC established last year. The banks\u2019 approaches differ, but all are dedicated to reshaping the existing universe of financial products to include sustainability components, while also developing new products in hopes of gaining a competitive edge. \u201cIf you think of the evolution of sustainable finance, there was a point where it was quite narrowly viewed by the majority as being just green bonds,\u201d said Jake Lawrence, chief executive and group head of global banking and markets at Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cIt is so much more than that now.\u201d Not only has the sustainable debt space grown to include dozens of different products in recent years, he said, but executives have started migrating from other areas of banking to focus on the energy transition trend. Fanny Doucet, for example, became Scotiabank\u2019s head of sustainable finance in late 2021, after spending several years in debt markets. \u201cThe sustainable finance market has evolved such that structuring green bonds, most banks can do that now,\u201d Ms. Doucet said. \u201cSo we have to bring something that is different and is additive and is going deeper and we can now go very deep and very technical on sustainability topics with clients, which I don\u2019t think every team can do.\u201d Jonathan Hackett, co-chair of the energy transition group at Bank of Montreal, is building a similar team focused on offering highly-specialized expertise. \u201cYou do need to have more intellectual capital and more people that are able to bring in the different pieces that you need,\u201d he said. For example, Mr. Hackett pointed to Rachel Walsh, who has been BMO\u2019s carbon innovation analyst based in Calgary for little more than a year. \u201cI contrast her work to others in the space, where she has to understand the way carbon credits are created and [others] are trying to do that in addition to covering 24 other industries? I just don\u2019t understand how [creating positions such as carbon innovation analyst] is not something that others are doing.\u201d When bankers approach clients involved in transition from a more general background, Mr. Hackett said, clients can tell. \u201cI think people do realize when they\u2019re being approached opportunistically, versus by people who are focused on the space,\u201d he said. Aaron Engen, Mr. Hackett\u2019s co-chair, said the more generalized approach has been reflected in the job ads he has seen posted by other large banks, which often use ambiguous language and overly broad descriptions. \u201cIt was a managing director job called midstream-downstream energy transition. Like, make up your mind. What are you really doing in a job like that?\u201d Mr. Engen said. \u201cI have seen a lot of those where they have just tagged energy transition to the end of whatever it is they are doing. We have not done that.\u201d As spending on energy transition projects ramps up, all of Canada\u2019s largest banks are bracing for a fight. \u201cThere will be, if you want to call them, ground skirmishes across the economy where people are chasing things like small modular [nuclear] reactors where there are only so many players,\u201d BMO\u2019s Mr. Engen said, \u201cbut that will be just a teeny, thin wedge of what is going on.\u201d Sustainable finance products are expected to become ubiquitous in the coming decades. Scotiabank\u2019s Mr. Lawrence is among those who believe competition between financial institutions will be healthy. \u201cFor the sustainable market to continue to function, it is going to need multiple participants supporting it, on the buy side but on the banking side as well,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need multiple investors who are interested in these products, not just one, and you\u2019ll need multiple banks who are willing and able to structure, sell and, frankly, where it is appropriate, trade and make markets in these assets.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see any one bank wanting to corner the entire market,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \u201cThat concentration produces a type of risk that I think wouldn\u2019t be fully attractive.\u201d Competition is why Ms. Rimmer at CIBC is taking what she calls a \u201cmore specific\u201d approach, targeting renewable power generation projects directly, specifically those based in the United States. There are early signs that her laser focus on a subset of the otherwise amorphous energy transition thesis is achieving success. According to New Jersey-based data analytics firm New Project Media, CIBC was the third-largest financier of U.S. renewable energy projects in 2022, having lent roughly US$1.9-billion. The only other Canadian bank to make the top 10 was National Bank of Canada, which placed seventh for lending slightly more than US$1-billion. Ms. Rimmer hopes CIBC\u2019s niche focus will allow her to build a critical mass of relevant expertise before her rivals. Her team already includes multiple renewable power bankers and tax specialists, she said. \u201cI already have built a lot of that competency in house, but we are not done,\u201d Ms. Rimmer said. \u201cIt is a competitive landscape, but I find that we are very well-positioned to win.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

This includes the introduction of six new products \u2013 three by Renault and Nissan each, and the first of these products will be launched by 2025. Earlier this month, the Renault Group and Nissan had announced that the two companies would collaborate on new SUVs and a new Nissan car based on the Renault Triber. However, today\u2019s announcement gives us clarity on Renault-Nissan\u2019s model lineup for the future. These include four new C-segment SUVs that will rival the likes of the Hyundai Creta, the Kia Seltos, the Skoda Kushaq and the Volkswagen Taigun. Renault-Nissan has stated that these SUVs will be offered only with ICE powertrains, though the company did add that the platforms that these SUVs will be based on are capable of being adapted to PHEV or EV powertrains. The new products will also include two A-segment (hatchback) electric vehicles, and these will be the first EVs for both Renault and Nissan in India. Globally, Renault and Nissan are considering an A-segment EV for markets such as Latin America, and it is likely that these upcoming made in India EVs could be exported to global markets, especially when you consider that left-hand drive versions of the Magnite are exported to global markets from India. The new products are still some time away however, with the first to be launched in 2025. Another important factor in this alliance is that the shareholding has been changed, with Nissan now in the driver\u2019s seat of the alliance, thanks to a 51 per cent shareholding, with Renault\u2019s shareholding at 49 per cent. Renault-Nissan\u2019s future plans for India also include a Rs 5,300 crore investment in the country, and the alliance\u2019s RNAIPL plant in Chennai will be transitioning to carbon-neutrality by 2045, and it will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy.","filter_flag":1}

The national food security project aims to deliver over 27 hectares of production near-term \u2013 with prospects for future expansion on Nadec\u2019s lands. Pure Harvest will design, construct and operate climate-controlled hybrid food production systems that enable year-round production of sustainably-grown, pesticide-free fresh fruits and vegetables, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The parties completed their first project in December 2021, producing over 15 varieties of hydroponically-grown tomatoes in a climate-controlled growing system in Nadec City. The project produces over five million kilograms of locally grown tomatoes per annum, harvesting daily throughout the full year. Pure Harvest aims to deploy substantial production capacity over the next five years in Saudi Arabia, farming a range of crops, while Nadec will market the products across its consumer base, hotels, restaurants, and catering partners. The partners share a \u201cvision to assist in the transition towards greater food security, water conservation, economic diversification, and sustainability in the kingdom, as well as the broader GCC region,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe greatly benefit from Nadec\u2019s strength, and together we are pioneering a new category of fresh produce for the Saudi people \u2013 premium local. High-quality, delicious, safe and affordable fresh produce that is always in season\u2026 offering new varieties, new products, and a fundamentally novel fresh produce experience,\u201d said Sky Kurtz, founder and CEO of Pure Harvest Smart Farms. As part of their partnership, Nadec and Pure Harvest will collaborate to support existing local farmers, by developing sustainable solutions that can be deployed to improve yields, reduce water consumption, and boost production quality. \u201cWe are delighted to be partnering with Pure Harvest Smart Farms and to bring their distinctive controlled-environment agriculture solutions and expertise to the kingdom,\u201d added Dr Solaiman A. AlTwaijri, CEO of Nadec. \u201cNadec has a long tradition of supplying a broad range of staple food products to both the kingdom and the surrounding region. Moving into the supply of high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables is a natural extension of our legacy.\u201d Pure Harvest\u2019s growing systems result in very low water consumption per kilogram of production, and is principally powered using Nadec\u2019s renewable energy. Furthermore, it can harvest waste heat from existing fossil fuel power plants and nearby infrastructure and deploy this energy to offset power demands in its climate systems. The agritech firm raised $180.5m in its biggest ever fundraising last year, from backers including the billionaire Olayan family, which runs one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest conglomerates.

Dairy co-ops, for example, have used this approach to transform their primary ingredient and waste streams, milk and whey, into high-value products to become major players in the international food industry. Clonbio Group, an Irish-owned renewable energy and nutrition company based in Hungary, has adopted a similar strategy and is rapidly diversifying from primarily producing maize-ethanol for fuel to a range of high-value products. In a little over 10 years, the company has grown to rival the successes of major Irish food companies like Kerry Group and Glanbia. The range of food and feed products produced by Clonbio. The 65% barley protein product. The Irish Farmers Journal recently visited the company\u2019s flagship plant in Hungary along with a delegation from the Irish Bioeconomy Forum. Members of the Irish Bioeconomy Forum. Continued investment Clonbio\u2019s primary processing facility, spanning 100ac, is located an hour outside of Budapest along the Danube. The company was founded and built by Dublin native Mark Turley, who began his entrepreneurial journey by selling cars in Rathdown at the age of 18. From there, he moved to property and after finding success in the European property market, in 2008, he turned his attention to renewable energy. Mark Turley, founder and chief executive (left) and Eric Sievers, investment director (right). According to Mark, he evaluated various technologies, such as anaerobic digestion (AD), solar, wind, incineration, biomass and biodiesel, but ultimately found that none of them were practical without subsidies. The exception was ethanol, which could be produced at a competitive cost and easily blended into fuels, resulting in a minimum of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The barley protein plant can process up to 300,000t of barley each year. At the time, there was no mandate to include ethanol in fuels in Europe, but since then, a biofuel mandate has been introduced in most countries. After assessing multiple types of ethanol plants, he settled on a US brand, Fagan ICM, which was in operation in 94 other locations across the world. Mark decided to locate the plant in Hungary, in part due to the country\u2019s large agricultural area and good connectivity to Europe. The plant was turn-key and followed a standardised design and technology. However, this standardisation resulted in inefficiencies, particularly when it came to electricity and gas use. At the time, energy prices were significantly higher in Europe than in the US, so work began to improve the efficiency of the plant immediately. Like most ethanol plants in the US, the primary ingredient used is maize. Approximately 1.3m tonnes are sourced annually from local farmers to supply the plant. The ethanol is transported to the train in a lorry for export to Europe. Ethanol is an alcohol that is typically made by fermenting and distilling grains. The maize is ground to create a mash, which is then mixed with water and enzymes to break down the starches in the grain into simple sugars. Next, yeast is added to the mixture, which ferments the sugars and produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. The mixture is then distilled and purified, producing around half a billion litres of standard grade ethanol annually. This represents around 15% of Europe\u2019s total capacity. The remaining mash is dried and sold as dried distillers grain, which is used for animal feed. Around 400,000t of feed (33-34% protein content) is produced each year and helps to reduce Europe\u2019s dependency on imported soya meal. Clonbio estimates that protein rich feed from the EU biofuels sector cuts soya import demand by over a quarter. Zero waste The Fagan ICM ethanol plant was designed to be zero waste, with a focus on recycling all materials. The process generates large quantities of waste water, which is recycled back into the fermenters. However, the waste water contains a wide variety of fats, fibres and proteins. Work soon began on developing new methods at the plant to separate each component from the waste water, creating various new products. The waste water contains soluble protein, which, when extracted, could raise the protein content of dried distillers grains to 37%. However, by drying and processing it separately, they discovered that they could produce a new protein product of 55% protein content suitable for human consumption. The separated fibre is used as feedstock for the AD plant. This could compete with traditional sources of plant protein made from peas and beans for alternative meat markets. They recently built a plant on the site capable of producing 55,000t of this new plant protein annually. They were also able to extract a soluble fibre product from the grain, which is one of their most promising new products. When extracted, the product can be used as a natural food sweetener with probiotic properties. They are just months away from commissioning a new plant built to extract this fibre. After these processes, they found that the water still had usable nutrients. So, they created a new system that uses these nutrients to feed bacteria, producing a 75% animal protein product in less than 20 hours through aerobic fermentation. The clean water is then reused back in the fermenters. The AD plants produce 20% of the facility's energy requirements. To improve efficiency even further, they developed the world\u2019s first maize fibre separation plant to remove around 3.5% of insoluble fibre from the grain before fermentation. This fibre can be processed further into a number of products, but requires high amounts of energy to do so. Therefore, most of the fibre is used as feedstock for the on-site AD plants. These AD plants produce 3,400m3 of biogas per hour using only maize fibre, supplying 20% of the site\u2019s power. They aim to expand the AD plant this year, while facilities for upgrading to biomethane and injection into the gas grid are already commissioned. Digestate produced from the AD plant. The AD plant generates a large amount of digestate, which is further processed, dried and pelletised to produce 10,000t of low carbon organic biofertiliser annually. The only waste coming from the plant is vapour from multiple processes. After exploring various uses for this, they settled on a German mechanical vapour recompression system, which recovers energy from ethanol vapour, making it available for process heat, considerably reducing external gas usage. Barley protein The barley protein plant can process up to 300,000t of barley each year. At the time of visiting the plant, they were just months away from commissioning a new barley protein plant, the first of its kind in the world. Covering 10ac, the plant will extract a 65% protein product from barley and, with its neutral flavour and versatility, the team believe this product will become a strong competitor to conventional plant protein sources. When fully operational, the plant will be able to process 300,000t of barley. Future of ethanol Mark and the team are continually expanding the business to diversify the original ethanol plant from fuel production. The European ethanol industry faces intense competition from lower-cost imports from South and North America and is struggling with high energy prices. In the previous year, only half of the plant\u2019s output was fuel ethanol, the rest being sold for use in industrial products like solvents and sanitisers. By the end of the month, they will commission a new plant on-site to produce high-quality extra neutral alcohol, suitable for use in food, technology, medical and other high-end industries. One of the dryers to produce dried distillers grain. Clonbio has also invested in a range of AD, solar, wind and ethanol projects across Europe and the US. Integration Since its construction in 2012, the plant has trebled in size. As a result, it has become highly complex and interlinked with eight control centres for processes dotted around the site. These control centres are soon to be relocated to a new, high-tech \u20ac3m central hub. The new \u20ac3m control centre. Mark notes that a single malfunction can affect the entire plant, so they needed to develop the new control centre to be able to share information effectively among key engineers. Clonbio in Ireland In 2021, Clonbio acquired a stake in Kildare-based business Green Generation, which was established by Billy Costello in 2012. Green Generation operates an AD plant and runs the only onshore gas injection facility in Ireland, where it manages renewable gas from other AD operators on the island. Green Generation also recycles mixed plastics (from food waste packaging) and has commissioned the first commercial scale plastics upcycling plant, which uses patented Polymer Alloy Technology Teoranta (paltech) technology. Paltech technology recycles plastic food waste packaging into heavy duty items such as electricity poles and road barriers. Clonbio say it is hoping Irish infrastructure bodies will support product and market development efforts for this product as part of their circular economy commitments.. It believes the technology can help solve a substantial portion of Ireland\u2019s waste plastic challenge. In total, Clonbio has invested over \u20ac25m in biogas and plastics development in Ireland in the last couple of years.","filter_flag":1}

Ashwani Gupta, COO of Nissan Motor Corporation announced that the Renault Nissan alliance is writing the next chapter of its alliance in India, after the global alliance restructuring announced by the company in London in the first week of February. The Renault Nissan alliance is going to develop, manufacture, sell and export six brand new vehicles in India, of which four will be SUVs and two \u2018A segment EVs. To execute this, the alliance will invest $600 million or Rs 5,300 crore in the country and generate employment for more than 2,000 people. The plan is to also make the Orgadam manufacturing facility on the outskirts of Chennai completely based on renewable energy by 2045. After signing the MoU on Feb 13, Gupta addressed media persons (where Autocar Professional was also present) and spoke about future plans and the importance of this investment. \u201cThis investment is very significant not only for products but for technologies like EV to really capture the growing Indian market which is the third largest market in the world. The alliance wants to use India as a base for export.\u201d Excerpts: Could you share details on your future plans? First of all, it will be a shared investment, second, we have graduated from cross badging. We don\u2019t start with a product anymore, we start with the customer and as you would have seen, we have a very clear brand distinctiveness, you will not call it a cross badge. You would have seen the latest Micra EV, which we announced in Europe, though it is based on Renault 5, you will see it is quite distinctive, so all the six cars which we are talking about three will be Nissan, three will be Renault and they will all be distinctive, in all our shared cars like Magnite, Aria etc. Will Nissan\u2019s products overlap with Renaults\u2019? The segment will overlap, but there is a great potential for both brands to grow. \u2018A\u2019 segment is growing more than 40 percent, \u2018C\u2019 segment is growing more than 40 percent, I think we have enough space based on our product competitiveness to share this space and come together, and demonstrate competitiveness in the marketplace. The key point for us is to be competitive in the market. What about A segment EVs? This will be a completely new EV. This product will have our experience of the last 13 years of Leaf around the world. You would have seen Nissan Aria and Nissan Sakura have been great success around the world, especially with Sakura in Japan, which represents \u2014 40 percent of the market. It has been triple crowned as Kei car of the year, and also EV of the year. So all of our experience in design, development and manufacturing and selling of battery electric cars of 13 years, Nissan will be capitalising its experience and putting it in the A segment cars. What are your plans for localising batteries? With the battery manufacturing, the biggest opportunity or challenge is the vertical integration, which is what we are working on right now with the state and central government to make sure that we are capitalising on all the government schemes to make sure our battery electric cars are localised and competitive. The more details we will share in the future. We have signed the MoU today, we have already made some investment in product study etc, first sop will be 2025. Starting 2023, within three to five years, these investments will be made. But these investments are for products, if we decide to do more on EVs, we will do more investments, so this investment is just the start, to define mainly the product investment and modernisation of existing plants to do these six products. Maybe if the market is growing as it is growing today, if the products are accepted today the same as Nissan Magnite, we may think of increasing it. We may start with very cautious investment in India. Is the investment shared and till what time frame? We are keeping Indian operations autonomous. RNAIPL (Renault Nissan Alliance India) will remain RNAIPL, RNTBCI (Renault Nissan Technology Business Centre India) will remain RNTBCI. The R&D centre in India will support Renault Nissan's global R&D efforts \u2014 but the thing which we are changing in line with the global capital restructuring \u2014 in India also, we will be redefining the capital structure between Renault Nissan. Renault Nissan Alliance is today 70 percent Nissan, 30 percent Renault, now it will be 51 percent Nissan and 49 percent Renault. On the other side, 30 percent Nissan, 70 percent Renault will be 51 percent Renault and 49 percent Nissan. This equal partnership will help us in unleashing all the potential in the future. We have already started the investment, started working on the products, the first product will be out in 2025 and within a few years of launching the products, the investment will be finalised (consummated). Then we will prepare for the next phase of investment. This investment will be for the first six cars and some money will go into the modernisation of our plant. Our current utilisation is about 49 percent, we want to take up the utilisation to 80 percent used for both domestic and exports. Will the investment go into expansion? The main investment will be for product, Chennai plant already has significant capacity, about 49 percent is getting utilised today, with these products, we see the utilization of 80 percent - catering to both local and exports needs. Having said that, when we talk of electrification, this plant will need some investment in modernization, with new technologies, that is not included in this $600 million investment. It is mainly for the product, in the near future, we have no plans to expand the capacity, our target is to use the capacity which we have installed using local as well exports volumes. How will you manage till 2025, will your brands need a rejuvenation? Yes, you are right. We have gone through different product and brand lifecycles in India in the last 13 years. So that is needed, our brand is more driven by customer experience and not common architecture alone. This is what we have demonstrated with Magnite. Even with one product which is covering just 15 percent of the market, we have about 1-1.5 percent market share. This has only happened, because we have developed our brand step by step, with the three new products \u2014 we will take it to the next level. We are thankful to dealer bodies and customers who have trusted Nissan with just one model. That gave us the confidence to invest. These six models (along with Renault) will be localised in India, so we need to time to do that, of course we have to go through the transition, in addition as we said before, to keep that momentum, we are considering some of the CBUs in India, so that we keep the Nissan brand moving forward. Magnite covers 15 percent of the segment, with A and C segment vehicles in the future, Nissan will cover 40 percent of the Indian automotive market. Is Hybrid part of your future plans? Nissan's global electrification strategy is driven by each individual region's needs. Each region's needs are driven by customer, infrastructure and magnitude of government support. When you look at Europe, all three exist, that is why today, 20 percent of the market is BEV, but the evolution in Europe started in 2010, already 13 years to transit to this level of electrification. When it comes to Japan, Nissan was the only automaker to do battery electric and that is where hybrids are dominating now, but there is a shift towards EVs. In China, things are moving towards battery electric. As you can see, there is always dispersion in the product mix and technology mix in each market. When we look at India, of course, the internal combustion engine is the main (powertrain) today, with 0.5 percent of battery electric vehicles, but the government policies are supporting BEV, and if we have more BEV products in India, the market will grow. I do believe that Battery Electric Vehicle will be a key strategic Pillar for India electrification growth and not the hybrid.

If both economic growth and lending growth, especially in the private sector, are low, there is no way the government will be able to solve unemployment because the general public will fear seeking loans due to the high interest rates - and the banks will be stuck with the money as there will be no investments coming up - hence leading to the closing down of businesses, which leads to low consumption and purchasing power, static or declining economic growth, high taxes, high prices, demonstrations, strikes, murder, theft, corruption, etc. It\u2019s high time banks diversified their portfolio and embraced Islamic banking, reducing their risk exposure to sensitive sectors like oil and gas since the world is moving towards renewable energy. When oil prices fall, it becomes very risky to hold oil as a financial asset, which is why some countries are becoming less reliant on oil and gas production. It\u2019s no longer in the interest of major oil-producing countries to restrain output as they seek to produce and export as much as they can because, in the near future, we see factors like climate change, new electric car technologies, clean hydrogen energy, solar and wind energy, and shale going to erode long-term demand for crude oil in the next decade as technology makes fossil fuels obsolete. Saudi Arabia has come up with an ambitious yet achievable plan called Saudi Vision 2030, introducing a futuristic $500 billion NEOM development project among them called \"The Line,\" showing how urban cities can look in the future with zero carbon emissions, which means no cars or roads. The aim is to reduce Saudi Arabia\u2019s dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public services such as education, infrastructure, health, tourism, communication, science, and technology. It's high time Uganda too increases local production in agriculture through Islamic banking agriculture business loan products that are suitable for farmers' needs, increases production in manufacturing, building materials, animal production, pharmaceuticals, tourism, communication, science, and technology, and also reduces costs on goods imported and encourages more exports. As of 2018, the US surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s top crude oil producers. This means that if the US or Russia increases production and there is a low demand for oil in China and Europe, combined with a steady supply of oil from OPEC, or if China automatically buys oil from Iran, there will be an excess supply of oil and oil prices will fall due to supply and demand laws. As a result, non-OPEC countries will be discouraged from producing due to production hurdles and costs; for example, it is cheaper to extract oil in the Middle East than in Alberta, Canada; oil price volatility; sometimes high-interest rates impact oil prices; older wells that are less productive; and others experiencing high costs for new projects coupled with increased demand for oil in home countries due to increased demand for oil. As we continue seeing Islamic finance as one of the fastest-growing segments of financial opportunity in the world today, growth in the Islamic banking sector largely outpaces that of conventional banks in most systems in which Islamic banks have been embraced due to proactive governments, high demand for Shariah-compliant products, and strong retail demand, which provides greater stability for their funding profiles and legislation for the industry, and this positions Africa as the third fastest-growing region after the Middle East and Asia. According to Muhammad Zubair Mughal, chief executive officer of AlHuda Centre of Islamic Banking and Economics (CIBE), the total volume of Islamic finance is expected to hit more than $3.8 trillion this year, and global Islamic finance assets are projected to be nearly $5 trillion by 2025, proving that Islamic banking is no longer an alien in the global financial industry. With this in mind, the majority of non-Muslim countries, including Uganda are working tirelessly to become the financial hub in their respective regions by introducing Shariah-compliant financial products into their markets to meet the demands of the Muslim population of 1.97 billion adherents, accounting for more than 25 per cent of the world's population and the second-fastest growing religion, growing faster than the world's population projected by the Pew Research Center. It is, therefore, imperative for Ugandan educational institutions; colleges and universities to start adopting programs in Islamic finance that reflect the importance of the role of Islamic finance in our global economy. As Shariah-compliant banking is becoming very attractive within the East African region, in Uganda, people's perceptions are changing, public awareness is increasing day by day, and a large number of customers of conventional banks, insurance companies, and microfinance institutions are demanding its introduction as competition will automatically lower interest rates. Uganda is best suited for Islamic finance because of its good regulation and legislation, economic stability, and mature open market that will accelerate economic growth if Islamic banking is developed. Global growth has slowed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, disruptions from climate change, and trade and technological disputes between China and the USA. Therefore, nations that are suffering from low growth should adopt this segment in their banking sector faster. Uganda\u2019s approach to adopting Islamic finance has been slow, cautious, and steady in order to avoid any shocks to its stable banking sector. To avoid volatility and an even banking landscape, the banking sector must be thoroughly studied before opening up to competitors and introducing new products into the market, as there is a huge prospect for growth in the Islamic finance sector, which is rising particularly in East Africa, as evidenced by foreign Islamic banks setting up branches and subsidiaries in these countries, as well as some banks applying for licenses from the Uganda Central Bank. This shows a continued surge in the banking sector's popularity with the general public, and we hope it grows immensely further. Uganda is a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Kenya is also looking to be a member, knowing the benefits that come with it. Given the high population growth rate in East Africa and Uganda, whose population is projected to reach 75 million by 2040 at a growth rate of 3 per cent per year and is the world's third fastest-growing population, and with large swaths of the population currently unbanked, potential customers may require new services in the years to come, some from Muslims who profess their faith to open up accounts. Uganda being a strategic country for the Islamic Development Bank Group, it\u2019s advisable for both regional and international financial institutions to look for franchise opportunities here as an integral part of their ever-expanding global operations and to take advantage of the positive macroeconomic environment taking place. We are seeing international insurance firms enter the Ugandan market simply because of the good economic growth of 2019, with at least 6.1 per cent. Still, it has slowed down due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now with the discovery of oil fields, rapid real estate development, Uganda National Airlines, booming tourism, various minerals, a rapid population growth, and all their assets, people need to be insured. With this in mind, we will be able to witness a good percentage of existing customers in conventional banks switch to Shariah-compliant banking services within Uganda, just as we have witnessed Shariah-compliant banking in Africa growing by leaps and bounds due to the continuous introduction of specific tailored products and services in addition to increased awareness among the general public. THE NEED With the high rate at which the Islamic finance industry in Africa is developing, it has gained the attention of stakeholder groups, including central banks and regulatory authorities, as well as leading international Islamic and non-Islamic financial institutions and investors who want to tap into the high growth opportunities on the continent. In Uganda, a few authorities such as the Central Bank, Uganda Microfinance Support Centre, Insurance Regulatory Authority, Uganda Muslim Supreme Council, Uganda Insurers Association, Insurance Training College of Uganda, and other institutions and centres are helping in promoting and developing Islamic finance. Uganda should take advantage of Islamic finance because it\u2019s already proven to be a strategic instrument to tap into the unbanked population and address the important issue of financial inclusion, as well as a catalyst for boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade flows among Africa, East Asia, the Middle East, the OIC, and international markets. By offering low-income people digitalized banking services, they will be able to increase penetration. Uganda can attract billions of dollars, including Shariah-compliant funds, to finance government-backed projects such as railways, oil pipelines, refineries, roads, domestic manufacturing, industrial parks like Namanve and others, vocational institutions, tourism, dams, mining, innovative agriculture, airport expansion, and interest-free loans (Qard Hassan). Uganda has poor infrastructure, so there is a substantial need for project financing. Sukuk (Islamic bonds) have emerged as a viable and strong source of attracting international funding for both commercial and development projects, and they could easily diversify funding sources, ensure better monitoring of fund deployment, and contribute to the country's private sector development. There is a great increase in the standardization of legal documents and Shariah interpretation globally, which means the demand for Sukuk (Islamic bonds) is increasingly creating new opportunities in multiple economies that benefit the sector. If Uganda goes for sovereign and corporate Sukuk (Islamic bonds), it could attract investment funds from the Middle East and the wider world and also provide a useful instrument for liquid holdings of Islamic banks. According to the World Bank Group, it also decided to push for Islamic banking as a more sustainable alternative to conventional banking practices at the 2015 World Bank\/IMF Spring Meeting in Washington, DC, USA. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2010, a new study compared the performance of Islamic banks and conventional banks during the 2007\u201308 financial crisis and found that Islamic banks, on average, showed stronger resilience during the global financial crisis. It looked at the effect of the crisis on banks' profitability, credit, and asset growth in countries where both types of banks had a significant market share. The Vatican has put forward the idea that \"the principles of Islamic finance may represent a possible cure for ailing markets.\" The Catholic Church has always forbidden usury (interest), but in recent centuries it has been forced to tolerate it due to non-Catholic dominance in the Western World. Islamic Finance and Impact Investing Network (IFIIN), a non-government organization, promotes Islamic finance and impact investing as one of the best innovative avenues to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) not only in Muslim countries but also in non-Muslim countries in Africa. Having that in mind, Islamic banking is not only for Muslims; it\u2019s for all, and all the financial products that will be on the market will be for all Ugandans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, which is vital for sustained growth of the industry in the future. This message should be conveyed to the public as efficiently as possible because Islamic finance has proven to be a source of investment activity in both the Muslim world and the global financial market. One of the advantages of Islamic banking is that it emphasizes moral and ethical values within its banking operations, which have a wide universal appeal.
