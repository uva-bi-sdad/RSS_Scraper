In a news conference Thursday, Gov. Katie Hobbs announced the restrictions that could affect some of the fastest-growing suburbs of the nation\u2019s fifth-largest city. Officials said developers could still build in the affected areas but would need to find alternative water sources to do so \u2014 such as surface or recycled water. Driving the state\u2019s decision was a projection that showed that over the next 100 years, demand in metro Phoenix for almost 4.9 million acre-feet of groundwater would be unmet without further action, Hobbs said. An acre-foot of water is roughly enough for two to three U.S. households per year. Despite the move, the governor said the state isn\u2019t running out of water. \u201cNobody who has water is going to lose their water,\u201d Hobbs said. Officials said the move would not affect existing homeowners who already have assured water supplies. Hobbs added that there are 80,000 unbuilt homes that will be able to move forward because they already have assured water supply certificates within the Phoenix Active Management Area, a designation used for regulating groundwater. Years of drought in the West worsened by climate change have ratcheted up pressure among Western states to use less water. Much of the focus has stayed on the dwindling Colorado River, a main water source for Arizona and six other Western states. Over the past two years, Arizona\u2019s supply from the 1,450-mile powerhouse of the West has been cut twice. Phoenix relies on imported Colorado River water and also uses water from the in-state Salt and Verde rivers. A small amount of the city\u2019s water supply comes from groundwater and recycled wastewater. The drought has made groundwater \u2014 held in underground aquifers that can take many years to be replenished \u2014 even more vital. Under a 1980 state law aimed at protecting the state\u2019s aquifers, Phoenix, Tucson and other Arizona cities have restrictions on how much groundwater they can pump. But in rural areas, there are few limitations on its use. Long pumped by farmers and rural residents in Arizona with little oversight, Hobbs and other state officials recently vowed to take more steps to protect the state\u2019s groundwater supplies. In rapidly growing Phoenix suburbs such as Queen Creek and Buckeye, developers have relied on unallocated groundwater to show that they had adequate water supplies for the next 100 years, which Arizona requires for building permits in some areas. \u201cDevelopers rely on groundwater because it has been frankly, cheaper and easier for them, and they have been able to move through the process much more quickly,\u201d said Nicole Klobas, chief counsel for the Arizona Department of Water Resources. Under the new restrictions, that won\u2019t be possible. \u201cIt closes off that path,\u201d said Kathryn Sorenson, director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. Because the rule largely affects cities and towns outside Phoenix and larger cities in the metro area, Sorenson said developers would likely \u201cweigh whether they want to continue to buy relatively cheap land ... and incur the cost of developing a whole new water supply versus purchase land that is probably more expensive without the boundaries of a designated city.\u201d ___ Naishadham reported from Washington, D.C.","filter_flag":1}

Shopping ethically is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and overall emissions, especially now that more and more brands are focusing on producing better quality clothes with a seasonless aesthetic, meaning customers won't grow tired of them after a few months. But with so much sustainable fashion around, knowing how to pick the right brands can be tricky, especially when so many are guilty of greenwashing. With that in mind, here at Marie Claire we've put together a guide to help you. What is the difference between ethical and sustainable clothing brands? There is a lot of confusion between the terms 'ethical' and 'sustainable.' No, the two aren't the same. Treating staffers, suppliers and so on in an ethical manner is just one part of being a sustainable business. There are different ways to produce ethical clothing, and according to the Ethical Fashion Forum, they generally fall into three categories - social, environmental and commercial. The forum specifically tackles these issues: Countering fast, cheap fashion and damaging patterns of fashion consumption Defending fair wages, working conditions and workers\u2019 rights, and supporting sustainable livelihoods Addressing toxic pesticide and chemical use, using and\/or developing eco-friendly fabrics and components Minimising water use Recycling and addressing energy efficiency and waste Developing or promoting sustainability standards for fashion Providing resources, training and\/or awareness-raising initiatives Protecting animal rights (L + R) Fashion Editor Zoe Anastasiou dressed in Omnes and Reformation.

When it comes to sustainable fashion brands, there are many things to consider including how a brand sources its fabrics, how they manufacture and transport their products, and how they sell items in a planet-friendly way. As Joanna Dai, founder of the B Corp-certified clothing brand Dai shares, every new product put out into the world has an impact - however, some brands are doing better than others to minimise their mark. We asked Dai for her expertise on how you can ensure a brand is genuine in its sustainability efforts. Marie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors How can you spot if a brand is genuine in its sustainability efforts? Joanna Dai outlines her tips below. Accountability - \"For real change, brands must be accountable for their impacts and decisions across the entire business,\" she shares. \"Brands that achieve B Corp certification are invested in running a responsible business.\" Fabrics - \"Look to brands that are using certified plant-based or innovative recycled materials as much as possible,\" she recommends. End of life - \"Sustainability doesn\u2019t end once the customer checks out their basket. Look out for brands that offer repairs and take-back schemes that help increase a garment\u2019s longevity or encourage responsible recycling,\" she encourages. \"We recently introduced Dai\u2019Cycle, a programme where customers can drop off their preloved Dai clothing in exchange for a \u00a325 gift card to use on their next in-store purchase. We will renew and repair the donated pieces and offer them in-store as preloved items to new customers, or donate it to our charity partner Smart Works.\" Building products to last - \"Alongside an end-of-life programme, invest in brands and products that are well designed and built to last,\" she goes on. \"This is a founding principle at Dai, I personally road-test each and every product to make sure it performs and functions for our customers now, and for years to come.\" Valuing people - \"Sustainability must combine people and the planet. Look at brands' supplier codes of conduct or commitments to paying fair and living wages to ensure the people who are making your garments are being treated well.\" Marie Claire UK's Sustainability Editor, Ally Head, agrees, adding that shopping for sustainable clothing can feel like a minefield when you've got brands greenwashing left, right and centre. Her advice? \"Always check whether a brand has a B Corp certification. If they do, it means they've undergone the most rigorous testing - qualifying can take as long as three years (!) - to make sure their practices are plant-friendly across all aspects of their business. They have a detailed directory on their site of all the brands that have qualified.\" A post shared by B Corporation UK (@bcorpuk) A photo posted by on Secondly, do your research - often, if a brand actually works to sustainable practice, they'll have a whole page dedicated to it on their website. \"Do read up and also carefully consider both the eco-claims they are making and how they say their business is structured - do they promote fast fashion, do they rack up air miles like there's no tomorrow, and do they still send products out in non-recyclable or non-biodegradable materials? Even if a brand says they're sustainable, they might be greenwashing - for example, a global company that churns out new designs every day doesn't *sound* sustainable to us.\" And thirdly, use your common sense. \"Buying secondhand, shopping in vintage stores, using pre-loved fashion sites or renting clothes are all great ways to shop sustainably and lower the impact that creating new clothes can have on the environment,\" Ally explains. Keep on scrolling to discover our favourite sustainable clothing brands - and while you're here, check out our favourite ethical jewellery brands and sustainable sports brands, too. The best sustainable clothing brands you need to know about: Dai VIEW NOW Dai is a B Corp-certified clothing brand founded by Joanna Dai. Not only is the brand using performance 4-way stretch, machine washable, wrinkle resistant fabrics and designing some of the most comfortable clothes ever, but they are also committed to doing good for people and the planet. Sustainability is woven into every fibre of their brand DNA. They use over 60% recycled or plant-based yarns and recently introduced Dai\u2019Cycle, a programme where customers can drop off their preloved Dai clothing in exchange for a \u00a325 gift card to use on their next in-store purchase. The brand will renew and repair the donated pieces and offer in-store as preloved items to new customers, or donate it to their charity partner Smart Works. Editor Verdict: \"I am OBSESSED with this brand. I met the founder Joanna earlier in the year and loved hearing about her journey of launching a fashion brand that's genuinely sustainable, too (they're a certified B Corp). Their suit trousers and navy striped shirt are my personal favourite items from their collection, but everything is gorgeous.\" - Ally Head, Health & Sustainability Editor. OMNES VIEW NOW OMNES means all, with the brand's ethos being that we are all in this together. The brand is aware that fashion is one of the worst polluters, so even when sketching clothes, designers think of styles and fabrics that you will wear as long as possible. The brand also uses offcuts in accessories to minimise waste, and audits its factories in Romania, India and London to make sure they comply with Health and Safety, Environment, Business Ethics and Labour Standards. Editor Verdict: \"When it comes to chic dresses and understated event wear, Omnes is one of my favourites. I love the brand's signature cowl neck slip dresses, which are often made from recycled polyester, Ecovero Viscose or deadstock fabric. The shapes are so flattering and they're the kind of dresses you can wear for years to come for all manner of different occasions.\" - Zoe Anastasiou, Fashion Editor Ninety Percent Visit Site Ninety Percent gained its name thanks to its unique business model, which sees the brand sharing 90% of its profits between its people and charitable causes that prioritise the planet. In addition to this, the brand also prides itself on transparency and traceability, as well as the use of sustainable materials. The label focuses on the use of natural, renewable and certified organic materials, including Linen, ENKA Viscose, Tencel, Micro Modal and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified organic cotton. And also uses low-impact finishes like plant-based buttons and nickle free metals. Reformation VIEW NOW With a slogan that reads, \"Being naked is the #1 most sustainable option. We're #2,\" you could deduce that Reformation is a brand that prides itself on its sustainability efforts. The brand hopes to achieve Climate Positivity by 2025, with a goal that includes sourcing 100% of its fabrics from either recycled, regenerative or renewable materials. Reformation recently released a circular denim collection and is even working to develop vegan, plastic-free leather made from Mycelium (which is the root-like structure of a mushroom). With Nothing Underneath Visit Site As a B Corp-certified brand, you can guarantee that With Nothing Underneath is prioritising the planet and is conscious about its environmental impact. The brand thrives on the ethos of buying less and buying better, offering a whole host of timeless wardrobe staples that are guaranteed to stay in your wardrobe for years to come. In terms of materials, the brand uses Organic Cotton, Tencel, recycled Silk and even its buttons are made from Corozo nuts. Editor Verdict: \"There is, in my opinion, no shirt brand that compares to With Nothing Underneath. I own three of the brand's shirts and wear them season in, season out. Not only is the quality exceptional, but the fit is second to none\u2014nailing that laid-back, casual vibe that still oozes luxury and expense. They're not wildly expensive in the grand scheme of things, but still more than your average \u00a330 Zara buy. However, when I think about the cost per wear compared to high-street alternatives in my wardrobe, With Nothing Underneath comes out on top every single time.\" - Shannon Lawlor, Acting Senior Beauty Editor Arkitaip Visit Site Arkitaip is focused on creating clothing that will last, with timeless designs and well-crafted construction. Created in Europe, Arkitaip utilises 100% Masters Of Linen-certified linen and can pinpoint where 95% of its raw materials originate. The brand's garment workers are also treated with the utmost care and protected by the EU's European Employment Strategy. Everything is created in Portugal in a small, family-run factory. In addition to all of this, Arkitaip is also a member of 1% for the planet, an initiative which commits to donating 1% of a brands profit to environmental causes. MyCashmere VIEW NOW As another young brand founded just last year, MyCashmere is bringing sustainable practices to the cashmere sector. The brand produces its clothing in Italy, using either 100% SFA (Sustainable Fibre Alliance) certified yarn or Re-Verso Recycled Cashmere, which is made from post-factory leftovers. The label even takes its sustainable ethos into its packaging, using grass paper packaging which is biodegradable and free from plastic. Ultimately, each of MyCashmere's pieces is created to become a timeless addition to your wardrobe and the kind of classic item you will keep for years to come. S\u00e9zane VIEW NOW S\u00e9zane has become one of the first-ever French brands to obtain a B Corp certification. With its origin in vintage, S\u00e9zane believes the pieces that we wear today should become the vintage of tomorrow. From the transformation of their production methods and choice of materials to reducing their delivery and packaging footprint, S\u00e9zane is committed to concrete sustainability measures. Today, three-quarters of the materials in their current collection are eco-friendly. They have obtained 5 certifications (GOTS, Oeko-Tex, FSC, RWS and RMS ) and released their first 100% eco-friendly denim line. Since 2018 S\u00e9zane has raised over 4.5 million euros for the philanthropic program DEMAIN. On the 21st of every month, 10% of global turnover and 100% of the proceeds from a dedicated design are donated to programs which support access to education and equality of opportunity for children all over the world. Editor Verdict: \"Nothing says French girl chic, quite like S\u00e9zane. The brand offers timeless staples that you will want to wear for years to come. After all, aside from manufacturing and fabrication, another true test of a sustainable wardrobe is ensuring you wear and re-wear your clothes again and again. Nothing is more sustainable than the clothes already in your wardrobe.\" - Zoe Anastasiou, Fashion Editor O Pioneers Visit Site O Pioneers proudly describes themselves as a brand that represents the 'antithesis of fast fashion.'

Under the agreement, Novelis will supply Coca-Cola's authorized North American bottlers with aluminum can sheet for The Coca-Cola Company's family of iconic brands. This includes supply from Novelis' plant in Bay Minette, Ala., which is currently under construction and expected to begin commissioning in 2025. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola North American bottlers, through the CCBSS and Novelis agreement, have committed to purchasing a confidential volume of aluminum can sheet over a multi-year period. \"This new long-term contract builds on a decades-long relationship between Novelis and the Coca-Cola system, and further strengthens Novelis' position as the leading provider of aluminum for beverage cans,\" said Steve Fisher, President and CEO of Novelis. \"This contract validates our investment in expanding rolling and recycling capacity in North America and solidifies a strong future for sustainable aluminum as the beverage packaging material of choice.\" The contract includes an agreement for closed-loop recycling, highlighting both companies' commitments to sustainability. Through closed-loop recycling programs, Novelis directly takes back the manufacturing scrap generated during the can making process, recycles it and converts it into new can sheet, which is then made into new beverage cans. In addition to this continuous loop, Novelis recycles more than 80 billion used beverage cans per year into new aluminum for beverage packaging. These efforts result in lower-carbon products, as recycling aluminum is approximately 95% less energy intensive than making primary aluminum, resulting in 95% less carbon emissions. Novelis expects demand for aluminum beverage can sheet to grow at a 3% compounded annual growth rate from 2022 to 2031. The demand growth is driven by consumer preference for more sustainable products and size variety, as well as more beverage types being packed in cans, including water, energy drinks, soda, beer, wine, hard seltzers and ready-to-drink cocktails. Dan Coe, Chief Procurement Officer of The Coca-Cola Company, stated that \"the evolving role on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company and our Bottlers is to build a resilient domestic supply chain, thus enabling sustainable long-term growth. We recognize Novelis as a leader in sustainability, committed to supporting our 2030 World Without Waste Targets.\" Demonstrating the strength of the aluminum beverage packaging market, the majority of the Bay Minette plant's capacity for beverage can is already contracted. Novelis' new, low-carbon facility in Bay Minette will be the first fully integrated aluminum manufacturing and recycling plant built in the U.S. in nearly 40 years and is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs. Boasting an initial capacity of 600,000 tons of finished goods for the North American can and automotive markets, it will be powered by renewable energy, use recycled water and operate as a zero-waste facility. Additionally, Novelis is working toward a goal of achieving net carbon neutrality at Bay Minette. About Novelis Novelis Inc. is driven by its purpose of shaping a sustainable world together. We are a global leader in the production of innovative aluminum products and solutions and the world's largest recycler of aluminum. Our ambition is to be the leading provider of low-carbon, sustainable aluminum solutions and to achieve a fully circular economy by partnering with our suppliers, as well as our customers in the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and specialties industries throughout North America, Europe, Asia and South America.
