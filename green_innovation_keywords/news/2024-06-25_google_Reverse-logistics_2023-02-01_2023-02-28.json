Less so? What happens when that ill-fitting pair of pants or unwanted gadget ends up in the return pile. What some companies are discovering, however, is that the location intelligence they rely on to deliver products to customers efficiently can be equally helpful when goods move in reverse\u2014an increasingly common occurrence. Article snapshot: The \u201cbuy now, return later\u201d mantra of today\u2019s consumer is causing a glut of product returns\u2014and a lot of opportunities for a more circular economy. As consumer spending has grown, so too have product returns, more than doubling between 2019 and 2022 to an estimated $816 billion annually, according to the National Retail Federation and Appriss Retail. While returns can be a convenience for consumers, they\u2019re less convenient for company balance sheets and the planet. Some returns can be resold in stores, off-loaded to discount resellers, or donated to charity, but the rest often end up in incinerators or landfills, according to a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed by a pair of University of Tennessee logistics experts. That creates about 6 billion pounds of landfill waste and 16 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the authors said, citing a study by returns-management company Optoro. Frustrated by the financial losses and environmental degradation created by returns, some companies are eyeing a circular economy approach\u2014one that connects them with interested buyers or manufacturers that can create something new from what\u2019s been returned. Connecting Product Returns with Sources of Demand One challenge of reverse logistics is that there\u2019s far less predictability about where returns will go than there is in a typical supply chain. What can make the process clearer is a smart map that reveals the location of products and their potential destinations. For goods that will end up back on store shelves, GIS technology can capture real-time location information from inventory management systems, indicating which stores in the retail network need certain products. For returned goods that can\u2019t be sold in store, a smart map can show facilities that take donations or resell returns. Then there\u2019s the opportunity to convert returns into new products through upcycling. At a time when supply chain disruptions have left companies scrambling for key components, materials can be harvested and used to make repurposed furniture, apparel, and other goods. That circular economy practice aims to lengthen a product\u2019s useful life, reduce waste, and preserve\u2014even revive\u2014natural systems. As noted in a recent WhereNext article: From an environmental perspective, the consequences [of disposal] are increasingly significant, impacting air, water, and soil resources that underpin the economy. For business executives, trashing products that could be repurposed and resold violates a basic tenet of profitability: never leave value on the table\u2014or in this case, at the dump. One company is using GIS technology to manage the circular economy for plastics. By assigning plastic products a unique digital identifier, the company can use a smart map to trace each batch from the point of collection to the recycling facility and beyond. Such transparency helps manufacturers validate net-zero achievements while giving consumers confidence that their purchases are supporting the circular economy. Pinpointing Supply Chain Links in Proximity Once a company identifies organizations interested in buying returns, planners can use location intelligence to better route the products. GIS software identifies logistics routes that minimize miles traveled and carbon emissions, whether by ship, train, truck, or plane. GIS specializes in complex analysis and coordination, helping companies like FedEx orchestrate the movement of spare parts to keep its planes airworthy and minimize waste in the system. Establishing the links that turn product returns into circular opportunities is inherently a geographic pursuit. Ultimately, this geography of reverse logistics can help build a circular economy, increasing both sustainability and profitability. Photo by Sigmund","filter_flag":1}

This Thursday, the denim label plans to host a one-off \u201cEPR hotline\u201d where it will provide insight from its years centering circularity. The event comes as the European Commission plans to propose EPR regulations in June and the Netherlands prepares to implement its own EPR policies in July. Mud, however, has prioritized reverse logistics for years, collecting old jeans and recycling them into new products. In a typical year, the company estimates it receives back between roughly 10,000 and 15,000 pairs of old jeans. In 2021, that total surpassed 11,500. The self-described \u201cfirst circular denim brand\u201d also offers free repairs for customers participating in its \u201cLease a Jeans\u201d concept. Though Mud has not received \u201clarge numbers\u201d of repair requests\u2014the service only extends to the first year of a lease\u2014the company views its denim leasing program as one of its \u201cmost successful strategies,\u201d corporate social responsibility manager Lea Landsberg said. \u201cThe idea behind offering jeans for lease is to move towards an economy based on experiences rather than possessions,\u201d Landsberg told Rivet. \u201cWe want to show people that you don\u2019t have to be the owner of a product to still enjoy that product. This shift in mindset appeals to many, especially the younger generation. They are aware that the jeans are not with them forever. It also increases the awareness that the materials from which the product is made have had a life before and will have a life after they are done wearing it.\u201d Mud is currently trialing a more extensive repair pilot in Amsterdam and Utrecht, the Netherlands. The prospective program would allow any customer to repair their Mud jeans for free. Launched at the end of last year, this service has facilitated 65 repairs so far, Landsberg said Monday. Though measuring the impact of these repair services is difficult, she said customer feedback has suggested these repair services extend the jeans\u2019 lifetimes by several years. \u201cRunning a holistic take-back scheme has also taught us a lot about efficient reverse logistics and circular design,\u201d Landsberg added. \u201cThrough feedback from our logistics partner and our recycling partners we have been able to create a well-functioning system. By taking this approach for several years, we have also been able to increase the amount of recycled denim we use.\u201d Ultimately, however, Mud has learned to accept that circularity will come at a higher price. \u201cUsing recycled cotton is still more expensive than using virgin cotton,\u201d Landsberg said. \u201cWe have learned to stick to our values and continue doing what we think is important anyway. Meaning: taking back old jeans for free and recycling them into new jeans, despite the higher costs.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

According to data from Rebound, UK retail returns were 26% higher in November 2022 compared to the same period the year before. Similarly, Salesforce noted a surge in returns, citing a 63% increase in returns year-on-year for the holiday period just gone. Rebound suggests that inflation and the cost-of-living crisis could be a factor in rising return rates, with consumers exhibiting greater caution over spend, as well as impulse buying on Black Friday (before deciding to return). Previously, the retail industry has focused on making returns as fuss-free as possible.. Now, however, the high cost of returns is becoming impossible to ignore \u2013 both to retailers and the environment. Optoro estimates that it costs an average of $33 or 66% of the price of a $50 item for retailers to process a return, with costs stretching from processing to discounting and liquidation losses. The high cost also means that most items end up in landfill rather than being re-stocked. Optoro states that, for 2020 alone, returned inventory created 5.8 billion lbs of landfill waste, while shipping of returns emitted 16 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Consequently, the retail industry has started to re-think its approach. Many companies are either looking for ways to make it harder for customers to make online returns (via charges or limits on regular return), or conversely, even more convenient to return items in physical locations. Promoting resale and peer-to-peer returns Only 20% of retail returns are reported to be defective, meaning that the majority of items are returned for other reasons. For clothing and apparel, this is often due to items being the wrong size or fit, or because the customer has bought multiple items with the intention of returning a part of the order (a practice known as \u2018bracketing\u2019). However, a common misunderstanding is that all non-defective items will make their way back into retail stock to be resold, but the reality is that most do not. Technology companies such as Greenlist are aiming to alleviate the issue by offering retailers new ways to handle returns, such as peer-to-peer. The company\u2019s tech plugs into Shopify websites, enabling customers to select items that other customers want to return. Essentially, instead of sending returns to the retailer, customers can send them directly on to each other for a discounted price. Canada-based start-up, Frate, offers a similar business model, also using QR codes to create shipping labels for customers selling on their unwanted goods. Other technology solutions are aiming to help retail brands retain revenue by encouraging exchanges rather than returns. Return management company Loop does this by offering customers one-click exchanges on retail sites, as well as additional incentives such as bonus credit and free shipping. As well as helping to retain the cost of the initial purchase, the idea is that exchanges create a more positive experience for customers, which in turn is more likely to generate loyalty and fewer returns in future. Peer-to-peer returns can also be made on third-party resale marketplaces like eBay, Depop, and Thredup, but in certain instances, retail brands are creating their own resale sites to combat returns. One of the most successful examples of this is Patagonia, which pledges never to dispose of returned items, instead selling them on its Worn Wear marketplace, which also buys back old clothes for repair and resale to drive a circular fashion model. Worn Wear also encourages in-store drop-offs in exchange for store credit, too, to further encourage a sustainable approach to resale. Educating customers to actively discourage online returns Patagonia\u2019s purpose-driven business model is centred around educating consumers about the environmental cost of over-consumption, ultimately encouraging them to buy less. While it is a rather radical approach \u2013 and one that is only successful due to Patagonia\u2019s commitment in other areas, such as charitable donations and sustainable materials \u2013 other retail brands are also taking heed and actively educating customers on what the impact of returns might be. In doing so, retail brands are able to justify charging for returns, which many more are hoping to introduce without negatively impacting the customer experience. A number of brands including New Look, Moss Bros, and Mountain Warehouse have all recently introduced charges for online returns. Interestingly, research suggests that consumers are largely accepting of this, as long as they are offset by additional value and convenience. A Loop survey of 1,000 consumers found that 70% of respondents would be willing to pay for premium returns experiences. Loop defines \u2018premium\u2019 in this context as an experience that \u201celevates consumer convenience through features like at-home item pickup, package-less return drop-off, or initiation through a QR code.\u201d Essentially, any elements that promote time-saving or that streamline the return experience. Another strategy to win consumer favour is to offer transparency with regards to when and what items will go on sale, which can prevent customers from the practice of returning items and re-buying them at a cheaper price. Glossy reports how brands Universal Standard and Kopari did this ahead of Black Friday last year, effectively enabling customers to plan ahead and intentionally buy only once. Elsewhere, when the cost of processing a return is more than the item itself, some large retailers have allowed customers to keep items instead of returning them. Walmart, Target, and Amazon began with this policy during Covid-19 to help deal with supply chain issues, but have since kept it as part of wider customer service strategies. Pet retailer Chewy is similarly well-known for its approach to returns, often telling customers to keep or donate items but refunding them anyway. In doing so, Chewy is able to foster a positive customer experience and drive brand loyalty. Optimising reverse logistics \u2013 curbside returns, no queues, and paperless While fewer returns is the end-goal, the issue is never going to disappear entirely, so it\u2019s vital for the process to be as frictionless as possible. This can also be beneficial for retailers, with 92% of consumers saying that they are more likely to buy from a retailer again if the returns process is easy. One way to optimise reverse logistics \u2013 which refers to the process of sending items back through the supply chain \u2013 is to offer free returns to stores or third-party pick-up locations, where technology is driving additional convenience for customers. Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom now offer curbside returns to encourage returns to stores, meaning that customers don\u2019t even have to leave their vehicle in order to do so. Target has even trialled the option of adding a Starbucks order for curbside pick-up, further incentivising customers to use the service. Nordstrom in particular has seen success with its Norstrom Local stores, which are inventory-free locations dedicated to services such as pick-ups, alterations, and returns (to both Nordstrom and other retailers). Crucially, Nordstrom says that returns made at its Local outlets are processed faster than its main stores as well as online, ultimately increasing the chances of the retailer being able to resell the items. Elsewhere, Amazon is making the process more convenient by offering box-free returns, so that customers can return their unpackaged items to any participating Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, Kohl\u2019s, or UPS Stores, and return their item by scanning a QR code. Other retailers are also investing in store technology to ease the burden of returns. Marks & Spencer, for example, launched digital click-and-collect capabilities in 78 UK stores in 2022, enabling customers to return items without the hassle of having to queue up. Additionally, M&S has launched mobile-optimised returns, which it says reduces pain points, \u201csuch as the need to visit third party courier websites, use a printer, and find the right paper summaries amongst your orders.\u201d With returns remaining a big issue for retailers, finding innovative ways to deter customers from online returns \u2013 or at least re-direct them into physical locations \u2013 is likely to be the way forward.","filter_flag":1}

The integrated system delivers fast wireless speeds over a wide area. The announcement is the latest example of the company\u2019s leadership position in providing network service providers (NSPs) with the latest\u201a\u2014 and most innovative\u2014 products for the connected home market. \u201cWith Falcon 5G, VANTIVA addresses two distinct market opportunities. It is an ideal product for mobile operators that have made significant investments in the 5G spectrum and want to accelerate and maximize returns on those investments. FWA offers these NSPs an opportunity to introduce new residential services and generate new revenue streams,\u201d said Ashwani Saigal, Vice President of Broadband and Video CPE at VANTIVA. \u201cFalcon 5G also creates new opportunities for integrated fixed and mobile operators. They are now in a position to extend their broadband services to underserved residential areas that do not have access to cable or fiber infrastructure,\u201d he said. The Falcon 5G complements and expands on the innovations introduced last year when the Cobra 5G premium indoor CPE and the 5G Omni outdoor CPE were launched. The Falcon 5G, for instance, pushes 5G traffic to the C-band of the spectrum, improving indoor 5G signal reception and significantly boosting uplink speeds while enabling whole-home Wi-Fi coverage in a more compact eco-friendly form factor. Falcon 5G harnesses the company\u2019s breakthrough Indoor5G\u2122 technology, which allows the reception system in the gateway device to self-optimize by automatically configuring its internal antennas to ensure the best reception from operators\u2019 towers. The CPE also leverages Power Class 1.5, which boosts the transmission power by 3 dB. This allows operators to improve uplink speeds for FWA users. More importantly, it enables NSPs to address up to 40% larger areas around their base stations and connect more homes with 5G. The Falcon 5G addresses connectivity and performance issues created by the weakening of 5G signals as traffic passes through the walls of homes. The single-unit CPE can be easily self-installed by subscribers with the help of the NaviGate5G\u2122 iOS and Android mobile apps developed by VANTIVA to optimize the position of the 5G gateway in the home. NaviGate5G\u2122 determines the available towers location in the end users\u2019 vicinity and guides them to position the device at the optimum place. This self-service technology removes the need for NSP-technician installation visits, reducing the time and resources that are typically associated with \u201ctruck rolls.\u201d The latest Wi-Fi 6 technologies have been integrated into the CPE to ensure high-quality connectivity throughout the home. VANTIVA engineers have placed Wi-Fi antennas at the top of Falcon 5G tower design to bring true 360\u00b0 performance. In addition to enabling speeds and coverage that supports high-quality video streaming across multiple devices and high-speed connectivity for smart homes and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, VANTIVA is addressing global demand for greener, more sustainable, products. The company has thoroughly simplified Falcon 5G\u2019s electrical architecture. As a result, the overall size of the Falcon 5G is 45% smaller and has reduced operating power consumption by 35% compared to current products available in the market. The form factor reduction means that the number of gateways flowing through the international supply chain in shipping containers increases by 47%, further improving the carbon footprint profile of the product. Additionally, the company\u2019s mechanical designers have maximized passive convection to remove the need for cooling fans. In terms of materials, 95% of the plastic parts in the Falcon 5G gateway are comprised of recycled resins. The product is designed for easy reverse logistics, reducing the costs associated with refurbishing and recycling. The packaging, made of brown recycled cardboard, is plastic-free.
