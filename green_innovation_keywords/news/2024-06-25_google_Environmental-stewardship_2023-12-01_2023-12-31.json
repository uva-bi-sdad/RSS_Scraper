Photo by Paul Carter There are countless stories that are a mouse click away that slam golf and everything it is about, from how they allegedly waste water to poisoning the soil with pesticides and fertilizers to handling animals that root in the soil. The reality is few if any of those stories perpetrated by mainstream media are based in fact, and superintendents are far ahead of the curve when it comes to environmental stewardship. To that end, when it comes to communicating the sustainability efforts of a golf, the best choice to convey the message is in the mirror. \"For me, it's vitally important to show the world and our community that we are stewards of the land,\" said Paul Carter, CGCS at The Bear Trace at Harrison Bay in Harrison, Tennessee (at right). \"We sit on 660 acres and we maintain 125 of that. Three-quarters of the property is the residence for the wildlife here. It's their home, we just come out here to play. \"We have to be conscious of what we do on the property and the only way to let people know what we're doing is to tell our story.\" Stewardship is something Carter wears on his sleeve at Harrison Bay. The property has been certified in the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf since 2008, and the course became known around the globe 12 years ago when a video camera perched atop a tree showed the parenting skills of bald eagles to viewers around the world. Since then, visitors, many of them non-golfers, descend on Harrison Bay each winter to get a close-up view of the eagles in their natural habitat as well as the golf operation at work. The eagle cam will return next year after taking a year off to update the set up with new equipment. \"We have the Friends of Harrison Bay State Park who monitor our bluebird boxes, and every Tuesday after the eagles hatch we open the 11th hole for people to photograph and view the eagles,\" Carter said. \"We do that for about three months, those are people who never play golf. They get to see us maintaining the golf course, and we stop and talk to them because we're spokesmen for the golf course. We try our best to put that out there by inviting the community on the golf course and see what we're doing. \"Being in front of people and telling our story is vitally important.\" In Greenwich, Connecticut, Jim Pavonetti, CGCS, is a mouthpiece for Fairview Country Club as well as a handful of other private clubs in the town. Earlier this year, Pavonetti was named a winner of the GCSAA Environmental Leaders in Golf Award at Fairview, which has been a certified Audubon property for 13 years. This year was the ninth time Pavonetti has been an ELGA winner since 2006. He submitted his work at Fairview for a sustainability award given by the Greenwich Sustainability. Fairview Country Club in Greenwich, Connecticut. Photo by Jim Pavonetti Although he did not win the award, Pavonetti did not walk away empty handed. \"I didn't get it, but I got invited to be on the committee,\" Pavonetti said. \"Now, I get to represent golf and the interests of eight private clubs in one town.\" The committee includes a diverse cross section of Greenwich residents, including engineers, local leaders and concerned citizens. \"It's nice to have a voice,\" Pavonetti (at right) said. \"And if they're going to pass an ordinance that would affect golf, I can try to change that or at least talk to them about it.\" Pavonetti sees his place on the committee as an avenue to communicate what he and other superintendents in Connecticut do for the environment. \"This is me getting out of my comfort zone,\" he said. \"This is the opposite of me, but I'm doing it, and when I speak, everyone stops talking and they listen to every word.\" Indeed, others on the committee recognize Pavonetti's expertise. A woman on the committee who is committed to keeping natural grass fields throughout the town comes to him for advice as a turfgrass expert. Among Pavonetti's goals while on the committee is to promote smart water use among non-golf constituencies. \"My focus is protecting water quality and water conservation,\" he said. \"You can drive through my town or your town and see sprinklers running in every office park when it's raining. Golf courses aren't doing that. It's residents of the town are doing that.\" Pavonetti says not to discount the importance of government outreach efforts. \"Some of the most important things in my New York and Connecticut days were to go lobby and sit with legislators, explain some of the bills that were coming up and how they were going to affect golf, and how those bills may or may not be based in science. Legislators are pressured by the public, or the media. If they approve a new pesticide, there are those who will turn it around with no education even though new products are 10 times safer than the old ones that are less desirable. \"Politicians promise voters, especially on Long Island, that they won't allow any more pesticides. That sounds great to a homeowner, but those decisions are not educated decisions.\" That's why, as Harrison Bay's Carter says, it's best to look within to communicate what you do. \"Nobody tells your story better than you,\" Carter said. \"So, don't let anyone else tell it for you.\"","filter_flag":1}

Novonesis means \u201ca new beginning\u201d and derives from the Greek word \u201cgenesis\u201d. The name reflects a new era of biosolutions where innovation in biological sciences and technology will offer solutions to solve some of the biggest challenges facing humanity. \u201cNovonesis reflects where we came from, what we can achieve, and what we will become together.

A name that reflects our immense commitment to making biological solutions play an even bigger role in our planet\u2019s future,\u201d said Cees de Jong, chairman of Novozymes. The announcement of the name marks an important milestone towards uniting the two companies. The name \"Novonesis\" is supplemented by a brand identity inspired by the world of microbiology. Progress on closing the combination The merger approval process continues to progress as planned, and the closing is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2024 following regulatory approval. The name Novonesis will be used and gradually implemented once the proposed combination is completed. Until final merger control approvals are received, and the proposed combination completes, Novozymes and Chr. Hansen will operate as a completely separate companies. The combined group will have a global network of more than 23 manufacturing sites and close to 40 R&D and application centers that employ around 10,000 talented and purpose-driven employees.","filter_flag":1}

This strategic move underlines the company's unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability and aligns with the broader industry shift towards eco-friendly practices. A cornerstone of Ineos Inovyn's ambitious journey towards carbon neutrality is Biovyn, an innovative bio-attributed PVC that made its debut in the market in 2019. Positioned as a pivotal element in the company's sustainability initiatives, Biovyn holds the potential to evolve into a carbon-neutral and net-zero solution. Its versatility is evident in diverse applications across various sectors, ranging from automotive and construction to medical and fashion. In response to the imperative for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, Ineos Inovyn introduces Neovyn, a novel PVC range distinguished by a substantially reduced carbon footprint. According to the company, Neovyn achieves an impressive 37% reduction compared to the European industry average for suspension PVC, translating to a lower carbon footprint of 1.3 kilograms CO2 per kilogram PVC. The production of Neovyn will draw on sustainable initiatives implemented by Ineos Inovyn, including improved access to renewable energy, process electrification, and the production and utilization of renewable hydrogen. Positioned as the new standard for low carbon footprints, Neovyn aims to empower converters to advance their carbon roadmaps by reducing scope 3 emissions and offering products with smaller carbon footprints. Running in parallel with Neovyn, Ineos Inovyn introduces Recovyn, a product line meticulously designed to enhance recycling and circularity while minimizing non-mechanically recycled plastic waste. Comprising 100% recycled carbon feedstock, Recovyn caters to customers seeking to augment their recycled content while meeting stringent technical, quality, and regulatory requirements. The adaptability and versatility of Recovyn, Biovyn, and Neovyn are underscored by Ineos Inovyn, emphasizing their potential as drop-in solutions. These products undergo rigorous certification processes by independent third-party organizations such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Plus (ISCC Plus), providing assurance of their sustainability credentials. Arnaud Valenduc, Business Director at Ineos Inovyn, articulates the company's commitment to maintaining industry leadership by continually introducing innovative products that respond to the urgent need for emission reduction and circularity. This commitment aligns seamlessly with the broader industry trajectory towards a sustainable and net-zero economy, showcasing Ineos Inovyn's proactive role in driving positive change on a global scale.

(BAL), a prominent player and one of the largest agro-input manufacturers in India, has executed a strategic investment in Kashmir Chemicals and acquired 99% stake in the company. This move is aimed at expanding its manufacturing capacity in response to the growing market demand for branded agrochemical products and formulations. On October 20, 2023, a Reconstitution Deed of Partnership was formalized, retroactively effective from September 16, 2023, and duly registered with the competent authority in Samba. Kashmir Chemicals is situated in Phase 1 of the Industrial Growth Centre in Samba and registered with the District Industries Centre. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art machinery spread across 16 kanals of leasehold land allocated by J&K State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. The company specializes in the production of pesticide formulations, including emulsified concentrates, wettable powders, and granules. The former partnership company was equally shared between Shyamanand Sharma and Pardeep Kumar Jain, with an annual turnover of approximately Rs. 100 crores and a healthy profit margin. During their board meeting on September 2, 2023, the board of directors reached a resolution acknowledging the escalating market demand for branded formulations. To address this demand, the company recognized the necessity to augment its manufacturing capacity. In evaluating potential solutions, such as in-house expansion and a greenfield project, the board noted the time constraints, estimating a minimum of 15-18 months and the risk of missing business opportunities. Given the current commitments of the company's existing partners to other business ventures, Kashmir Chemicals extended an invitation to BAL to enter into a partnership to facilitate the seamless operation of the manufacturing unit. Subsequently, the board decided to invest in Kashmir Chemicals by acquiring a 99% stake in the partnership, alongside the participation of the existing partners. This strategic move is expected to significantly contribute to BAL's expansion of formulation manufacturing capacity, resulting in an approximate addition of Rs. 350 crores to its overall returns. BAL has also been granted a 20-year patent for their innovative creation \"Synergistic Granular Herbicidal Composition for Paddy.\" The company intends to introduce this one-shot herbicide in the upcoming Kharif season under the brand name \"Orisulam\". With a strong focus on research and development, BAL is dedicated to sustainable agriculture practices and environmental stewardship. Currently, BAL has 7,000 MTPA and 30,000 MTPA technicals and formulation manufacturing capacity, respectively, through three of its manufacturing plants in Gajraula, Greater Noida, and Jammu & Kashmir. BAL currently has more than 5,200 distributors in India and retains an impressive portfolio of 450+ formulations and more than 115+ technical manufacturing licenses.","filter_flag":1}
