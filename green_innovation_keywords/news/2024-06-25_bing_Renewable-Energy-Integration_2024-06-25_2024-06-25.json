Simultaneously, a diverse array of Chinese cultural experiences and performances were carefully curated and tailored for the esteemed guests, providing them with an immersive opportunity to actively participate and gain a profound understanding of the rich tapestry of Chinese culture. Integrating the renewable sector will pave the way for a visionary future. Currently, as the world moves towards environmental sustainability, renewable energy is expected to become increasingly viable and cost-effective compared to fossil fuels. \"The total energy transition investment now exceeds fossil-fuel supply investment,\" said Sisi Tang, Head of China at BloombergNEF. \"By 2050, renewable sources will be the dominant force in global energy generation, accounting for 81% of the total energy mix in a Net Zero Scenario.\" However, Sam Wilkinson, Director of Clean Energy Technology at S&P Global Commodity Insights, emphasized that clean electricity alone is not enough. Apart from solar energy and energy storage, hydrogen will play a crucial role in decarbonization, underscoring the need for a diversified approach to renewable energy to ensure a sustainable and reliable supply. Innovative and safe renewable technologies are emerging as a prominent trend One key topic at the summit was technologies enabling renewable energy integration. Jack Gu, Vice Chairman of Sungrow and President of PV & Storage BG, concurred with Tang on the growing global confidence in renewable energy and the role of innovation in driving the industry forward. Sungrow is dedicated to exploring customer needs and providing reliable product safety and innovation guarantees, especially in utility-scale solar and energy storage systems with vast development potential. At the summit, Sungrow demonstrated a large-scale burn test of its PowerTitan liquid-cooled energy storage systems. Under DNV supervision and live broadcasts from US fire safety agencies and global energy providers, the test verified the systems' superior fire resistance and flame retardancy, maintaining structural integrity and preventing fire spread. Three adjacent cabinets remained unaffected, setting a new safety standard for the industry. Distributed solar and storage enter a new era With an increasing focus on renewable energy, distributed solar and storage systems are experiencing growth and progress. These systems, typically installed on rooftops or near energy consumption points, provide an efficient way to generate and store renewable energy. According to Cormac Gilligan, the global distributed solar market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by factors such as decreasing installation costs, technological advancements, and increasing awareness of renewable energy's environmental benefits. Behind-the-meter energy storage installations are also increasing, enabling customers to better manage their energy consumption and reduce grid dependency. Sungrow is committed to leading the transformation of distributed solar and storage systems. We invest in research and development to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and safety of our products. Our hybrid inverters, batteries, liquid-cooled energy storage systems, power optimizers, and EV chargers showcase our commitment to innovation and safety. During the event, esteemed guests representing ZEN Energy, Truxco AB, Penso Power, Marubeni, and AMEA Power graciously shared their perspectives on cutting-edge technologies and their applications in large-scale scenarios. Meanwhile, Sungrow's distributed partners, comprising Solar Juice, IBC Solar, POwR, and ARB, engaged in a lively exchange of ideas on the dynamic and evolving landscape of distributed solar energy.
