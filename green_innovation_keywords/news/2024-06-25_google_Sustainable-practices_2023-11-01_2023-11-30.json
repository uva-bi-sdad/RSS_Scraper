With the goal to support a healthy planet, the partnership will leverage each company's unique, world-class expertise to incentivize, measure and verify the progress of carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture practices under a new carbon credit verification standard. FoodChain ID The food and agriculture industry currently contributes over one-third of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations. However, less than 1% of carbon credits on the market are sourced from agriculture.1 As consumer awareness of the industry's role in accelerating global warming has grown, food companies have responded with more sustainable products and product claims. In fact, on-pack carbon emission contribution claims for new products grew at 33% CAGR between July 2018 and June 2023,2 making such claims one of the fastest growing sustainability claim categories in food and beverage. In response to the claim proliferation, the carbon credit verification partnership is designed to increase measurement transparency and accountability for sustainability progress and carbon credit offsets in the agri-food supply chain. Additionally, the carbon credit verification partnership incentivizes farmers to invest more in regenerative agriculture practices while complying with European Union deforestation-free regulatory requirements (EUDR). Finally, by combining the program with other farm-level audits, such as Organic (EU, USDA and others), GLOBALG.A.P., RTRS, RSPO, Bonsucro or ProTerra, the program offers efficiencies for farmers. The first joint programs have launched with close to a thousand farmers in Brazil to implement deforestation-free, regenerative practices. ReSeed, with its AI-powered digital ledger transparency platform, will collect and process data for carbon credit measurement protocols to allow monetization and incentivization for farmers deploying sustainable practices in the field. ReSeed's team will also leverage their legal and technical knowledge to validate carbon estimates under international standards and provide field technical assistance to sort eligible farmers based on sustainability standards for farming activities. FoodChain ID, with over 25 years of experience in global sustainability certifications, will serve as the exclusive verifier for the carbon credit partnership under ISO 14065 accreditation. FoodChain ID's independent technical experts will perform yearly audits of farm practices under international sustainability standards, adding third-party credibility to the measurement of carbon sequestration in soil. Dr. Heather Secrist, Senior Vice President, Technical Services Americas at FoodChain ID, comments: \"FoodChain ID is proud to partner with ReSeed as the exclusive third-party verifier for this breakthrough partnership which incentivizes the agri-food supply chain to adopt more sustainable practices. Together with the recent launch of our new global standard for Regenerative Agriculture Certification , today's announcement affirms our commitment to contribute to a sustainable and healthy planet, while supporting the livelihood of farmers and a transparent agri-food supply chain.\" Zak Zaidman, Co-Founder and President of Partnerships of ReSeed, comments: \"Incentivizing and supporting farmers to steward carbon through regenerative farming practices is crucial in the pursuit of a healthy planet. The carbon credit verification partnership announced today with FoodChain ID as the exclusive, independent, third-party verifier increases transparency and trust across the global agri-food supply chain. ReSeed will continue to work closely with global brands and their supply chain to invest in sustainable and regenerative practices to secure the future of both their business and the planet.\" Ivy S.

One recent Oxford University study found that diets rich in plant-based foods reduced greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water pollution by 75 percent compared to high meat-consuming diets. This research complements a study published around the same time by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that individuals following an environmentally sustainable diet were 25 percent less likely to die during a follow-up period of more than 30 years than those with less sustainable diets. And dietitians across the United States, a new survey found, are ready to put these changes in motion. Getty The 2023 Sustainability and Food Insights Survey, jointly conducted by Food + Planet and Today\u2019s Dietitian, revealed a profound eagerness among dietitians to embrace sustainability in their professional practices. A staggering 90 percent of dietitians acknowledge the need to be involved in advocating for sustainable food systems, yet they encounter significant barriers that hinder their ability to effectively do so. \u201cWe know that dietitians are trusted voices in their communities, so they have great opportunities to educate people about making sustainable food choices,\u201d Planet + Food Co-Founder Sharon Palmer said in a statement. \u201cThis could result in a tremendous impact on planetary and human health.\u201d Barriers to advocating for sustainable diets Planet + Food was founded in 2020 by four registered dietitians\u2014Palmer, Sherene Chou, Kate Geagan, and Chris Vogliano\u2014to empower healthcare professionals to be leaders in promoting sustainable food systems. \u201cAs co-founders, we really came together around this idea that sustainability was vitally important to the future of our profession, our food system and our collective well being as a planet,\u201d Geagan tells VegNews. \u201cAnd we believed there was an opportunity (and a hunger from many, especially those coming up in the profession now) to catalyze open access resources, learning, and collaborative exchange to help our profession meet this moment,\u201d Geagan says. Marko Jan\/Getty Despite this recognized potential, the survey, which gathered insights from 1,161 registered dietitians (RDs) across the US, indicates a gap between dietitians\u2019 aspirations and their current practices. While a resounding 95 percent believe their profession should be actively involved in advocating for sustainable food systems, 42 percent report not incorporating sustainability into their work consistently. The primary obstacles? The survey found that an overwhelming 98 percent of RDs encounter barriers to advancing sustainable food systems in their practice, with 30 percent citing lack of access and affordability as the top barriers. Information gaps are also significant, with 21 percent acknowledging a lack of knowledge as a barrier. \u201cIn addition, the survey showed that dietitians are not up to speed on some of the evidence-based factors related to sustainable diets,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt is clear that empowering dietitians with sustainability training is a key strategy for advancing sustainable food systems that nourish both people and the planet.\u201d Adobe Confidence in providing sustainability guidance is another concern. More than two-thirds (69 percent) of RDs do not feel confident or are neutral about advising on sustainable food choices. Specific areas where RDs feel least knowledgeable include agriculture practices and environmental impacts of food choices, ethical labor and climate justice, and culturally inclusive guidance. Empowering dietitians to be sustainability leaders Interestingly, nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of RDs believe that sustainability should be formally integrated into the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Getty However, there exists a disparity between RDs\u2019 beliefs on sustainable diet practices and evidence-based global food-based dietary guidelines, particularly in ranking the impact of various sustainable practices. \u201cRDs bring so many skills that are needed for this great transition we are in, and are ideally situated across many sectors to be powerful levers for change\u2014at the community, healthcare, retail, CPG, innovation, policy, media, research levels and more,\u201d Geagan says. As the scientific community continues to publish research that points to the health and environmental advantages of promoting a plant-based diet, Gegan and her team are working to close these gaps for dietitians in moving the needle forward. \u201cOur mission is to empower one million health professionals with sustainability by 2025,\u201d Geagan says. \u201cAnd a key part of this is shining a light on the RDs who are doing great work in this space: from culinary dietitians to community leaders, from RDs designing global sustainability wellness policies for foodservice companies to those tackling community food waste or food justice.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The shopping hauls serve to spotlight one of many contradictions in the world of sustainable fashion: while consumers increasingly say they want more sustainable products, they\u2019re not shopping like that way. Indeed, even as survey after survey reveals increasing investor and consumer preference for eco-conscious and socially responsible garments, companies like Shein continue to grow market share by selling $12 synthetic halter tops with short life spans. A survey of more than 20,000 people published by consultancy Bain & Company earlier this month reached the conclusion that consumers around the world are willing to pay 12 percent more for sustainable products. Another recent survey from NYU Stern Centre for Sustainable Business asserted that sustainable brands are growing at twice the rate of traditional labels. And a Harvard Business Review article written by Deloitte consultants concluded that retail is \u201cfast approaching [a] tipping point\u201d where shifts in consumption patterns give truly sustainable brands a real edge. But as they do every year, shoppers are expected to drop billions on new stuff this Friday, hunting down bargains with little care for sustainability credentials, making clear that the reality on the ground bears no resemblance to the sunny findings that populate consumer surveys. ADVERTISEMENT The following are five factors that explain the chasm between surveys and actual consumption. Poorly Constructed Surveys Consumer surveys are useful tools for surfacing basic information. For example, do you own a backpack? How old is your backpack? How much did you pay for your backpack? Questionnaires that seek to understand consumer motivations are far less helpful \u2014 people rarely give illuminating, or even truthful, answers to questions looking to understand why and how they shop. According to brand consultant and professor Mark Ritson, this is \u201cpartly because they will give you a false answer to impress you; partly because it depends on the other tradeoffs that they might have to make; partly because by question 42 you might as well be asking them in Klingon. But mostly because they simply don\u2019t know the degree to which it influences them.\u201d Intention vs Action In brief, people don\u2019t do what they say. There is a clear intention versus action gap when it comes to consumer sustainability purchasing surveys. Indeed, according to Kantar, a global data insights and consultancy, 92 percent of people say they want to live a sustainable life, but only 16 percent are actively changing their behaviours in order to do so. When it comes to fast fashion, the intention versus action gap persists. More than half of the 46 percent of the British population who say that they avoid buying fast-fashion products bought something from a fast-fashion retailer last year. An Ill-Defined Concept Even for consumers who legitimately seek to align their purchasing with their intentions, buying \u201csustainably\u201d can be next to impossible. After all, how would one determine what constitutes a \u201csustainable\u201d shirt or pair of shoes? Is a product\u2019s sustainability based on durability, wears per garment, water usage, carbon emissions or eutrophication? How should each of these factors be weighted? Is the data that underlies claims reliable? Just last year, the Norwegian Consumer Council sanctioned Norr\u00f8na and H&M for using the fashion industry\u2019s most accepted assessment tool, the Higg Index, in their consumer communications, causing an industry kerfuffle. In turn, US, UK and EU government agencies are working to tighten regulations governing \u201cgreen claims.\u201d Even so, the underlying complexities (including industry reliance on a multi-tiered, global, shared, opaque supplier base) and tradeoffs inherent in fashion production conspire to make a simple definition of sustainable fashion elusive. ADVERTISEMENT Vested Interests The authors of surveys touting the ascension of sustainability have commercial interests that benefit from their findings. For example, between 2019 and 2020, Bain & Company completed over 500 consulting projects for clients that were focused on sustainability. They also own (or are equity holders in) a bevy of related sustainability service providers, including Persefoni (carbon accounting), Ecovadis (ratings), Sylvera (carbon offsets) and Jupiter (carbon risk analytics). New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Sustainable Business receives some funding from corporations that promote sustainability or have their own sustainability practices. Like Bain, Deloitte has a sustainability consulting service and a growing practice focused on disclosure and reporting of environmental, social and governance data. A Flawed Premise Finally, the selling of sustainability has become so pervasive that the proposition itself often goes unquestioned. That is a mistake. How is it that buying ever more \u201csustainable\u201d fashion products will ever result in a planet that is more sustainable? Where did we get the idea that \u201csustainable\u201d practices such as resale or circularity will slow the purchases of new products, especially when brands are in the business of pushing new dopamine-induced satisfaction? Different from the declaration of the Deloitte consultants, I see evidence of tipping points related to planetary boundaries far more clearly than tipping points in consumer behaviour. Kenneth P.

But unlike other foods grown in the tropics such as palm oil, coffee and cocoa, coconut trees are not associated with the same level of deforestation. That is not to say that coconut production is free from unsustainable practices. Coconut plantations have been linked to biodiversity loss, and according to Gregory Bardies, executive director of the Sustainable Coconut Partnership, farmers are \u2018trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty\u2019. The recently launched Partnership is on a mission to wipe out unsustainable practices in coconut production by establishing best practices, impact programmes, and harmonising industry requirements for supply chain partners. An industry-led partnership for social and environmental sustainability \u200b The Partnership was founded by food and beverage majors ranging from Barry Callebaut to Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Ferrero, AAK and Upfield. Affiliate members include NGOs Earthworm Foundation, Kaleka and Proforest, as well as traceability tech company Satelligence. Coconut is a versatile fruit, with food and beverage brands using its water, milk, oil and flesh in products ranging from chocolate\u200b to coconut water. More than 60m metric tons of coconut are estimated to be produced every year, much of which is for coconut oil. Although the Partnership officially launched this year, the initiative was first discussed back in 2019 while Bardies was working in sustainability at Barry Callebaut. Beginning to investigate sustainable practices in coconut production, Bardies noted there was \u2018very little\u2019 public information about other companies\u2019 methods. \u201cThere was also very little sustainable certified product,\u201d \u200bhe told FoodNavigator. Conducting due diligence exercises revealed signs of an \u2018impending crisis\u2019 in coconut supply chains, particularly in social sustainability. Most coconut farmers are smallholders, and at an advanced age. The next generation wants to move off the farm for a perceived easier life, explained Bardies. \u201cBecause farmers are not rejuvenating their farms, they\u2019re trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty. They\u2019re amongst the poorest farmers, especially in Asia.\u201d\u200b Most of the world's coconut oil from from the Philippines and Indonesia. GettyImages\/Everyday better to do everything you love And its not just about social sustainability. Potential environmental sustainability risks also exist, with research\u200b suggesting coconut production poses a threat to biodiversity, particularly to vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, and plants. \u201cPotential environmental risks are much, much less than for some of the other supply chains like palm oil. But nevertheless, they are things to consider and monitor.\u200b \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worthwhile and valuable for the sustainability of the industry and the wellbeing of millions of people in the environment to advance on sustainability. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d\u200b The Sustainable Coconut Partnership became a formal entity in 2021, with the platform officially launching earlier this year. Deforestation: Why is there less in coconut than palm oil?\u200b So why, if produced in a similar tropical climate to other foods linked to deforestation such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, is associated deforestation significantly less for coconuts? One reason coconut production is considered more sustainable lies in its farming structure, whereby the vast majority (up to 98%) is smallholder driven. Smallholder coconut farmers own between two and four hectares of land, meaning their approach to farming is less intensive and industrialised compared to some other supply chains, Bardies told this publication. Another reason more directly linked to deforestation is that coconut trees are considered more productive over an extended period, suggested the executive director. Oil palms are productive for around 25 years, whereas coconut trees can be productive for more than 60 years, we were told. \u201cIn palm oil\u2026there is a constant need for more, more, more. In coconut, there is much less of this.\u201d\u200b That is not to say that demand for coconut is not growing, it is. Production is \u2018barely keeping pace\u2019, stressed Bardies. And not just for the food industry: coconut is used to produce soap, laundry detergent and cosmetics, as well as biodiesel. Coconut by-products \u2013 notably the husk \u2013 can also be used in other projects, for example to product charcoal or construction materials. A vasty majority (98%) of coconut farming is driven by smallholders. GettyImages\/cherrybeans Bardies does not see greater biodiversity risk in coconut cultivation compared to other crops, and actually sees opportunity for more\u200b sustainable practices given cultivation practices. \u201cIn coconut production you can spread out the trees and grow forestry much more easily than in other supply chains\u2026\u200b \u201c[As to] biodiversity, we cannot say there is zero risk. We are quantifying a number of those risks, but the common understanding is that [unsustainable nature of coconut production is mostly linked to] farmer poverty and social issues.\u201d\u200b Partnership upgrades charter with assurance scheme\u200b In improving the sustainability of coconut production, the Partnership has set out three main impact areas: increasing smallholder farmers\u2019 income; enhancing supply chain traceability; and preventing deforestation & climate change. In 2020, the Partnership received more than 100 inputs from various stakeholders engaged directly or indirectly in coconut supply chains to develop an industry-wide Sustainable Coconut Charter. The ambition was to set a global benchmark for sustainable coconut origins. The first charter set out principles and ambitions for sustainability programmes, explained Bardies. \u201cIt was a guidance for sustainability programmes. We were seeing that a number of sustainability programmes in coconut were targeting a little bit of traceability, maybe a little bit of environment, but not comprehensively addressing all the pain points and issues in the supply chain.\u201d \u200bWhile the first charter sought to change that, it offered guidance only. Upon realising there remained \u2018holes in the racket\u2019, the charter has been revised to be \u2018much more comprehensive\u2019. Unveiled this year, the charter now includes an assurance scheme. \u201cWe are also looking at creating market transformation, which the first charter didn\u2019t allow,\u201d \u200bexplained Bardies. Looking to supply chains, for example, the charter not only offers guidance for companies to act on the ground, but also for ways to act as a \u2018responsible company\u2019 to create enabling conditions for change. Through these new principles and ambitions \u2013 covering guidance, chain of custody, traceability, reporting, and implementation \u2013 the Partnership aims to build out a new assurance system, which Bardies described as a \u2018stepwise approach to existing certification schemes that aren\u2019t showing any signs of picking up in the market\u2019. The decision came from consultations with stakeholders: 75% of those offering input consider it crucial the charter have a new, coconut specific assurance system. The Partnership\u2019s assurance system is designed to be more \u2018inclusive\u2019 than others on the market, which include certification, to encourage as many industry players to join as possible. The assurance system is designed to publicly recognise Members\u2019 progress in sustainability. As to whether the assurance system could also lead to eco-labelling opportunities to help better promote companies\u2019 work in sustainability, the jury is still out. When coconut often makes up less than 5% of a finished food product, it will have to be decided whether communicating that it was responsibly sourced, on-pack, is worthwhile.","filter_flag":1}

To this end, our experts are working on optimizing secondary and transport packaging and the associated logistics. We want to replace the linear economic model of \"produce, use, dispose\" and keep materials in the material cycle for longer. \u2081 With the exception of products where components or residues may affect recyclability or contaminate recycling streams. We are convinced that we need strong partnerships to drive sustainable development. It's not just about making our business more sustainable, but helping our customers and stakeholders comply with regulatory requirements and achieve their own sustainability goals. That's why we work with customers and suppliers in strategic partnerships along the entire value chain to jointly design and develop efficient sustainable solutions. Pernille Lind Olsen, CSVP Packaging & Consumer Goods at Henkel For a sustainable economy, the recyclability of packaging is an important lever for making resources reusable several times over and transferring them to new products. After all, eliminating packaging completely is not a solution either \u2013 it protects the quality and performance of our products and enables safe use and disposal. In line with the 12th Sustainability Development Goal (SDG), which calls for sustainable consumption and production patterns, our experts at Henkel are rethinking packaging concepts along the circular value chain \u2013 for Henkel and for the industry. Our packaging expertise reaches back to 1922 when we first started producing paper, cardboard and packaging adhesives for our own use. What started small, has since developed into a global success story, shaping industries and consumers\u2019 lives through the decades. Today we are applying our know-how to enable intelligent packaging design for the circular economy and to reduce both packaging material and waste with the help of sustainable solutions. Here we show how Henkel Adhesive Technologies creates sustainable industrial solutions and thus contributes to the circular economy, using five examples. 1. Debonding for recycling processes appropriate to the material Establishing sustainable practices is important at home and in industry \u2013 and can start with proper waste separation. Products and packaging can only be recycled in a material-friendly way if we separate the individual materials from one another \u2013 at home, for example, this means separating the aluminum lid from the plastic yogurt pot before throwing both into the recycling can. But separating different materials is not always quite as simple as with the yogurt pot. Multilayer flexible packaging in particular presents a challenge. This is where the so-called debonding process helps in waste processing. Debonding makes it possible to separate different materials that are not suitable for joint recycling and thus provides the basis for reusing and recycling product parts. Together with the start-up Saperatec, our experts at Henkel Adhesive Technologies have developed the Loctite Liofol solution specifically for recycling to enable debonding at the end of the value chain. In combination with the Saperatec process, this solution allows multilayer packaging to be separated from one another again, so that after separation the individual materials made of PE, aluminum and PET can be sorted and returned to the value chain as recyclable materials. EPIX technology gives shipping bags increased functionality by using lightweight cushioning material instead of bubble wrap to create an impact-resistant package without increasing the weight of the product. 2. More paper, less plastic \u2013 with EPIX and KeelClipTM Plastic packaging is often preferred to paper packaging because it is more robust against environmental influences and thus better protects sensitive products. Our experts at Henkel Adhesive Technologies have made it their business to design adhesive solutions that replace plastic and promote sustainable packaging alternatives \u2013 such as EPIX and KeelClipTM. From shipping bags to paper straws to food packaging, EPIX technology makes paper a true alternative to plastic for popular disposable materials. EPIX extends the functionality of paper by adding features to paper products such as barrier properties, thermal insulation, and resistance to mechanical impact. For example, paper packaging with EPIX is better protected against water and grease penetration. The improved thermal insulation properties also make the technology highly suitable in the production of takeaway beverage cups: Double-walled cups offer higher temperature resistance for both hot and cold beverages thanks to EPIX. Best of all, paper packaging with EPIX can still be recycled. KeelClipTM, a solution developed by Graphic Packaging International (GPI) using adhesive technologies from Henkel Adhesive Technologies, also proves that it doesn't always have to be plastic. KeelClipTM represents a sustainable option for the outer packaging of beverage cans. The technology not only reduces plastic, but also saves CO 2 emissions in the life cycle of the packaging. Unlike plastic films or plastic rings that otherwise hold beverage cans together, with KeelClip this task is performed by recycled and recyclable cardboard \u2013 supported by our adhesive solutions. KeelClipTM can replace plastic film and plastic rings in the multi-packaging of beverage cans, increasing the recyclability of the packaging and reducing plastic waste. 3. Bio-based adhesives for more environmentally friendly food packaging Functional, safe and sustainable \u2013 that's how we want packaging in the food industry to be. The Technomelt Supra Eco hotmelt adhesive developed by our adhesives experts not only meets the strict packaging guidelines for food, but also has a significantly reduced carbon footprint. The adhesive solutions in the range are made from up to 98% biomass and can be used for a wide range of packaging. The carbon footprint of the Technomelt Supra Eco range and its raw material sourcing are also fully traceable. This helps not only us, but also our customers to keep track of their CO 2 emissions, so that together we can drive a sustainable industry. And without compromising on the performance of the adhesive product. A win-win solution for the packaging industry and sustainability. 4. Gluing instead of wrapping In logistics, it is common for goods to be stacked in large paper cartons on wooden pallets to be prepared for transport and storage. To ensure that the goods can be transported safely within the supply chain, the cartons are often wrapped with a plastic film. This prevents the goods from falling off the pallet during transport or storage. Our adhesives experts have found a solution to reduce this film consumption in palletizing by up to 90%. The Technomelt Supra PS Hotmelts adhesive solution from Henkel Adhesive Technologies can be used to secure cartons to each other and to the pallet \u2013 making safe transport and storage no problem. Only 0.15 grams per carton is required and the adhesive remains stable even in very hot or cold conditions \u2013 ideal for temperature differences in supply chains. This eliminates the need for conventional stretch film, which is usually wrapped around the cartons on the pallet and saves a lot of plastic. Another advantage? Subsequent depalletizing is not only easier, but also takes far less time. In addition to cartons, the adhesive is also suitable for PET bottles, metal cans and many other goods, making it a real gamechanger in the packaging industry. Our adhesive solution Technomelt Supra PS Hotmelts is a sustainable alternative to stretch film and can reduce film consumption in palletizing by 90%. 5. Achieving goals together \u2013 with the cyclos-htp institute Together with our strategic partners, we achieve our sustainability ambitions much faster. One example is our partnership with the cyclos-htp Institute (CHI). The partnership enables us to link two critical components of the packaging and consumer goods value chain: Adhesives and coatings, and recycling expertise. CHI specializes in testing, evaluating and certifying packaging for recyclability. CHI's certification process determines the recyclability of packaging based on the amount of recovered recycled material (paper fiber) available to produce the starting material (new paper). Building on the generally accepted CHI test methods, it acts as a neutral testing and certification body and, through its partnership with Henkel, can offer its services to a broader customer base. CHI's rigorous evaluation and certification thereby supports the performance and sustainability of product concepts. With the institute's expertise and advice, we can further improve our packaging and adhesive solutions, integrate the recyclability of our products and solutions earlier in the design process, and strengthen sustainability in the industry together with our customers.","filter_flag":1}

Traditionally applied to art ownership, the concept of provenance also uniquely resonates within the realms of architecture and construction. Christel Force, associate research curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, beautifully articulates the essence of provenance as the collective biography of lives of objects and their owners, wrapped into one. \u201cObjects have a life from the time they are created,\u201d she says. \u201cWith provenance tracing their biography.\u201d Provenance challenges architects to not only envision the finished product but to also consider the origins and narratives entwined within the material selection process. The repercussions of overlooking provenance in architecture reverberate in the contemporary landscape. This places a responsibility on the architect to avoid the use of materials and processes whose provenance encodes violence and degradation in our built environment. It emphasizes the importance of material choices and labor practices that will yield beautiful architecture while simultaneously catalyzing positive transformation for people and planet. Ethical Sourcing and Labor Rights: A Moral Imperative At the heart of this architectural evolution lies a crucial mandate\u2014to ensure that the materials used are untainted by forced labor. The Design For Freedom initiative, spearheaded by Sharon Prince and Grace Farms, and of which MASS Design Group is a working group member, underscores this critical dimension. Designers, manufacturers, and builders must be acutely aware of the human cost embedded in building materials, recognizing that without a conscientious approach, they risk perpetuating a legacy of abuse within the very materiality of their constructions. James Kitchin, our Performance & Provenance Director, aptly notes that \"Simpler products have simpler stories.\" To untangle the complexity of modern building components, we must demand greater transparency in product sourcing, including detailed ingredient lists and material origins. Initiatives leveraging blockchain and synthetic DNA could emerge as powerful tools supporting traceability and empowering stakeholders to unravel the intricate journey of each construction element. Social and Environmental Impacts: A Holistic Perspective Adobe Stock\/Tupangato Inextricably linked to the discussion of provenance are the social and environmental impacts of architectural decisions. Carrara marble, a globally recognized example, serves as a cautionary tale. Although it has been quarried since Roman times and cherished by the likes of Michelangelo, the region of Carrara is today one of Italy's poorest areas. The marble quarries, controlled by a handful of family businesses, witnessed a precipitous increase in extraction, and the toll of this is apparent in the local erosion of mountains, pollution of rivers, frequent destructive flooding, and decline in biodiversity. Additionally, while the region was once the site of not just extraction, but immense craftsmanship in transforming the marble, most of those skilled roles have been globalized, further commodifying the material and diminishing the economic value that was once retained in the region. Once a symbol of artistic elegance, the region's exploitation for marble extraction has left scars\u2014environmental degradation, economic decline, and a loss of local craftsmanship. A holistic view of marble sourcing makes evident that with our material choices, architects must evaluate each decision as an opportunity for a restorative and regenerative future. While reducing the carbon footprint through low embodied carbon materials is undeniably crucial, it is only a fraction of the broader ethical imperative we face. Championing Craftsmanship: A Cultural Shift Iwan Baan, Courtesy MASS Design Group Craftsmanship, often overshadowed when we only look at the variables of cost and performance, emerges as a beacon in the provenance narrative. Understanding the origins, energy invested, and the human touch throughout the material's lifecycle catalyzes a cultural shift. More than harm reduction, but a cultural shift in celebrating the stories within materials and products, and acknowledging human ingenuity. To transcend moral imperatives, we must celebrate provenance. By narrating the stories embedded within the materials and products we employ and by championing their craftsmanship, cultural significance, and ecological stewardship, we can define a new architectural value proposition. In MASS's inaugural project, the Butaro Hospital in northern Rwanda, the abundant but typically overlooked scoria volcanic stone became a testament to the power of provenance and craftsmanship. It was a material ubiquitous in the region but undervalued, and piled on the sides of the road where it was a nuisance and impediment to farming. During the process of adapting it for use as a facade, we met Anne Marie Nyiranshimiyimana, a trailblazing woman in the male-dominated construction industry. Her mastery of working with the stone in this way led her to form a cooperative that has since replicated and refined this approach in various projects across the country, where she now trains and mentors other women and men masons. Through her expertise, she is responsible for training and inspiring the next generation of masons and is improving the local material and construction supply chain in her county. Here we see the use of local materials providing an opportunity to unlock potential to provide both a unique sense of place and inspire great value due to the craft of their assemblage. Towards a Provenance-Driven Future: Crafting Spaces with Purpose Iwan Baan, Courtesy MASS Design Group Provenance invites us to engage with our surroundings, honor local cultures while creating new livelihoods, and champion sustainable practices. It empowers us to design spaces that transcend superficial aesthetics, embody ethics, and foster planetary restoration. Good provenance has expansive meaning and across disciplines it includes responsible material extraction that respects planetary boundaries, leverages the use of native species to promote biodiversity in our landscapes, and maximizes the potential of adaptive reuse for our existing buildings. In MASS\u2019s largest project to date, the Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture , sourced regenerative materials locally meant 90 percent of the budget was spent within 500 miles of the site. Building with earth, stone, timber, terra cotta fired with agricultural waste, and a variety of fibers minimized embodied carbon, while working with over 85 different cooperatives and artisans allowed most of the building materials and furniture to be built with the same principles of provenance. Chris Schwagga, Courtesy of MASS Design Group Centering provenance is a paradigm shift. By caring deeply about the origins of our materials and products, we can create spaces that resonate with the values of our time. Provenance reminds us that architecture encompasses more than structures; it encapsulates stories, cultures, and the legacy we bequeath to future generations. Demanding good provenance is a manifestation of the commitment to a just, beautiful, and sustainable future.

Supporting our retailers through innovating new products allows us to de-risk the wider group and maintain strong relationships with our major stakeholders as new products made with renewables in a sustainable process are what consumers are increasingly expecting on shelves.\u201d Angelo hopes to expand the orchards and plant the first hectares of a special variety that will only be used for avocado oil. Although their own production is seasonal, Australia has year-round supply and so too does Cherry Creek\u2019s value add supply chain. Representing a new development for industry where products can get shelf space and reliably maintain supply. \u201cOur oil is cold pressed through centrifuge and only utilises the mesocarp of the fruit. Our yields are varying region to region as we learn the national crops oil production nuances\u2019 our nutrient grade and density combined with sensory board results is something to rival the most delicate oils in the premium market. We aim to offer a premium range of edible oils that must achieve high smoke points. Only through a cold pressed process is both the sensory and versatility achieved together in the processing of Avocado oil. Good virgin grade avocado oil must emit a grassy\/mushroom taste much similar to the avocado itself and with emerald green colouring in the oil body.\u201d Avocado oil production was tried in Australia not long after the turn of the century however with a lack of volume to support a commercial scale production it has taken over 20yrs for Australia to grow the orchards needed to sustain year-round supply. \u201cAt this stage we are the only producer at scale however with two more close behind we won\u2019t be the only entrant to the category. With a global shortage in edible oil and the capacity for the oil to remove the lower grade fruit from the market it is a perfect hedge not just for us but all major growing regions in Australia. In 2024 we are aiming to ramp up to 500k\/L per annum. We have achieved a better than expected penetration to domestic supply chains. Access to markets in Australia can be very difficult for local products due to a limited competitive landscape in the grocery sector. Our market being small presents an extra barrier that can make an ROI that much harder as starting slowly in a small market with limited access is a profound risk to any potential processor. We are supporting a slow and steady development of the local market but our main focus is the export for our premium oils. Export presents with existing market demand being unmet and creating opportunity as the consumer is very mature in awareness of healthy eating habits, naturally giving Avocado oil an edge\u2019. \u201cWe have created a biomass energy system that allows the cost of production to remain competitive and utilise fruit that otherwise would not have made it to markets. Fruit that is more cost effective to be sent to the oil plant rather that exacerbate the oversupply by adding lower quality fruits to the markets. We are aiming to prove our model of premium grade fruit only, supporting our retail partners with campaigns that define a brand built on sustainable practices and most importantly guarantees of the highest quality products as it is financially more viable for us to operate this way rather than the traditional method of dumping all fruit on the market together.\u201d \u2018Cherry Creek Estate is looking to further push the boundaries of innovation through a range of Avocado oil infusions that will come to market in early 2024 and challenge the creativity of chefs with an oil capable of maintain versatility at high temperatures and infusing rich flavours at the same time\u2019. Exciting times are still ahead for Australian Avocados\u2019 For more information: Angelo Leonardi [email protected]","filter_flag":1}

This can be achieved by selecting natural materials such as wood and stone, using organic and biomorphic shapes and forms, incorporating plants, adding earthy textures and colours, and maximising natural lighting and ventilation. It can also take the form of indoor spaces being designed so they are connected to the outdoors and nature. Biophilic design is an ever-evolving concept that can extend beyond aesthetics and material choice to sustainable practices, energy-efficient technologies, and sustainable materials. Ultimately, a built environment that offers a connection to the earth and nature has been shown time and time again to have a positive impact on wellbeing. A La Natural Sustainable thermowood specialists Thermory see incorporating natural materials like thermally modified wood as one of the easiest ways to put biophilic design principles into practice. Thermory\u2019s Content Marketing Specialist, Kerttu Raie, says humans evolved in the natural environment, not a human-engineered one, which is why we have an understandable inclination towards nature. \u201cTo counterbalance, we have started using biophilic design principles in urban planning, architecture and interior design as a means to restore our connection with the natural environment,\u201d she says. Thermory uses thermal modification as a way of naturally enhancing wood. The chemical-free heat treatment makes the wood extremely durable and stable for both indoor and outdoor use, giving it a beautifully deep shade and bringing out its natural beauty. Unlike chemical impregnation, Thermory\u2019s thermal modification enhances the wood throughout, not just the outer surface. When used for interior spaces the wood even enhances the acoustic properties of the room. Thermory\u2019s Benchmark ash cladding was chosen for Maidla Nature Resort, a small luxury cabin inspired by wild nature, set in the middle of a forest near a manor house in Estonia. Mari Hunt from b210 Architects designed the cabin in keeping with the natural environment surrounding it. No trees were felled, and the cabin is on stilts due to local floods in springtime. The form of the cladding and the overall look of the building was based on the character of the site. The house is clad with durable thermally modified wooden cladding boards from Thermory, which are perfectly suited for houses exposed to rain, winds and falling leaves and preserve the intended look for a long time. Thermory ash boards were selected as the architect liked its brownish shade, which was emphasised by treating the material with oil. The facade of the building was clad with vertical boards, while the same material was also requested for use horizontally on the terrace. This worked to create the feeling that the house was simply covered with decking. Thermory wood has also been used for the interior, covering the floor of the bedroom and all the ceilings in the house. Using the same material for the ceilings and the facade ties the individual parts of the building together as a united whole, where the architecture and interior architecture are completely entwined. Connecting with Mother Nature Another leading producer of thermowood, Novawood, also recommends thermowood products as a perfect fit for biophilic design. Novawood\u2019s heat treated products originate from sustainably managed forests, emphasising their commitment to ethical sourcing and environmental responsibility. Novathermowood products are sustainable, strong, long lasting, and environmentally friendly. The range includes exterior cladding which helps the building fit in better with its natural surroundings, decking and flooring: The unique colours and patterns achieved through the thermal modification process can mimic the aesthetic of forest floors, creating a grounding and calming effect in the environment. Novathermowood also comes as interior wall cladding, ceiling panels, doors, windows, partitions and screens. The use of heat-treated wood in interior spaces can complement the presence of indoor plants, reinforcing the connection to nature and creating a harmonious environment. Timber manufacturer Big River Group also point to the warmth timber adds to biophilic design and the way it can bring a sense of nature and wellbeing into the built environment. \u201cThe materials surrounding us on a daily basis that offer a deeper connection to earth and nature, such as the natural beauty and uniqueness of wood are being embraced by designers,\u201d Sales and Marketing Manager, Panels, at Big River Group Stuart McGonagle says. \u201cAccording to a recent study, those in environments featuring natural wooden surfaces, reported higher personal mood, clarity, confidence and optimism on average\u201d. He says Big River Group has seen a rise in the use of decorative timbers on walls and ceilings. \u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of timbers with different textures and colours available, that can be utilised to improve the ambience of a venue. What\u2019s more, due to its natural insulation timber reduces internal heat gain in summer and loss of warmth in winter and can store and release moisture which helps to regulate humidity and air quality in an indoor environment\u201d. Warrnambool Library \/ Big River Group Seeing the wood and the trees A smart choice for cabinetry and joinery applications that achieves a natural aesthetic is Big River\u2019s ArmourCab, a new generation of engineered Australian decorative wood panelling. Available in Blackbutt, Spotted Gum and Hoop Pine timber finishes, each with its own natural colour and markings, ArmourCab adds harmonious design and plays an important role in marrying the indoor and outdoor spaces. Big River\u2019s decorative plywood known as Armourpanel is another popular choice for biophilic design thanks to its distinctly natural appeal. \u201cIn maintaining the natural characteristics of the selected wood species, every Armourpanel sheet offers an individual and natural look, with the species\u2019 unique grain structures being preserved so no two sheets look alike,\u201d McGonagle notes. Also available in a range of native species including Blackbutt, Flooded Gum, Spotted Gum and Sydney Blue Gum, its durability makes it ideal for use in hardwearing areas, including flooring, wall panelling, screening, cabinetry, ceiling linings and joinery. Big River\u2019s wood panels were specified for Warrnambool Library and Learning Centre in regional Victoria. Designed by Kosloff Architecture, the space aims to bring education, community, and the arts to the city in a warm and inviting environment. The interior is punctuated by a dramatic timber staircase, which leads up the three levels through a circular void and has been clad in Big River Group\u2019s premium plywood products ArmourPanel and Armourfloor in Blackbutt. \u201cThe warmth of the Big River Blackbutt products with rich tones provides a sense of comfort and connection to nature within the interiors of the project,\u201d Associate Director of Kosloff Architecture Lance Van Maanen says. Scultpform's Australian Ash biophillic design by click-on batten Wood in the workplace High quality timber is recommended for biophillic design by click-on batten, cladding and screens specialists Sculptform. Scultpform says getting the quality right with timber is key for biophilic design as showing off the natural features of timber helps to improve the atmosphere within a space. Scultpform\u2019s battens, screens and tongue and groove cladding can all be made from timber. All can be applied on interiors and exteriors and are perfect to cover walls, and ceilings and create screening within spaces. They offer three species of timber, Australian Ash, Spotted Gum and American Oak, and a range of profiles and coatings to enhance the look of the material. Scultform\u2019s Ash timber click-on battens and tongue and groove cladding feature throughout the multilevel ceilings at The Workshop by Milligan Group, a campus-style business hub in Sydney\u2019s Pyrmont. Designed by Bates Smart, The Workshop showcases a new era of workplace design with 19,000 square metres of office space, seven boutique offices and substantial onsite amenities including retail outlets, childcare, a gym with bike storage and an infrared sauna, a cafe\u0301 and a restaurant. A full-height atrium in the centre of the Workshop creates an open, light-filled environment and visual connectivity between floors Biophilic design is also incorporated with gleaming planter halos suspended at differing levels throughout the void, bringing a sensory element to the interior and emphasising the benefits of indoor\/outdoor connections in the design. The design achieved the highest-level Green Star Rating (6 Stars), through its careful choice of building materials. Another way to bring biophilic design to life is by incorporating the architecturally designed timber wall and ceiling panels by SUPAWOOD. These can be produced in natural and concept woodgrains, as well as textured and natural-coloured finishes. The panels can also be customised and shaped to mimic natural elements like leaves. Castle Towers Shopping Centre \/ SUPAWOOD The footage is grainy SUPAWOOD\u2019s custom-shaped and grooved SUPALINE panels, for example, brought a natural feel to levels 2 and 3 of the podium retail spaces at Castle Towers shopping centre in Sydney. The designer, Buchan, engaged SUPAWOOD to create a decorative but complex paved effect on the ceilings. The panels form a crazy paving design on the ceilings over the thoroughfares on each level. The parts of the ceilings nearer the shop fronts are lined with SUPALINE in a neutral matt SUPACOLOUR finish. The areas on the outer edge are slightly raised and in a SUPALINE custom-grooved pattern reminiscent of the veins of leaves. These outer areas are finished in a woodgrain laminate. Raw unfinished backing boards were used as a base under the shaped panels. To frame the inner perimeter, custom curved MAXI BEAM lightweight beams have been applied. These have been tastefully contrasted with the other finishes in a metallic brushed finish. Follow the pattern Flooring specialists GH Commerical design many of their products with biophilia in mind, purposefully incorporating colours, textures and patterns found in the natural environment. Their Lichen 1.5 and Lichen Community collections exemplify biophilic design. \u201cInspired by the idea of \u2018nature\u2019s carpet\u2019, the design team looked at natural assemblages of rich multi-hued, multi-textured lichens from extreme climates as the foundation for the collection, particularly how they grew on rock and bark. GH Commercial used their Pattern Perfect tufting technology to produce textures and forms on the surface of the carpet, which look authentic and capture nature\u2019s impact on our senses and wellbeing. When the team at New Zealand commercial interior design business, Outline, needed to create a learning space that was both beautiful and inspiring for Saint Kentigern Schools, they chose GH Commercial\u2019s Lichen Community collections for the flooring. The brief for the project was to achieve an interior vision based on sustainability and the wellbeing benefits of biophilic design. The light-filled central atrium with its \u2018social staircase\u2019 links two floors of classrooms, collaborative learning zones, and a staff room that also serves as a professional development area and function space. Below: Saint Kentigern Schools \/ GH Commercial The Lichen 1.5 Collection of carpet planks presented ideal flooring to meet the brief, with the selection of Micro and Macro Bloom 1.5 in an array of colour offering a distinctive pattern with complementary pops of yellow, purple, blue, aqua, and white. Teamed with neutral Groundcover 1.5 in 949 Rock face, the overall effect was cohesive while also creating wayfinding paths and distinguishing separate learning zones. Biophilia in the interior For interior specialists, Baresque, Wallcoverings play a central role in biophilic design as they can artfully replicate the textures, colours, and patterns found in natural materials like wood, stone, and water. These designs capture the gentle flow of fluid motions through deep texture, intricate patterns, and geometries. Nature plays a central part in the design of the recently refurbished IDES restaurant, a cool and innovative fine dining venue in Melbourne. The food and dishes at IDES take their cues from the local environment and seasons, with the fit out of the original restaurant also echoing this theme. It\u2019s no surprise then that nature played a huge part in influencing the design vision for the new project, with earthly finishes such as wood, stone and linens all featuring. Like all bustling venues, addressing the acoustics of the space was also high on the priority list to ensure an intimate experience for diners. In the private dining room, Baresque\u2019s fabricated acoustic wallcovering Zintra Sticks was selected in Merbau, a colourway inspired by real woodgrain. The covering which features on the walls and ceilings complements the original timber elements and adds a sense of warmth and intimacy. In keeping with the theme of natural finishes, Baresque\u2019s Cork Cobra wallcovering which is inspired by snakeskin was installed on the adjacent walls. This decorative wallcovering features gold highlights which are beautifully accented by the wall lights. Overall, the newly refurbished IDES is a moody, intimate space with elegance and connection to nature expressed in both the aesthetics and gastronomic experience. Designers and manufacturers of facade systems, Fairview, say they have seen an increased focus on incorporating natural elements, materials, and patterns into designs to create spaces that foster wellbeing, productivity, and a sense of harmony with nature. \u201cWe have also seen an increase in the integration and usage of nature analogues, certainly specific to woodgrain finishes. Powder on powder technology allows architects and designers a choice of finishes that mimic not only the natural patterns, but also textures of wood,\u201d Head of Marketing at Fairview Kristy Welsh says. She says Fairview see biophilic design as extending much more broadly beyond aesthetics and material choice. \u201cIt is an area that is ever evolving as new sustainable practices, energy-efficient technologies and sustainable materials continue to emerge. It is an exciting space to be in, and for Fairview we are committed to contributing to biophilic design and ultimately the circular economy \u2013 not only in terms of how our products are manufactured and with what, but also in terms of their lifecycle and end-of-life use. It is a constant learning curve\u201d. Fairview collaborated with builder and installer, Northpoint Residential Projects to complete the exterior facade of 1 Pretoria Parade Hornsby. This project features more than 7,220 of Argeton\u2019s Argelite terracotta tiles in Salmon Pastel and a large range of accessories. Biophilic design becomes sophisticated Argeton\u2019s Argelite panel is a product made of natural clay, preferred for its stylish simplicity and low weight. Argeton is a natural terracotta facade system, available in a wide range of colours, textures, profiles, and glaze options for exquisite and unique designs. With sunscreen and rainscreen properties, frost and moisture resistance, impact, weather, and UV resistance, Argeton is an eco-friendly option that allows for creativity while ensuring resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Australia\u2019s largest supplier of certified engineered bamboo and rattan House of Bamboo see biophilic design as much more than just a trend, but \u201can essential part of sustainable and emotionally resonant architecture\u201d. \u201cIn 2023, biophilic design has become more innovative, sophisticated and integrated into architectural practice. Thankfully it has become an essential element of sustainable architecture, as it not only enhances the quality of life for people but also aligns with the growing focus on environmental stewardship and holistic wellbeing in the design and construction industry,\u201d House of Bamboo\u2019s Marketing Manager Ash Guven says. By incorporating biophilic design with House of Bamboo materials, architects and designers are well positioned to achieve Green Star ratings, particularly in the Indoor Environment Quality and Management categories. For projects targeting LEED certification, their products can contribute to achieving high levels, ranging from Gold to Platinum. Feeling WELL The biophilic materials also play an important role in projects aiming for WELL Building Standard and can secure valuable credits for UK-based BREEAM certification, particularly in categories like Health and Wellbeing, Materials, and Land Use and Ecology. House of Bamboo has a wide selection of products available to suit biophillic designs from stylish and sustainable Cross Laminated Bamboo panels to woven bamboo decking, featuring natural bamboo heat-treated for improved hardness and durability. Made without toxic glues or plastics and pre-oiled with premium Woca oil. Ultimately, biophilic design isn\u2019t just a trend but a timeless way of designing that taps into our innate connection to the natural world. It is about bringing the feel of mother nature into our built environments to create a welcoming and nurturing atmosphere evoking a sense of calmness to those that using the space.

What inspired you to start ColossusTex, and what was the initial vision for the company? After dedicating more than 12 years to the textile industry, with experience spanning various sectors such as yarn spinning, fabric manufacturing, garment production, and distribution, I came to realise that many companies in this field face a common set of challenges. These challenges have kept the textile industry as a low-margin business with substantial uncertainties. My inspiration draws from the success of new-generation mobile app solutions in more complex sectors like transportation, food delivery, and finding specialised technicians. I firmly believe that if we can provide a swift and effective solution to mitigate these challenges for companies and employees in the textile industry, it will significantly enhance the industry\u2019s global performance. Our vision is to create a robust model that fosters sustainable trade practices, deploys effective marketing strategies, and facilitates global access to unique textile products. With our tagline, \u2018Revolutionizing Textiles for the Future\u2019, we aspire to be a game-changer and trendsetter, ushering in a new era to replace traditional trade practices in the textile industry.

ColossusEDGE is driving financial inclusivity and efficiency, making it a valuable partner for businesses of all sizes in their trade endeavours. Can you share some examples of how the company has contributed to making businesses more sustainable in the long term? The flow of information within the textile industry has historically been constrained by traditional trade practices, with certain cities or countries specialising in specific products while the rest of the world imports these items. This setup often limits the growth of these products because the pricing of imported goods becomes more expensive due to customs barriers. Our strategy is to promote the local production of innovative products in every city or country, provided they have access to the necessary raw materials and technological expertise. For instance, in India, the production of sports shoes was limited due to the unavailability of crucial raw materials for creating shoe uppers. We took an innovative approach by maintaining local inventories in various parts of the country and globally, which has contributed to India becoming the world\u2019s second-largest producer of shoes. We are replicating this successful model in Turkiye and Peru. Moreover, we are applying a similar approach to the blanket and carpet segments, introducing new products that are used in other parts of the world but are rarely seen in other markets. We do not just supply raw materials; we offer comprehensive services, including consulting, execution, and assistance in finding target markets for finished products. By providing these services, we aim to make these businesses sustainable and encourage them to continuously innovate their products, fostering a vision of ongoing improvement. What role does technology play in your supply chain management solutions, and how has it evolved over time? Technology plays a pivotal role in modern supply chain management solutions, and its evolution has been transformative over time. Initially, supply chains relied on manual processes and paper-based systems, leading to inefficiencies and limited visibility. However, with the advent of digital technology, supply chain management has undergone a significant evolution. In the early stages, technology introduced basic automation with the use of spreadsheets and basic software for inventory tracking and order management.

He also talks about the company\u2019s ambitious goal of recycling 20% of its products by 2025 along with the broader sustainability goals. Read the full interview below to learn about ASUS India\u2019s commitment to be the harbinger of change when it comes to environmental protection. Q&A Q. ASUS recently launched the #DiscardResponsibly campaign. Please tell us a little more about how this initiative was conceptualized and what it entails. A. As we are progressing towards a more technologically evolved future, it is also imperative that we step towards setting the premise for a more sustainable technology and future that is built on a well-functional circular economy to curb e-waste. ASUS, since its inception, has been the harbinger of change, be it in terms of introducing state-of-the-art technology or harnessing sustainable solutions beyond manufacturing. Our attempt to reduce the mounting e-waste in the country and globally led to the inception of our #DiscardResponsibly campaign. As the name suggests, this campaign is an attempt to drive awareness amongst our customers to discard their e-waste in a responsible manner. Not just pertaining to creating conversations, we have also initiated a collection service that can be availed when phoning the toll-free number or visiting the ASUS exclusive\/selectstore. ASUS envisions achieving a global recycling rate of 20% for its products by 2025 and we need support from our consumers to achieve this target. With the broader theme of \u201cYou can recycle anything with a plug, battery, or cable!\" we are certain that we will be able to take a meaningful step towards building India\u2019s circular e-waste economy Q. What are the challenges you are anticipating with this initiative and how do you plan to address them? A. While we embark on this CSR initiative, we are fully aware of the challenges that lie ahead. Our commitment to responsible business practices goes beyond mere tokenism, and we understand that scepticism from the public is one of the primary challenges we may face. Many may perceive CSR efforts as mere marketing tactics or greenwashing, which is why our foremost measure to combat this scepticism is to demonstrate authenticity and transparency in every activity we undertake. We will engage in open and honest communication, ensuring that our intentions are clear, and that we demonstrate the tangible impact of our initiatives towards society and the environment. Stakeholder engagement is another vital aspect of our efforts. It's not just about what we do; it's about how we involve our customers, suppliers, and local communities through our initiatives. We value our stakeholders'inputs, involve them in the decision-making process, and demonstrate unwavering transparency in our social impactendeavours. By ensuring that our stakeholders are not just informed but actively participating, we aim to build a stronger, more effective, and more transparent ecosystem. Q. ASUS plans to have 20% of its products recycled by 2025. How far do you think this campaign would contribute to achieving that goal? What are the other steps you are taking in that direction? A. ASUS's ambitious goal of recycling 20% of its products by 2025 is a commendable sustainability initiative. To achieve this, the company is implementing a multifaceted approach that includes product design, recycling programs, and consumer engagement. 1. Product Design: ASUS comes with incorporating eco-friendly design principles, making products more easily recyclable and using materials with a lower environmental footprint. Design modifications that consider disassembly, material recovery, and sustainable sourcing play a crucial role. Ex \u2013 The recently launched ASUS Zenbook S 13 OLED laptop is one of the most environmentally conscious devices available in the Indian market. This product embraces recycled materials in its chassis, employing a high percentage of post-industrial-recycled (PIR) aluminium and magnesium-aluminium alloy in its metal parts. 2. Consumer Participation: Engaging our consumers in the recycling process is key to success. ASUS launches various awareness campaigns, offers incentives for recycling old products, and provides accessible drop-off points for e-waste. The participation of consumers in returning old products is a significant factor. 3. Circular Economy Initiatives: Asus promotes a circular economy approach, where products are repaired, refurbished, or repurposed, which can extend the lifecycle of ASUS products. This not only reduces waste but also minimises the need for new resources. Below are the additional significant measures taken by ASUS to ensure a sustainable future: - RE100 Participation: RE100 is an international initiative launched in 2014 by the Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). ASUS is part of RE100, with a goal to use 100% renewable energy in Taiwan by 2030 and globally by 2035. - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Initiative: ASUS is a founding member of the \"Taiwan Climate Partnership,\" where it aims to identify major climate risks and opportunities, and measure the impact on operations and finances under different scenarios, so as to set management goals, formulate response countermeasures and actions, and systematically disclose the progress and results of response actions. - SBTi Commitment: SBTi (Science Based Target Initiative) is a joint initiative of the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). ASUS is dedicated to science-based carbon reduction targets aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. - RBA Membership: ASUS became a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2018 to take on greater responsibilities as the producer. Asus includes the PAS7000 and SA8000 standards and sets the ASUS Supplier Code of Conduct to strengthen the protection of young and female employees. Q. E-waste disposal is becoming a global challenge. In your opinion, how are Indian companies progressing on this front and what more can they do to address this issue? A. In the fiscal year 2020-2021, India grappled with the daunting task of managing a staggering 3.4 lakh tonnes of e-waste. This challenge is further exacerbated when considering the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which reveals a concerning annual increase of 3% in plastic waste generation. Even more alarming is the escalating generation of e-waste, which reached a colossal 7.1 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 and surged to an astonishing 10.14 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, showing a relentless annual growth rate of 31%. Drawing from the CPCB's report, it is evident that we face a monumental challenge. As conscientious corporate citizens, we fully grasp the urgency of advancing sustainable technology. Thus, our \"Discard Responsibly\" initiative is meticulously crafted to engage and sensitize major stakeholders. It underscores the vital need for a collective effort in shaping a greener future. Importantly, this responsibility cannot be the sole burden of a single organisation; it necessitates a united commitment across the entire supply chain, encompassing every stakeholder in the nation.

A new survey by accounting firm Ernst and Young finds Canadians are buying less and changing the way they eat due to rising concerns about the environment and rising prices of food. The EY Future Consumer Index Survey found 84 per cent have rising concerns about climate change and 96 per cent of Canadians have deepening concerns about inflation. Monica Chadha, EY Canada retail leader, says these concerns will be reflected in the coming festive months when consumption normally ticks up. \u201cAs we head into the holiday season and beyond, we\u2019ll see more shoppers take control and do their research to optimize for both economic and environmental benefits,\u201d Chadha said. In an effort to help the environment, 38 per cent of consumers indicate they\u2019re planning to buy less, the survey found. Fashion accessories were the most popular product category in which consumers are planning to buy less, followed by toys and gadgets, clothing, footwear, and cosmetics. \u201cConsumer products companies can\u2019t ignore the large percentages of Canadians who are changing their lifestyles and consumption habits in response to climate change and affordability concerns,\u201d said Elliot Morris, EY Canada grocery and consumer packaged goods leader. Not only is climate change impacting consumers\u2019 fashion choices, it\u2019s also heavily impacting their grocery bills. Nearly one-third of Canadians surveyed have had to change the food they eat due to climate change impacting prices and availability. Almost half of consumers say they\u2019re planning to order less \u2014 a 15 per cent increase from last year \u2014 and about 40 per cent of consumers say they\u2019re planning to transition meals with friends to at-home dinner parties. Different generations, different actions Both Baby Boomers and Gen Z are taking personal actions with the planet in mind \u2014 but their methods of impact differ. The survey notes while the older Baby Boomer generation is more likely to act sustainably, the Gen Z generation is more likely to spend sustainably. In the survey, Baby Boomers stood out as the best at bringing reusable bags to the store and recycling or reusing packaging. Meanwhile, the younger generations are more likely to pay for sustainable goods and services, as well as check a company\u2019s sustainable practices online. \u201cPeople are more informed now about what sustainability means and have better access to information to assess whether a brand is living up to its promises,\u201d said Morris. \u201cCompanies need to get ahead and respond now by creating new products or reformulating existing ones to make them healthier and more sustainable, so they can protect their profitability and the brand experience.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Amidst this landscape of perpetual transformation, the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector serves as a prime example of relentless development and adaptability. Its success is tightly woven with a resolute commitment to innovation, a driving force behind its consistent growth and relevance in the global market. In this era, innovation is not just a choice but an essential driver for FMCG companies. These companies face ever-evolving consumer preferences, demands, and market trends that necessitate constant adaptation and evolution. Innovation within the FMCG sector extends beyond the creation of new products \u2014 it embodies a holistic transformation of processes, an elevation of customer experiences, and a dedication to sustainable practices. Let\u2019s understand why innovation matters. According to NIQ BASES Innovation Measurement System for FMCG, conducted globally, it has been observed that FMCG companies that record growth in innovation-led sales are 1.8 times more likely to grow overall sales, as compared to companies whose innovation sales are either stagnant or declining. This gap is amplified in home care and personal care categories. Also, food and beverages segments have higher innovation proliferation, making it much more important to stay relevant.

Understanding consumers deeply through data analytics, social media insights, and direct feedback has become crucial for the development of products and services that genuinely resonate. Meeting the rising demand for sustainability, environmentally conscious practices, and products has become a significant focal point for these companies. Integrating eco-friendly materials and sustainable practices throughout their supply chains to reduce environmental impact has become imperative. The infusion of digitalization and technology is shaping the future of FMCG operations. The emergence of e-commerce, mobile platforms, and AI has transformed how companies engage with consumers. It enables personalised marketing, optimised supply chains, and enriched customer experiences. Health and wellness have become paramount as consumers seek products that contribute positively to their well-being. FMCG companies are innovating with natural ingredients, additional nutrients, and personalized nutrition plans to meet these evolving demands. Also, the push for convenience and personalization is driving the creation of single-serve options, user-friendly packaging, and tailored product recommendations, aligning with individual preferences and fast-paced lifestyles. Many FMCG companies are setting new benchmarks through innovative approaches in product development, marketing, and sustainability. Notably, there is a surge in the demand for plant-based alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Pioneering companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have introduced revolutionary plant-based products that replicate the taste and texture of animal-based products, appealing to the growing vegan and flexitarian consumer base. This shift towards sustainable and ethical food choices aligns with the evolving values of today\u2019s consumers. The utilization of technology to deliver personalized nutrition solutions is also gaining traction. Industry giants such as Nestle and Unilever are employing artificial intelligence and data analytics to craft tailored nutrition plans and products that cater to individual preferences. This personalized approach is reshaping how consumers perceive their dietary needs and overall well-being. Moreover, sustainability is a top priority for FMCG leaders such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, dedicated to reducing their environmental impact through sustainable packaging solutions using recycled materials, designing refillable containers, and minimizing packaging waste. Innovation remains the key to success for FMCG companies as consumer expectations evolve and technological advancements unfold. Companies should aim to innovate both at the top and bottom of the price pyramid \u2013 to grow portfolio penetration. In 2023, super-premium products (commanding 1.6 \u2013 2 times of average price) have grown at a healthy 17% growth rate \u2013 which is similar to the growth rate of mass products (less than 0.8 times of average price). Clearly, there is a possibility of growth at both ends of the pyramid. Moreover, when it comes to premium innovations, brands launching such innovations are 1.3 times more likely to grow overall distribution compared to others \u2013 so clearly even retailers seem to love the premium innovations. To maintain a competitive edge, companies must remain agile and adaptable, emphasizing hyper-personalization, and sustainability, leveraging AI and data analytics, embracing new technologies, and collaborating with startups and innovators. By embracing innovation and staying attuned to consumer trends, FMCG companies can adeptly navigate the ever-evolving landscape of consumer goods, ensuring they retain a prominent and competitive position.

This initiative, part of Grab\u2019s pilot project, aims to drive sustainable change, promote recycling, and support Grab\u2019s goal of achieving zero packaging waste in nature by 2040. The RVMs make it easier for consumers to contribute to a greener Malaysia by allowing them to deposit rinsed plastic food containers, aluminum cans, and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. These items will be collected by Asasrama Sdn Bhd, a certified processor, to recycle into raw materials for various purposes, including new products like apparels and furniture fillings. This collaboration underscores Grab\u2019s commitment to proactively seek sustainable solutions and use technology for environmental good. The pilot project, running for six months, aims to encourage greater recycling of plastic waste, aligning with Malaysia\u2019s Plastics Sustainability Roadmap 2021-2030. Grab\u2019s efforts have already led to substantial waste reduction, saving more than 23,800 tonnes of waste and 898 million sets of cutlery weighing 8,088 tonnes in 2022 alone by offering consumers the choice to exclude single-use cutlery from their food delivery orders since 2019.

This agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the HanesBrands Board of Directors, is the successful conclusion of the Company\u2019s previously announced evaluation of a range of strategic options for the global Champion business. HanesBrands has made significant progress in recent years to reignite its innerwear business, increase market share, attract younger consumers, and strengthen its operating model. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company intends to focus on extending its leadership position in the innerwear category and generating above-market growth through continued consumer-centric product innovation and increased investment across its portfolio of leading brands, including Hanes, Bonds, Maidenform, and Bali. Bill Simon, Chairman of the Board said, \u201cFollowing a thorough review of options for the global Champion business with the support of our financial and legal advisors, we are pleased to have reached this agreement with Authentic Brands Group that we believe maximizes value for Champion and best positions HanesBrands for long-term success. Importantly, we believe this transaction will enable the Company to accelerate its debt reduction while positioning HanesBrands to deliver consistent growth and cash flow generation through a focused strategy on advancing its leading innerwear brands and optimizing its world-class supply chain.\u201d Steve Bratspies, CEO stated, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of significant effort by our teams to position all of our brands on the optimal path for the future. Over the past three years, we have taken necessary actions to enhance the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance \u2013 returning to historical gross margins, reducing our cost structure, lowering our debt levels, and generating consistent cash flow. The successful completion of this transaction further simplifies our business, deleverages our balance sheet, and enhances the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance. As we begin the next chapter for HanesBrands, we believe we\u2019re in an even stronger position to further extend our leadership in innerwear, pursue new cost reduction opportunities as we ensure we have the right operating structure in place, and advance our multi-year flywheel to drive strong shareholder returns.\u201d The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024. Subsequent to the closing, HanesBrands will provide certain transition services for Champion, including operating the business in select regions through a transition period. HanesBrands expects net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $900 million, including working capital adjustments and other customary transaction costs and excluding the contingent cash consideration. In line with HanesBrands\u2019 commitment to debt reduction, the Company will utilize all net proceeds from the transaction to accelerate its reduction of debt and expects meaningful deleveraging on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. On a trailing 12-month basis as of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the global Champion business generated approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is net of approximately $60 million of stranded costs. The Company has specific plans to remove all stranded costs within a year of the transaction closing as it completes the transition of the business. The Company intends to classify Champion as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024 and as a result, expects to update its full-year 2024 guidance in conjunction with the release of its second-quarter earnings results. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Evercore are serving as financial advisors to HanesBrands, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Jones Day are serving as their legal advisors.","filter_flag":1}
