Scientists warn this will make it harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change: with the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2013 an intergovernmental body tasked with advancing knowledge about climate change caused by human activities \u2013 says greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly CO2, must decrease 43% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement and escape its most severe impacts. Amid this spiralling carbon crisis, many fashion businesses acknowledge they must play a part in reducing emissions. Estimates vary, but the fashion industry is thought to contribute between 2% and 8% of annual global carbon emissions, according to various reports and estimates \u2013 from the raw materials used, transportation, manufacturing, product use (washing and drying by the wearer) to end of life, when many items are incinerated or sent to landfill rather than recycled. For companies with long, complex supply chains, businesses built on manufacturing and selling new products, reducing emissions is not simple. One of the ways many \u2013 including Aldo and Kering Group-owned Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga \u2013 do so is by carbon offsetting (see box): purchasing reductions in or the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere from third parties to compensate for emissions generated by the business. While this does have some impact on reducing carbon levels, offsets are controversial, critics say they are an apologia for emitting and mean that businesses do not have to change their behaviour, and fraught with challenges. Those wanting to use them should consider a range of factors before doing so, say brands, activists and carbon reduction experts.

Many fashion businesses have been carbon offsetting for years. As the climate crisis has climbed higher up the global agenda, the business case for reducing emissions has become clearer, and standards such as B Corp certification \u2013 for which businesses must prove high standards of social and environmental performance \u2013 more coveted. For example, Marks & Spencer purchased 2 million tonnes of carbon offsets for an undisclosed sum between 2012 and 2017 as part of its Plan A sustainability plan, through programmes such as Unicef\u2019s carbon-offset project, which funded 40,000 fuel-efficient cooking stoves in Bangladesh in 2014, as well as creating more than 150 new jobs for local people who were trained to manufacture, market and install the stoves. Global footwear brand Aldo purchases offsets from clean energy projects in India and China, as well as a forest conservation project in the Amazon. Advertisement Prices and projects vary. Nature-based projects are at the higher end, charging an average of $14.40 (\u00a311.73) per tonne of carbon, while industrial gas destruction projects, which destroy emissions so they are not released into the atmosphere, are among the cheapest. Projects on the lower end of the market can charge less than $1-2 (80p - \u00a31.61) per tonne. Others have started carbon insetting: financing carbon-reducing projects in their own supply chains (see box), such as premium Danish fashion brand Ganni and British luxury label Burberry \u2013 which set up its regeneration fund in 2020 to invest in both carbon offsetting and insetting projects, such as regenerative farming, which can help sequester (remove from the atmosphere) carbon (see box) with wool producers in Australia. Since 2021, M&S has not used offsets to maintain its carbon-neutral status, which it achieved in 2012, instead redirecting funds that would have been invested in offsets into its Climate Innovation Fund set up in June 2022 to support projects in its supply chain and operations. Edzard van der Wyck is co-founder and CEO of British brand Sheep Inc, which sells merino wool knitwear globally, direct to consumer via its website. It is a carbon negative business rather than just carbon neutral(see box), through ensuring products are biodegradable, minimising the carbon footprint of its manufacturing process, and allocating 5% of all revenues to biodiversity projects, with investments vetted by an independent advisory panel of climate change experts. Van der Wyck says offsetting can play a part in the battle against emissions, but warns businesses to be conscientious in which programmes they select. \u201cCarbon offsetting definitely has a place in the market,\u201d he tells Drapers. \u201cIt has to, while [the fashion industry is] still figuring out trying to improve, and industries have to evolve, because things can't simply change [overnight]. The second you carbon offset, [businesses] are immediately vilified [by industry and climate crisis observers], but there has to be a nuanced conversation about it. It\u2019s not black and white \u2013 carbon offsetting is a grey area.\u201d Advertisement However, van der Wyck notes that carbon offsetting is \u201ca bit of a cowboy market\u201d, pointing to some treeplanting schemes as an example of projects that can sometimes do more environmental harm than good: \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable reality. In New Zealand there are tree-planting exercises happening where farmers just plant a certain type of tree in these vast areas, and it's destroying the natural mix [of the environment].\u201d He says this type of project is easy to sell to businesses because the idea of planting trees is straightforward and appealing, and simple to communicate to fashion customers: \u201cBut these are just saplings. They're tiny trees that take years to grow [into mature trees that will sequester large amounts of carbon]. \u201cIt's also getting harder and harder to verify all these projects. Sometimes they happen in faraway countries, or where maybe the auditing is not as strict as it should be or they don't audit it that often. Projects can kind of fall into disarray. It's very hard to know you're actually having a proper impact. You have to actually look at the data that sits behind it. It\u2019s really important to understand the impact of projects that you're investing in.\u201d Ganni\u2019s sustainability director, Lauren Bartley, agrees, telling Drapers that carbon offsetting is an \u201copaque\u201d approach offering businesses limited visibility and control over the schemes from which they purchase offsets. Because of this the Danish brand announced in February 2022 that it was no longer offsetting, and began carbon insetting later that year. She says: \u201cThrough insetting, we can forge stronger partnerships with our suppliers and be the lead investor in our own projects. This gives us full visibility of projects and their impact.\u201d Swiss sneaker and sportswear brand On is stocked in the UK by retailers such Office, JD Sport, Selfridges and Harrods, and opened its first UK store on 10 February, on London's Regent Street. It has a keen focus on manufacturing products with as low a carbon footprint as possible. Ilmarin Heitz, On\u2019s global head of innovation, says that reducing emissions in a business\u2019s own supply chain is essential: \u201cLowering our carbon footprint is an important goal. However, it encompasses much more than carbon offsetting. At On, we believe innovation and sustainability go hand-in-hand. As we envision a future where every On product is fossil-free and is engineered for circularity, sustainability has become a main driver when designing a product.\u201d As well as purchasing carbon offsets from projects developing fibre-to-fibre recycling techniques \u2013 turning textile waste into new fibers for clothing \u2013 it has reduced the use of airfreight from 39% of products shipped in 2019 to 12% in 2020 and continued to hold it at 12% in 2021, and works with its factories in its supply chain to reduce waste and be more energy efficient. The brand is also researching the use of carbon emissions to create a primary raw material for a shoe\u2019s midsole. In September 2022, On revealed the first-ever shoe made from carbon emissions, called Cloudprime. The shoe is made from CleanCloud EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foam that uses carbon emissions as a raw material. Heitz says: \u201cThe beauty of this project is that we capture harmful emissions before they enter the atmosphere, and at the same time we are moving away from [using] fossil feedstock [fuel or raw material for manufacturing made from fossilised carbon products, such as crude oil].\u201d For Tamara Cincik, founder and CEO of Fashion Roundtable \u2013 a thinktank dedicated to driving greater responsibility in the fashion industry \u2013 like Van der Wyck, urges businesses to be wary of ineffective offsetting projects: \u201cCarbon credits are a relatively new market and in a consumerist landscape, there is a danger of carbon offsetting and its schemes being used to meet KPIs while bolstering \u2018green\u2019 credentials. \u201cThere are many fashion initiatives that claim to offset a company\u2019s carbon through planting trees \u2013 an example is where a tree is planted for every order placed. The same trees will be planted in one place at mass. This is known to decrease nutrients from the soil and also impact on the diversity of bacteria that are critical to the balance of soil. \u201cThis [emissions reduction] requires long-term thinking and our research points to the fact that much of the work around carbon offsetting is short-termist. Take the example of Microsoft\u2019s efforts to offset its carbon, by planting trees, which later burned down in a forest fire [in August 2021, in Washington and Oregon, US, a fire destroyed forestry projects used by companies including BP and Microsoft to offset their carbon emissions].\u201d Cincik urges fashion businesses to consider investing in regenerative farming as \u201csomething which goes beyond soil health and instead looks at improving the land instead of causing harm\u201d. She adds: \u201cThis ultimately leads to healthier soil with the capabilities of working towards healthier communities.\u201d Footwear brand Allbirds uses offsets to reduce its carbon emissions, as well as using ocean liner shipping instead of air, working with third-party factories in its supply chain to increase renewable energy use, and using low-carbon materials \u2013 plant leathers with 40 times less carbon impact than traditional leather, and avoiding petroleum-based synthetics, for example. \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018and\u2019 strategy, not an \u2018either\/or\u2019 strategy,\u201d Hana Kajimura, head of sustainability, tells Drapers, of the combination of Allbirds\u2019 offsetting and work on its own emissions. \u201cWe've been a carbon-neutral company since 2019 [certified by Climate Neutral, a non-profit organisation that measures the impact of the carbon dioxide equivalent that brands measure, remove, avoid, and reduce]. We tax ourselves for every tonne of CO2 that we emit, and all of that money goes into a pool. And at the end of the year, we invest in projects that reduce or avoid emissions, to find out what our footprint was in the air. And that's all in addition to very aggressive reduction targets. \u201cIn terms of the specific projects we fund, the first thing we do is purchase renewable energy credits against all of our electricity footprints [more than 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation], to match like for like with that part. And then with what's remaining, we do a combination of projects, but try to invest in nature-based projects as much as possible.\u201d Renewable energy credits generate one MW\/hour of electricity from a renewable energy source for use elsewhere. Allbirds also funds projects in renewable energy and lower carbon farming, such as the Capricorn Ridge Wind initiative, a wind farm in Texas. Kajimura says: \u201cLike anything in the climate crisis, there's no perfect solution. So, yes, you can find companies that are just planting trees and continuing to pollute not doing anything to reduce their footprint. You can find offset projects that aren't doing what they say they should. Of course, there are flaws. But there's also a lot of good. \"My fear is that we throw out all the good with the bad by painting offsets with a broad brush. It's just making sure that all of the projects that we do invest in one are certified to best in class, third party standards, ensuring that the developers of the project have gone through all the hoops to prove that it's going to be well managed and that there are mechanisms in place to control for challenges. And then Climate Neutral is an additional check on top of that offset certification to make sure that we're doing this all responsibly. We're always going to be doing both reducing [carbon emissions] and some form of offsetting. We will just have to buy fewer and fewer offsets.\u201d Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard \u2013 a certification programme for emission reductions \u2013 agrees with Kajimura that verification is critical: \u201cIf carbon markets are to be an effective tool [in reducing global emissions], buyers need to be assured that each credit they purchase is really removing 1 tonne of carbon from the atmosphere. \u201cSome project types are not eligible under the Gold Standard carbon crediting issuance, such as those that could prolong or expand the use of fossil fuels, large hydro restrictions, and avoided deforestation (REDD+) [protecting forests that would otherwise be cleared for use] projects. The reasons vary, but the general rule is that there are too many shortcomings and uncertainties be confident of their impact, and therefore we do not believe these projects should be funded by carbon credits. Credits created from such projects are like the \u2018fast fashion\u2019 of the carbon market: lower quality, produced quickly and with uncertain impacts.\u201d Kim points to projects seeking to make vehicle engines more efficient as an example of those that, while certainly reducing emissions, may have the \"perverse effect of extending the life of the vehicle and incentivise further use of fossil fuel\" - hence Gold Standard does not support them. While carbon offsetting should not be dismissed, fashion businesses wanting to use offsets must thoroughly research programmes if they are to have a genuine impact on emissions, and to avoid doing more damage to the environment or investing in sham projects. They must also simultaneously invest directly into reducing emissions within their own supply chains: the climate crisis will not wait.","filter_flag":1}

Environment Minister, Eamon Ryan, received Cabinet approval today to buy the credits to help comply with 2020 emission targets, with the deadline for compliance being 17 February. The agreement will see Ireland purchase over 4.1 million credits from Slovakia to help meet the 2020 target, at a cost of \u20ac2.9 million. Additionally, Ireland had over 2.9 million credits on hand from previous transactions that were carried out by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The credits are being bought to comply with emission targets within specific sectors of the economy, particularly buildings, transport, agriculture, waste, and some sections of industry. Advertisement EU regulations required Ireland to cut emissions within these sectors by 20% compared to 2005 levels. Under the Effort Sharing Decision, EU member states are required to limit greenhouse gas emissions but there is flexibility on how these targets are met. In particular, the regulations allow for EU states to sell or buy carbon credits from other countries as well as allowing them to carry forward a 5% emission allocation to the next year. Between 2013 and 2019, Ireland had met the Effort Sharing Decision targets and need to comply with the targets by Friday 17 February. The decision to purchase credits from Slovakia comes after both EU member states and politicians reached an agreement to reform the bloc\u2019s carbon market. The plan aims to accelerate emissions cuts, phase out free allowances to industries and targets fuel emissions from the building and road transport sectors, according to a European Parliament statement.","filter_flag":1}

Survcoin, Food For Future and Nash FintechX are run by entrepreneurs who have mobilised blockchain technology in order to tackle entire systems such as food production or money itself, their ultimate aim being to address the climate crisis. Survcoin To what extent is conventional money keeping us addicted to fossil fuels? That\u2019s a question posed by Jean Lasar, founder of Survcoin, a cryptocurrency that rewards decarbonisation efforts. \u201cI believe we need to really interrogate some basics about how society works,\u201d he says, arguing that change at a systemic level is necessary to properly fight climate change. \u201cDecarbonising might well be become much easier if we were able to use other forms of currency--if we were able to organise transactions in a different way.\u201d Part of problem with traditional money, Lasar explains, is that prices don\u2019t contain much information. \u201cPrices only tell you that someone hopes to earn money by selling you this at that price.\u201d Value creation in this context happens simply when a company manages to make money from a manufacturing or commercial process. But Lasar, a former journalist, dreams bigger: his new currency, survcoins, are earned when you can prove that you have reduced your carbon footprint. How does that work? For now, Survcoin is devoted to soft mobility, or trying to incentivise people to use bikes, scooters, trains, buses, etc. instead of cars. Companies, shops or organisations can match the value of something they have--a sweatshirt, a painting, a day off for an employee--to an amount of carbon that travelling sustainably manages to save. Survcoin comes in by verifying that amount of carbon and handling the transaction, using a digital ledger for traceability and transparency. In effect, this enables individual organisations to invest in behaviour rather than more tangible things like technologies or products. Lasar believes that Survcoin is competitive against current decarbonisation incentives like subsidies for green vehicles. \u201cWe reward usage and behaviour rather than ownership,\u201d he points out. Purchases are one-offs, whereas behaviour is ongoing. Asked to clarify whether the concept relies on the organisation to act out of goodwill, Lasar explains: \u201cThere are monetary benefits which an organisation can obtain from using survcoins. A commune can gain a better Climate Pact ranking, for instance, which will result in increased subsidies. An employer who manages to induce more active mobility among their staff will benefit from their enhanced health and assiduity.\u201d There is potential marketing value as well, he adds: \u201cIf you look at how companies rush these days to obtain any kind of green credentials they can get, it makes sense to me that demonstrably stimulating soft mobility among their personnel with the help of a dedicated currency could easily be heralded as a way of assuming climate responsibility.\u201d The startup is currently running a pilot project (\u201cMobiDiff\u201d) in the commune of Differdange, where city employees can earn survcoins if they commute in a sustainable way. With a team of two and about 30 users, Survcoin is still in its beta phase, having incorporated in 2022 as a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019impact societal (societal impact company or \u201cSIS\u201d). One of the next goals, for Lasar, is to get enough users to create critical mass in Luxembourg and check the organisation\u2019s proof-of-concept. Food For Future \u201cNo company on its own--no fund on its own--is going to be able to do this. It\u2019s a lot of people that are going to have to do it.\u201d The \u201cit\u201d here refers, in the broadest possible terms, to solving the climate crisis. More specifically, the speaker is talking about fixing systemic problems in the global food production industry. That speaker is Eduardo Gramuglia, CIO of a new Luxembourg entity called Food For Future. The company\u2019s founder and CEO, Rushank Bardolia, draws attention to the extreme divide between rich and poor regions: in the global north, the discourse revolves around high-tech solutions and wealthy investors; in the global south, there are farmers who don\u2019t even have reliable electricity, let alone access to innovative technologies or financial backing. Gramuglia\u2019s comment also gets at the ethos of the company, which is to empower farmers and their communities rather than (per se) to sell a technological product. \u201cWe are an agriculture company that uses technology,\u201d says Bardolia. \u201cWe are not a technology company that is used by agriculture. That is very important for us.\u201d The company\u2019s ambition is big. Its ultimate goal is to change the climate finance narrative by creating an asset class around regenerative agriculture (as a way to diversify climate funds). Abhimanyu Singh, COO, points out that smallholder farmers are currently completely cut off from the global food industry. How can such a goal be met? Most immediately, Food For Future is seeking to bring innovative technologies to farmers in places like Ghana, where a pilot project is currently underway, in order to digitise the first mile of the food supply chain. This farm-to-factory phase is, in Singh\u2019s phrasing, \u201cwhere the sustainability number game is won or lost\u201d. The transparency offered by blockchain, for instance, will help fight local corruption and secure records of where crops originated. Eventually, it will also enable a platform on which farmers can sell carbon credits on top of their agricultural output. At the same time, the firm wants to bring precision farming to these communities in order to enable regenerative agriculture practices on a large scale, a goal that will involve IoT sensors in the soil, drones and other data solutions. (Precision farming is the practice of using farmland more strategically with the help of analytical tools; regenerative agriculture is a farming practice in which land degradation is prevented and carbon neutrality\/negativity becomes possible.) Realising this vision will take time, however. Bardolia has already been living in Ghana for five years, building trust in the community and getting the early phases of the project off the ground. \u201cImagine,\u201d he says, \u201c\u2026people are wanting to take blockchain to [Ghana]. But 60% of Africa does not have internet.\u201d \u201cDigitally, [the farmers] don\u2019t exist,\u201d adds Singh, pointing out that documentation and records are lacking in Africa. \u201cWhat we are doing differently,\u201d Bardolia continues, \u201cis understanding what is missing on the ground--then bringing the technology to make it actually scalable, usable and affordable.\u201d The project in Ghana is called Green Earth Agro, which began as a startup geared towards responsibly producing and selling palm oil but which, now as a project under the Food For Future holding company, has broadened in scope. Although in the longer term the company wants to take its expertise to countries all over the global south, right now it is still establishing itself in Ghana. Currently, it pays farmers to implement good farming practices that can be tracked on blockchain. \u201cOnce that is verified, and we sell that produce,\u201d explains Singh, \u201cwe give them part of the profits back, enabling a circular economy--and the money goes directly into their crypto-wallets.\u201d Once the farmers start to make more money than before, their trust will strengthen. \u201cChange happens at the rate of trust,\u201d says Singh. The idea is that eventually they will qualify for micro-financing loans with the record of tangible assets they will build. The project is gaining ground, and in the most literal way: it encompasses 1,000 acres of land as of now, with plans to extend to 5,000 in the next couple of years. In Luxembourg, the holding company is currently in its capital-raising stage and is run by just three people: Bardolia, Gramuglia and Singh. Nash FintechX Greenwashing, lack of transparency, lack of awareness, lack of trust, the double-counting of carbon credits\u2026 these are problems that blockchain technology is well-suited to tackling, says Nash FintechX CEO and founder Nida Khan. For instance, companies make claims related to sustainability efforts all the time. Imagine, says Khan, if these claims were put on a blockchain. \u201cThere [would be] a legal proof against them in case they go back on the claim or try to deny it,\u201d she says in an interview. Tampering with the data is hard or impossible, which also makes things like government audits much easier. Khan\u2019s idea is therefore a blockchain-based carbon market. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task,\u201d she says, explaining that her team needed to build the necessary code from scratch, since providers were not ultimately reliable for such a product. In fact, according to Khan, the whole project is novel: \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is completely new. It has not been done before.\u201d There are six other companies worldwide, to her knowledge, who have similar ambitions with carbon markets and distributed ledgers, but Nash FintechX differs in its approach. Whereas her competitors are building new business products (e.g. crypto-tokens) that a corporate client would have to adapt to, Khan explains that her ambition is to integrate those existing processes into the product so as to ease the process. To that end, Nash FintechX works with PDFs rather than tokens. Currently, the norm for businesses is to circulate a certificate of carbon credit as a PDF, so Khan wants to create an NFT of that PDF. \u201cWe can also break the NFT into different pieces,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou can sell each individual part [of it].\u201d That would be useful if a company wanted to resell a carbon credit to two or more buyers; without an NFT, you wouldn\u2019t be able to break it up. The startup has a team of three, plus an advisory panel. It launched in 2020 as a consultancy firm but has since switched to software-as-a-service, and has recently been selected for the EuraTechnologies incubation programme in Lille. Its carbon offset marketplace CNet0, a platform where you can store your carbon offset certificates as NFTs, has recently gone live.","filter_flag":1}

And women-owned and operated businesses are often at the forefront of ethical consumption. It\u2019s a theory that has even threatened women\u2019s success: Women have greater moral reservations about ethical compromises in business. And you know what? We\u2019re simply thrilled that many women business owners are strong in their convictions for a more ethical, just economy. Of course, gender is a complex, personal socially constructed concept, but it has very real implications on how we live, work, and thrive in our society. The systems that keep women from succeeding are the same systems that raise boys and men to prioritize capital over compassion \u2014 and we\u2019re here to celebrate the people who are paving the way to the end of the patriarchy. According to the World Economic Forum, women started 49% of all new businesses in the U.S. in 2021, up 28% from just two years prior. More women are becoming entrepreneurs than ever before \u2014 and businesses owned by Black women represent the highest rate of growth in the number of total women-owned businesses. However, in the U.S., men still outnumber women two to one when it comes to business ownership. We\u2019re here to remind you that you don\u2019t need an excuse like Women\u2019s History Month or International Women\u2019s Day to support a woman-owned business. In fact, we\u2019ve made it even easier to shop from diverse, women-run companies and social enterprises that make the world a better place year-round. Here is the ultimate guide to women-owned businesses \u2014 in fashion, home goods, health and beauty, food, lifestyle, pets, and media \u2014 that give back and do good.
