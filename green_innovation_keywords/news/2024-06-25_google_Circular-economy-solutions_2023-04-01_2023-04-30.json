Through a collaborative effort, Eastman, the United States Automotive Materials Partnership LLC (USAMP), automotive recycler PADNOS and global automotive interior supplier Yanfeng , demonstrated first of its kind plastic recycling from the by-product of shredding end-of-life vehicles. Eastman announces project success with USAMP, PADNOS and Yanfeng for fully circular recycling study in automotive market. New closed-loop technology provides cost-effective options for OEM automakers to create sustainable materials from automotive plastic waste. When automobiles are at the end of their life, metals, tires and glass account for 80%\u201390% of the materials that can be recycled through traditional mechanical recycling streams. The other 10%\u201320%, referred to as automotive shredder residue (ASR), consists of mixed plastic and other nonrecycled materials that currently end up in landfills or are recovered through waste-to-energy technologies. Under this initiative, PADNOS supplied a plastic-rich fraction of ASR as a sustainable feedstock to Eastman's carbon renewal technology (CRT). Eastman successfully demonstrated addition and conversion of that ASR feedstock into a synthesis gas (syngas) which is subsequently used downstream in the production of its polyester and cellulosic thermoplastics. Resins from this production process were further formulated and then supplied to Yanfeng. The parts molded by Yanfeng for demonstration were successfully tested to meet a variety of OEM \u2013 Ford, GM, and Stellantis \u2013 requirements, thereby demonstrating proof of concept for a truly circular solution. The study proved feasibility of Eastman's carbon renewal technology (CRT), one of Eastman's two molecular recycling technologies, which breaks down the plastic-rich ASR into molecular building blocks. By recycling these complex plastics in CRT, Eastman can replace fossil-based feedstock and create polymers without compromising performance for use in new automotive applications. In addition to diverting waste from landfills, USAMP, a subsidiary of the United States Council for Automotive Research LLC (USCAR) also sees the potential for energy savings and reduced overall greenhouse gas emissions. Deloitte Consulting, LLP estimates more than 10 billion pounds of ASR is sent to landfills globally each year. \"We are encouraged by the initial results of this study,\" said Warwick Stirling, USCAR Executive Director. \"Innovative processes that enable ASR to be used in automotive parts can help bring us closer to more fully recycling end-of-life vehicles and enabling the possibility of a truly circular economy.\" \"This is a prime example of how collaboration across the value chain is essential to making material circularity mainstream,\" said Steve Crawford, Eastman executive vice president, manufacturing and chief sustainability officer. \"Modern cars are made with approximately 50% plastics by volume, on average; and this number is only expected to increase as automotive manufacturers continue to seek lighter electric vehicles. We're demonstrating a future where automotive hard-to-recycle plastics and fibers are diverted from landfills and recycled to produce new automotive parts.\" Kari Bliss, principal of sustainability at PADNOS said, \"The collaboration on this project is indicative of the work that is needed to create closed-loop and circular economy solutions. Our purpose statement is on full display with this project \u2014 to continue to find ways to innovate, lead and make a positive impact in this world. We are proud to be the mechanical recycler involved in this complex endeavor, which is the first of its kind in North America.\" \"Yanfeng is honored to be part of this project with USAMP, PADNOS and Eastman. Circularity and keeping plastic waste out of landfills is a priority for our company and the industry,\" said Jeff Stout, executive director global innovation for Yanfeng. \"We see a lot of potential with the resin developed with molecular reprocessing. We are pleased with the performance of the interior components we molded during the study and believe it would be a sustainable solution in production.\" About Eastman Eastman is a global specialty materials company that produces a broad range of products found in items people use every day.

Domestic sportswear label Li-Ning released a limited-edition recycled skater clothing capsule collection in collaboration with Steve Harrington. Beauty brands Shiseido and Biotherm exhibited their green proposals during the China International Consumer Products Expo in Hainan. And luxury houses like Prada announced their past year\u2019s results and upcoming ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) plans to further commit in the field. Domestic sportswear label Li-Ning released a limited-edition recycled skater clothing capsule collection in collaboration with Steve Harrington. Image: Li-Ning The scenario reflects the reality of brands trying to cater to local consumers becoming increasingly climate-conscious through green practices. In 2021, Accenture observed that the pandemic strongly influenced Chinese shoppers\u2019 sustainable consumption more than average globally. According to the consulting survey, 83 percent of Chinese consumers shared that the pandemic influenced them to make greener purchases versus 64 percent globally. With consumers pursuing sustainable practices and looking for brands that align with their values, Earth Day allows businesses to demonstrate their progress in space. \u201cEarth Day carries an incredible educational potential,\u201d says Sennait Ghebreab, academic and program leader at the Istituto Marangoni, and author of Responsible Fashion Business in Practice: Sustainable Concepts and Cases across the Fashion Industry. \u201cYear by year, it has been an effective way to promote eco-friendly programs, such as using renewable energy sources, resource conservation, and trash reduction,\u201d she continues. Here, Jing Daily looks at how brands approach the theme of sustainability in light of Earth Day. Local consumers\u2019 growing interest in clean and green beauty pushes skincare and cosmetics brands to act on reducing their packaging, supply chain CO2 emissions, and business models to meet shifting ethical needs. L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed a three-year deal with e-tailer Alibaba to establish low-carbon standards, develop new products, and create measurable circular economy solutions. Japanese beauty giant Shiseido is pushing for all its brands to integrate refill options into their selling methods. Image: Shiseido Other brands have come up with creative and innovative ways to address the issue for Earth Day. US-based skincare label Est\u00e9e Lauder encourages its clients to reuse their serum and cream bottles for house decoration, offering DIY suggestions. Japanese beauty giant Shiseido is pushing for all its brands to integrate refill options into their selling methods. Both initiatives aim to reduce beauty\u2019s notorious packaging and plastic waste issues. According to consumer research and retail monitoring service NIQ\u2019s 2023 report , 78 percent of respondents agreed that companies should show full supply chain transparency. \u201cThe development of conscious consumers has resulted in more thoughtful customers, who question their purchases and demand transparent and honest communication from all brands,\u201d states Ghebreab, the Istituto Marangoni fashion business course program leader. French beauty house Biotherm developed a product impact labeling system, which grades a product\u2019s pollution levels during the supply chain process. Image: Biotherm In light of this, French beauty house Biotherm developed a product impact labeling system, which grades a product\u2019s pollution levels during the supply chain process, allowing consumers to track the product\u2019s environmental and social impact. Biotherm introduced the new initiative at China International Consumer Products Expo in Hainan. Meanwhile, Prada Group is continuously investing in a vertical integration model to attain complete control and traceability of its supply chain \u2014 from sourcing, sampling, and production, to logistics. Eighty-eight percent of the group\u2019s manufacturing occurs in Italy, and a large part is conducted inside the group\u2019s owned facilities. Its logistic hub in Levanella, which covers 44,000 square meters, allows the brand to manage all its product shipments from the site.

Image: Prada Thanks to the easy accessibility of corporate information online today, consumers increasingly hold companies and groups accountable for their environmental and social impact. The corporate image directly influences the perception of its brand portfolio. Businesses are directly acting on a group level. Luxury conglomerates like Kering, LVMH, Prada, as well as Chinese sportswear group Xtep have all signed to reach net zero carbon footprint by 2050, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. Environmental is one aspect of sustainability. Social responsibility is also becoming a key area brand are investing in. \u201cPrada's motto is to be drivers of change. This vision is based on three pillars: planet, people, and culture,\u201d shares Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group head of corporate social responsibility. At the Italian luxury maison, women represent the majority of the workforce, 63 percent of the corporate population, and 59 percent of the women hold managerial positions. Through Prada Academy, the house trains young people to ensure the know-how is passed down to young generations. Image: Prada The fashion house is also investing in the future of the workforce. Through Prada Academy, the house trains young people to ensure the know-how is passed down to young generations. The company plans to employ 400 people by 2023, of which 200 will come from the Prada Academy. The latest figures show that 20 percent of Prada Group\u2019s workforce is under 30. Xtep\u2019s 2022 ESG report points out that the company invests in its employees\u2019 career growth and safety. In 2022, Xtep employee training hours reached 364,305 hours, training a total of 11,278 employees. Regarding employee health and safety management, Xtep implemented the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) at work. Meanwhile, Pwc\u2019s 2021 Global Consumer Insights survey on China revealed that 72 percent of Chinese consumers said they try to buy from environmentally responsible companies versus 54 percent globally. Not only do brands need to act on their traditional business model to make it sustainable and socially responsible, but they also need to communicate their commitment to shoppers timely. Sennait Ghebreab, the fashion academic adds: \u201cThe pivotal element to consider is always having a genuine and honest conversation and avoid greenwashing, as consumers penalize firms that release deceptive statements.\u201d That being said, Earth Day has become the perfect moment to deliver such a message.","filter_flag":1}

On April 6, L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed a three-year deal with the Chinese ecommerce giant to establish low-carbon standards, develop new products, and create measurable circular economy solutions, according to Alibaba\u2019s news site Alizila. Additionally, the two industry leaders will work together to clean up the beauty sector\u2019s supply chain \u2014 which covers warehousing, packaging, distribution and recycling \u2014 and to increase consumer education on sustainable lifestyles. The agreement comes after L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed a deal with Alibaba in 2018 to use environmentally friendly packaging for all its products sold in China. The Jing Take Both L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Alibaba have taken steps over the years to reduce their carbon footprint. In 2019, L\u2019Or\u00e9al achieved carbon-neutrality across its operation sites in China and has since launched a number of localized campaigns to raise awareness around sustainable consumption. Meanwhile, Alibaba has pledged to go carbon neutral by 2030 and facilitate 1.5 gigatons of decarbonization by 2035, supported by initiatives like its carbon ledger whereby consumers can earn points for making low-carbon choices. While these steps are commendable, it\u2019ll take a lot more to address beauty\u2019s glaring sustainability problem. The global beauty industry produces an estimated 120 billion units of packaging annually \u2014 most of which is not recyclable \u2014 and this packaging accounts for 70 percent of the industry\u2019s waste. This has a ripple effect on our oceans, forests, and even our bodies as microplastics end up in the food we consume. But tackling the issue is not just a matter of ethics; it\u2019s also a promising business opportunity. As awareness around climate change grows, so too does the demand for green products. According to a 2022 PWC survey, 50 percent of Chinese respondents said they are willing to pay a higher than average price for a product that has a traceable and transparent origin, while 45 percent are willing to do so for products made from recycled or eco-friendly materials. \u201cIn general, the willingness of Chinese consumers to pay more for ESG-friendly products is driven by the search for \u2018better-for-me\u2019 products \u2014 whether they are produced from a better source or made from materials that contain less \u2018harmful\u2019 materials to human,\u201d states the report. Ultimately, zero waste measures can only be accomplished when a product is eliminated entirely, which is an unrealistic expectation as companies vie for China\u2019s 88 billion beauty and personal care market. Perhaps making products more sustainably and strengthening public education around the concept, like what L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Alibaba hope to do, is the next best step.

She said the country has established a robust regulatory framework to anchor the sector, assuring them of government's support. She spoke on Thursday during the official opening of the 2023 Loop Forum in Copenhagen, Denmark, where she delivered the key note address at the invitation of the Danish Government. \"I therefore invite Danish, and by extension, Scandinavian investors interested in tapping into Kenya's waste economy to bring their circular economy solutions to Nairobi,\" she said. \"I assure you of my Ministry's and the government's full support as you bring your investments to Kenya.\" The Forum is Scandinavia's largest exhibition of circular economy technologies, products and innovations. It was attended by circular economy entrepreneurs, innovators and industrialists from Europe and the rest of the world. \"We look forward to joint learning and joint information exchange. We look forward to a robust partnership that will help us realise zero waste as we make circular economy a reality for Kenya,\" CS Tuiya added. In February 2023, Kenya hosted her inaugural Loop Forum with the support of the Danish and Dutch governments. The exhibition brought together over one thousand participants from across the world.","filter_flag":1}
