Enveloping over 70% of planet\u2019s surface, oceans regulate weather and climate patterns. More than 70% of earth oxygen generation is undertaken by algae in oceans. Humanity has depended on oceans for sustenance, progression, and survival. The rapid growth in human population and subsequent increment of human economic foot print is straining our continental resources. The menace of pollution is damaging our planet, putting the human well-being and even existence in danger. This has necessitated restructuring the way we interact with our planet in general and oceans in particular. As humanity\u2019s relationship with the ocean is getting increasingly demanding, therefore, new concepts are needed for revitalization of oceans in the way which is sustainable, progressive, and secure. Blue Economy provides the framework for synchronization of economic prosperity with the sustainability of nature. First coined by Gunter Pauli, the lynchpin of Blue Economy is sustainability. It deals with sustainable use of oceans for improved livelihood and economic growth without compromising the ocean health. Blue Economic model has direct compatibility with five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) crafted by United Nations. These five SDGs include eradication of poverty (SDG-01), ensuring of good health and well-being (SDG-03), emphasis on innovation and infrastructure development (SDG-09), undertaking climate action (SDG-13) and safeguarding of life below water (SDG-14). The potential of the Blue Economy is enormous. In 2010, the Global Oceanic Economy was valued at approximately 1.5 trillion USD, and by 2030, it is expected to surpass the 3 trillion USD mark. The net worth of Oceanic assets is estimated to be 24 trillion USD. Oceanic resources are vast but not unlimited. Therefore, sustenance of resources is essential. Blue Economy offers more reliable and credible alternative to traditional ocean based economic model. It deals with maritime economic professions like fisheries, resource extraction, marine transportation, and tourism, but within the bindings of ecofriendly regulations. Plus, it incorporates practices, like aquaculture\/mariculture, blue biotech, and renewable energy production from oceans, for improving productivity while retaining minimum impact on marine ecosystem. One of the fundamental pillars of the Blue Economy is the promotion of sustainable fisheries. In 2022, global sea food market was valued more than 257 Billion USD. It\u2019s projected to reach 350 Billion by 2027. Overfishing is rapidly depleting fish stocks and is disrupting marine ecosystems. To address the growing demand for seafood and alleviate pressure on wild fish stocks, the Blue Economy encourages the development of sustainable aquaculture and mariculture practices. These modern fish farming practises involve raising fish stocks and other marine lives like aquatic plants in controlled environment. By adopting these practises on global scale, we can reduce our reliance on wild fisheries while ensuring a consistent supply of seafood. In parallel, aquaculture and mariculture have the potential of generating more financial revenue than traditional fish catching practises. Currently Global aquaculture market is valued approximately USD 289.6 Billion and is expected to reach USD 421.2 Billion by end of 2030. The Blue Economy recognizes the vast potential of oceans as a renewable energy source. Offshore wind farming, tidal, and wave energy offer a sustainable alternative to carbon-based energy sources. In practise, offshore wind turbines are more efficient than onshore wind turbines. Horsea Wind Farm, located roughly 89 kms off the coast of Yorkshire, UK, is currently the largest wind farm in world. It can produce 1.3 GW of clean energy. By middle of this century, European Union is targeting to achieve 300GW energy generation from offshore wind farming. Similarly, it is estimated that 120-400 GW energy can be made available to mankind through tidal waves alone. The International Energy Agency\u2019s calculations suggest that ocean waves are capable of producing 8,000 \u2013 80,000 TW yearly. Clean ocean energy technologies may have high capital cost, but by harnessing enormous power of oceans we will not only foster a clean energy transition but also fulfil our immense energy requirements for generations. The Blue Economy encourages sustainable tourism practices that balance economic benefits with environmental conservation. The net contribution of global tourism and travel industry is approximately USD 5.8 trillion. Coastal and marine tourism constitute roughly half (50%) of net global tourism. These statistics proves that tourism is a major contributor to global economy, but its unregulated expansion can harm ecosystems. By promoting eco-friendly tourism, and marine conservation initiatives, we can create a positive feedback loop. Thriving ecosystems attract visitors, who, in turn, contribute to conservation efforts and generate revenue for local communities. The Blue Economy also promotes marine biotechnology \u2013 a new technological sector. Marine ecosystem is predominately unexplored and has rich biodiversity. Marine organisms contain natural compounds which can be used for developing new products like biomaterials, biofuels, biomedicines, and other innovations etc. Many such bio products are already in use in the fields of health care, livestock, industrial manufacturing, and transportation. Moreover, this technology is now being used to enhance the productivity of aquaculture and mariculture. For entire marine biotechnology sector, it\u2019s difficult to gauge its precise economic worth as it encompasses vast range of activities. Investing in research and development of marine biotechnology will not only drive economic growth but also contribute to the well-being of humanity and the conservation of marine ecosystems. Since humanity is intrinsically tied to the oceans, it is in the individual\u2019s best interest to act collectively to benefit from global commons. Such planning requires collaboration among local communities, industries, governments, and global organizations. Blue Economy has the potential to resolve our problems associated with economic growth and climate change. To protect and better utilize oceans in a sustainable manner, we must establish equilibrium \u2013 one rooted in true understanding of oceans and its relation with humanity. For that we have to periodically adopt sustainable fisheries, promote aquaculture, unlock renewable oceanic energy resources, harness marine biotechnology, practice responsible tourism, and implement effective governance.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}

Poor plastic waste management has caused issues such as blockages in drainage channels, and pollution of water sources, among others. It is against this background that authorities in Gulu City have come up with several projects aimed at curbing plastic pollution. One such project is the Gulu Go Green campaign where bins to collect plastics have been set up in different parts of the city. Mr Alfred Okwonga, the Gulu City mayor, says the campaign is aimed at making Gulu a model city in the country. \u201cWe want to see a clean and accessible Gulu City, with all the equipment we now have at our disposal, we have partnered with other corporate and civil society organisations to achieve this target,\u201d he says. The city has also set up plastic waste banks in every village and cell within the city to ensure plastic waste is collected in one location. This is part of the Gulu Integrated Catchment Management Partnership, which is funded by the World Bank and KfW Development Fund. Plastic waste banks The plastic waste banks, which are made of metallic meshes, were set up between 2021 and 2022. Mr Michael Rubanga, the Bardege Layibi City Health Inspector, says: \u201cA total of 240 plastic waste banks have been secured and deployed around the city.\u201d He adds that the city has more than 100 waste skips and five waste trucks, with the two divisions assigned two trucks each and one truck allocated to the city centre. Mr Rubanga says prior to the introduction of these facilities, plastics were either dumped in landfills or burnt due to the high transportation costs charged to move the materials to Kampala for recycling. The Gulu Integrated Catchment Management Partnership was launched in April. The project is supported by the Natural Resources Stewardship Programme (NatuReS) under the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union. It aims at collectively promoting Gulu City\u2018s economic growth through sustainable solid waste and water resources management. The intervention includes recycling waste into new products. Several local firms dealing in plastic recycling can now transform recycled plastic into new products, like chairs and tables. \u201cThis has not only added value to waste and further incentivised recycling but also created more jobs and income for communities,\u201d Mr Okwonga says. To address the challenge of insufficient data and improve collaboration along the waste value chain, the partnership supported the development of a waste collection app for Gulu City. Through the app, waste generators like households and companies can for example order bookings with private waste collectors to pick up their waste or get information about dates when specific types of waste are collected. According to NatuReS, the app also provides the city council with accurate real-time data on the amounts and locations of waste collected around town and thus spurs a more timely, innovative, and efficient solid waste management system. At the weekend, the city\u2019s leadership together with officials from Hariss International Ltd launched a new environmental campaign dubbed the Riham Green Ambassadors Clubs. The clubs have been set up in different schools in the city and are aimed at promoting environmental conservation among young people and increasing the national (plastic) recycling rate. \u201cAs a producer of plastics, our goal is to address the biggest hindrance to proper waste management which is behaviour and that is why mindset change has to be tackled right when children and youth are still in school,\u201d Ms Ishta Atukunda, Hariss International Ltd spokesperson, says. \u201cWe are setting up school clubs where club members will be trained on proper waste management and recycling, the selected schools have each been given seven recycle bins and mentors to teach them to separate waste into plastic, paper and organic or kitchen waste. \u201cBecause most packaging on the market is now 100 percent recyclable, we want to teach the young generation to recycle, reuse and recycle packaging waste. Recycling helps stop plastic waste by turning used plastic back into raw material for making new plastic products, etc,\u201d she adds. So far, 10 schools are set to benefit from the project. These include Layibi High School, Gulu High School, St Joseph\u2019s College Layibi, St John Paul II College, Ocer Champion Jesuit College, Gulu Central High School, Unifat Primary School, and Christ Church Primary School. \u201cUnder this intervention, we want to foster behavioural change in children at a young age so that they can embrace environmental conservation practices and become ambassadors of change in their communities for a sustainable future,\u201d Ms Atukunda says. Value addition Takataka Plastics is a local firm investing in plastics recycling by turning wastes, both organic and plastics, into high-quality affordable products. Since 2020, it has collected at least 46.5 tonnes of plastic waste and recycled it. Mr Patrick Masembe, a staff at the firm, said they are conserving the environment by recycling plastics. \u201cThis year, we intend to prevent 265 tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and train more youth in plastic recycling, circular economy, and social entrepreneurship,\u201d he said. Last year, Takataka, with support from the KfW Development Bank\u2019s Integrated Programme to Improve the Living Conditions in Gulu, also introduced the low-cost sustainable solution of bottle banks. The banks it deployed around the city are now offering an opportunity for communities to sort plastic from other waste categories. \u201cPeople simply deposit plastics they would have otherwise thrown away with other waste into the banks. The banks are mostly placed in public places like schools, hospitals, police stations and markets,\u201d Mr Masembe says. Once the banks are full, Masembe says there are groups of youth employed by the city council to empty the plastics into carts that are delivered to the Takataka Plastics processing unit in exchange for cash. \u201cThe youth are paid according to the kilogrammes they deliver,\u201d he says. Plastic pollution is a major challenge affecting cities in Uganda. photo\/ file CHALLENGES In the 2023\/2024 financial year budget, the city budgeted for only Shs10 million for plastic waste management. However, Ms Caroline Rose Adong, the secretary of finance and administration in the Gulu City Council, says more funds will be realised through partnerships. \u201cThe city has a waste management and financing capacity with funding and support from partners like KfW Development Bank and others which makes waste management easier,\u201d she says. Mr Michael Ocan, the Gulu environment officer, says the biggest challenge hindering proper waste management in the city is the mindset of the community towards waste management. \u201cOf all the waste skips put in all the corners of Gulu City, you find that people still throw plastics and other waste on the road,\u201d Mr Ocan says. Ms Agnes Oyella, the Gulu City senior planner, says: \u201cPeople need to change their mindset so that we have a clean and waste-free city. If we cannot change our mindset towards proper waste collections, we will continue to spend money on waste collections and have a dirty city.\u201d But Mr Okwonga says they have intensified sensitisation of residents who live or work within the city on proper waste management to keep the corridors and streets clean of garbage.","filter_flag":1}

With a history spanning over eight decades, HUL has firmly established itself as a leader in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, offering a diverse range of products that touch the lives of millions of Indians every day. From soaps and detergents to personal care items and packaged foods, HUL\u2019s portfolio encompasses an extensive array of well-known and trusted brands. Founded in 1933, HUL has continually evolved and adapted to changing consumer needs, market dynamics, and societal trends. The company\u2019s unwavering commitment to innovation, quality, and sustainability has been the cornerstone of its success. As a subsidiary of the global consumer goods giant, Unilever, HUL combines the strength of a multinational corporation with a deep understanding of the local Indian market, allowing it to cater to the unique preferences and demands of Indian consumers. HUL\u2019s journey began with a focus on manufacturing and selling Vanaspati, or vegetable oil, under the name Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company. However, the company soon diversified its product range to meet the evolving needs of Indian households. Over the years, HUL has introduced numerous iconic brands that have become household names, synonymous with quality and trust. Lux, Lifebuoy, Dove, Sunsilk, Surf Excel, Rin, Pepsodent, and Knorr are just a few examples of HUL\u2019s widely recognized brands. Beyond its commitment to providing high-quality products, HUL also places great emphasis on sustainable and responsible business practices. The company actively engages in initiatives aimed at environmental conservation, community development, and improving the livelihoods of marginalized communities. HUL\u2019s initiatives in water conservation, sanitation, and rural development have garnered widespread acclaim and reflect its dedication to being a responsible corporate citizen. As HUL continues to innovate, expand its product offerings, and explore new market opportunities, it remains deeply rooted in its mission of making sustainable living commonplace. With a focus on customer-centricity, HUL strives to deliver products that enhance the well-being and quality of life for consumers across the country. Through its continued growth and impactful initiatives, Hindustan Unilever remains at the forefront of the FMCG industry in India, embodying a legacy of excellence, innovation, and social responsibility. Foundation and Founders: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) traces its roots back to the summer of 1888 when crates filled with Sunlight soap bars arrived at the Kolkata harbor. These bars, proudly bearing the inscription \u2018Made in England by Lever Brothers,\u2019 marked the beginning of a new era in the marketing of branded Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). This marked the entry of Lever Brothers, the founders of HUL, into the Indian market. Following the success of Sunlight soap, Lever Brothers introduced other iconic brands like Lifebuoy in 1895, Pears, Lux, and Vim. The launch of Vanaspati in 1918 and the introduction of the renowned Dalda brand in 1937 further solidified the company\u2019s position in the Indian market. In 1931, Unilever, the global consumer goods powerhouse, established its first subsidiary in India called Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company. Lever Brothers India Limited was formed in 1933, followed by United Traders Limited in 1935. The three companies merged in November 1956 to create Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL). Notably, HUL became the first foreign subsidiary to offer 10% of its equity to the Indian public. Unilever currently holds 52.10% equity in HUL, while the remaining shares are distributed among approximately 360,675 individual shareholders and financial institutions. This strategic merger and the subsequent public offering cemented HUL\u2019s position as a critical player in the Indian FMCG sector, the stage for its remarkable growth and success in the years to come. 2. Early Years and Initial Products: During its early years, Hindustan Unilever, initially known as Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, focused on manufacturing and selling Vanaspati, a vegetable oil product. However, the company quickly expanded its product range to include a diverse array of consumer goods, such as soaps, detergents, personal care products, and packaged foods. The objective behind starting this business was to meet the growing demands of Indian households and improve the quality of life for consumers. Hindustan Unilever aimed to provide high-quality products that would enhance hygiene standards and cater to the evolving needs of Indian consumers. The founders, Lever Brothers and the Tata Group envisioned a business that would not only contribute to the economic development of the country but also have a positive social impact. By diversifying its product portfolio, Hindustan Unilever aimed to establish a strong foundation for future growth and become a trusted brand in the Indian market. The company sought to offer products that would bring convenience, cleanliness, and well-being to consumers\u2019 lives, thereby creating a lasting impact on Indian households. This objective has remained central to Hindustan Unilever\u2019s business philosophy throughout its journey of over nine decades. 3. Early Hindrances and Challenges: During its early years, Hindustan Unilever faced several hindrances and challenges that tested the company\u2019s resilience. One of the primary obstacles was the competitive market landscape. The consumer goods industry in India was already saturated with established players, making it difficult for a new entrant like Hindustan Unilever to carve out a space for itself. The company had to differentiate its products and build brand awareness among consumers to gain a competitive edge. Another significant challenge came in the form of establishing trust and credibility. Hindustan Unilever was an unfamiliar name in the Indian market, and consumers hesitated to switch from traditional products to those offered by the company. Overcoming this skepticism required consistent efforts in quality assurance, extensive marketing, and targeted promotional campaigns. Furthermore, the company had to navigate through the turbulent period of World War II, which significantly impacted business operations. Resources were scarce, and sourcing raw materials became a formidable challenge. The war disrupted supply chains and distribution networks, leading to production constraints and difficulties in reaching consumers. However, despite these obstacles, Hindustan Unilever managed to adapt and find innovative solutions to ensure continuity and meet the evolving needs of its customers. 4. Current Ownership and Name: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is currently majority-owned by Unilever, a global consumer goods company. Unilever acquired a controlling stake in HUL in the 1950s and has been instrumental in the company\u2019s growth and success. Under Unilever\u2019s ownership, HUL has expanded its product portfolio, strengthened its market presence, and continued to deliver value to its consumers. At the helm of HUL\u2019s leadership, Nitin Paranjpe serves as the Non-Executive Chairman, providing strategic guidance and oversight to the company. With his wealth of experience and industry knowledge, Paranjpe contributes to shaping HUL\u2019s long-term vision and objectives. Sanjiv Mehta has been the CEO and Managing Director of HUL, responsible for driving the company\u2019s growth, implementing key strategies, and leading its day-to-day operations. Mehta has played a crucial role in steering HUL towards sustained success, fostering innovation, and strengthening the company\u2019s position in the market. Furthermore, effective from June 27, 2023, Rohit Jawa will take over as the new CEO and Managing Director of HUL. Jawa\u2019s appointment brings fresh perspectives and expertise to lead the company into its next phase of growth. With a focus on leveraging digital technologies and embracing emerging trends, Jawa aims to further enhance HUL\u2019s competitiveness and market leadership. The seamless transition in leadership from Sanjiv Mehta to Rohit Jawa signifies HUL\u2019s commitment to continuity and sustained excellence in its operations. As HUL continues to thrive under their guidance, the company remains dedicated to delivering high-quality products and driving positive change in the consumer goods industry. 5.

When it comes to nutrition, Hindustan Unilever provides popular brands such as Horlicks, Hellmann\u2019s, Bru, Kissan, Lipton, Knorr, and more. These brands offer a variety of food and beverage options, including health drinks, sauces, soups, tea, coffee, and culinary products, catering to the nutritional needs and tastes of consumers. In addition to the above categories, Hindustan Unilever also has a presence in the ice cream sector with brands like Cornetto, Kwality Wall\u2019s, and Magnum. These brands offer a delightful assortment of ice cream products, including cones, sticks, and tubs, providing a refreshing indulgence for consumers. Through its diverse portfolio of products and brands, Hindustan Unilever ensures that consumers can access a wide range of choices in beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream. These brands exemplify Hindustan Unilever\u2019s commitment to delivering high-quality products that enhance consumers\u2019 lives and cater to their evolving needs. 6. Expansion into Global Markets: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) has emerged as a global force, expanding its operations beyond the borders of India to become a significant player in the worldwide consumer goods market. With a relentless focus on innovation, quality, and consumer satisfaction, HUL has penetrated over 190 countries, establishing a formidable presence worldwide.

HUL\u2019s global operations encompass many markets, including neighboring South Asian countries, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
