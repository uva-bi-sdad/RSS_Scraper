Download Free Sample Unlike forward logistics, where products move from the manufacturer to the consumer, the reverse logistics journey can be less predictable and more fragmented. Products may follow various routes depending on the reason for return (defects, recalls, customer dissatisfaction, etc.). This lack of visibility and control can lead to inefficiencies, longer processing times, increased transportation costs, and potential loss of value in returned products. Companies often struggle to gain a comprehensive view of their reverse logistics processes, hindering their ability to optimize operations, thus, impacting the reverse logistics market outlook. On the other hand, the rapid expansion of e-commerce has significantly increased the volume of product returns. According to IBEF, the e-commerce market in India could reach USD 350 billion by 2030, with an estimated number of online shoppers exceeding 200 million by 2025. Online shoppers expect hassle-free return processes, and companies need effective reverse logistics solutions to handle these returns efficiently. E-commerce retailers are exploring ways to minimize return rates, optimize return transportation, and manage returned products to recover their value. This growth in e-commerce has spurred demand for innovative reverse logistics strategies. COVID-19 Impact The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a substantial impact on the reverse logistics market. As supply chains were disrupted and consumer behaviors shifted, the volume of product returns surged due to factors like e-commerce growth and supply chain challenges. Companies faced difficulties in processing returns, assessing product conditions, and managing inventory. Health and safety concerns added complexity to handling returned goods. In response, businesses had to adapt their reverse logistics strategies, implement contactless return processes, and find innovative solutions to handle increased returns while prioritizing employee and customer well-being. Reverse Logistics Market Trends The concept of a circular economy is gaining momentum, and it's closely linked with reverse logistics. Companies are looking beyond simple returns management and exploring ways to extract maximum value from returned products and materials. This involves strategies such as refurbishing and reselling returned items, recycling materials to create new products, and designing products for easier disassembly and repair. Citing an instance, in January 2023, Nike announced that it would recycle 1 billion plastic bottles from its suppliers, employees, and consumers and use them to create new shoes and apparel. Embracing a circular economy approach not only aligns with sustainability goals but also presents opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation, carving an upward growth trajectory for the reverse logistics business.

Countries around the world continue to face the economic crisis left over by the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. With pressure to recover growth, governments are looking for more sustainable solutions, and will play a critical role in fostering long-term resiliency to withstand future crises. Many companies have taken a head-on approach to growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, but the surge in energy prices has intensified the need to cut costs. The dilemma companies in this situation often face is how to manage growth sustainably. If we want to map out a clear road to recovery and ensure a safe and balanced future, sustainability and circularity should be at the top of our minds and embedded into our solutions. However, according to the latest Circularity Gap Report, only 7.2 percent of the global economy is circular, dropping even lower than pre-pandemic levels of 8.6 percent in 2020. Despite this, countries are demonstrating an effort to create more circular economies. In 2021, ASEAN announced its own circular economy framework comprising actions that include harmonising circular products and services. Creating more efficient and sustainable products will help to reduce energy and resource consumption, drive higher repairability, and minimise waste \u2013 all working to reduce cost. With more than 80 percent of a product\u2019s environmental impact determined during the design phase, this process needs to start from a product\u2019s inception. BEING \u2018FRUGAL\u2019 CAN BE PROFITABLE There is an assumption that reusing, recycling and refurbishing products may not be a profitable way of doing business. However, contrary to popular belief, it is possible to run a profitable business whilst protecting the planet. When businesses rethink their models with circularity in mind, they can make products faster as they require fewer materials. This is a significant advantage when it comes to being \u2018frugal\u2019, especially when raw materials have soared in price by 18 percent compared to this time last year. It also mitigates the risk of material shortages due to supply chain issues, ensuring that businesses continue to hit targets despite disruption. The new business model of choice will be end-to-end circularity. The key to getting customers on board is demonstrating the right value proposition and showing the benefits of giving products a second life. By investing time and energy in planning, educating the market, and increasing awareness of skills and resources, we can spread the benefits of a circular mindset. DEMONSTRATING WHAT CIRCULARITY LOOKS LIKE Buying a re-manufactured product does not only have a positive impact on reducing carbon emissions but also on the consumption of raw materials and minerals. At Schneider Electric, we have created a new sustainable model where products can have a second life thanks to re-industrialisation. For instance, the Schneider Electric MasterTech site has been re-industrialising MasterPact circuit breakers since 2020. The circuit breakers are collected, disassembled, upgraded, and tested before being put back on the market. Being based in the factory where new products are made means that circular circuit breakers meet the same rigorous quality control standards as new products. It is estimated that by recycling and reusing products, we were able to reduce emissions by approximately 45 percent, resulting in savings of 755 kilogrammes (kg) of CO 2 per MasterPact. NEW WAYS OF WORKING INTRODUCE NEW CHALLENGES Taking one step further beyond repurposing parts is reverse circularity. It refers to the process of reintroducing waste materials back into the production cycle. The aim is to reduce waste and conserve resources, and involves taking end-of-life products or waste materials and turning them into new products or raw materials. By closing the loop in the production process, minimising waste and reducing environmental impact, reverse circularity is another way companies can reduce their reliance on virgin materials and conserve resources. However, circularity creates new pain points for businesses. For example, implementing a circular economy can be a difficult decision for vendors due to the challenge of reverse logistics, which can be up to 11 times more expensive than traditional logistics. This is due to the cost of returns, transportation, repairs, and reselling. To counter that, designing and producing products for services with a higher level of repairability would help to ease this new pain point, and hopefully reduce costs and dead inventory. TURNING BARRIERS INTO LADDERS FOR OPPORTUNITY Despite the challenges, circularly can bring new opportunities for partnership and innovation. Developing a new circular system hinges on nurturing new partnerships and evolving business models. Exploring the right partnership is crucial at the start and organisations should look to \u2018recycler\u2019 partners as a first step. These are exemplary model companies who are already active in the field and have mastered reverse logistics. Business partners also play a vital role in building out and driving circularity across the full value chain. By establishing an industrial ecology \u2013 or utilising all available or useful material and turning one person\u2019s trash into another person\u2019s treasure \u2013 we can create a win-win situation for our partners and the planet. Businesses can generate new revenue streams and save on operating expenses by creating upgradable offers that are circular and easily repairable. Furthermore, sustainable product packaging is a really big part of circularity. Making the transition away from single-use plastics to 100 percent recycled packaging is just one example of how small changes can forge a better, and more circular future. Approaching sustainability as a business can seem daunting, and it was only recently that more companies started incorporating sustainability into their strategies and targets. The advantage of the circular economy framework is that it can be applied to any type of business and sector, and it addresses pressing global issues like climate change, minimising waste, and pollution. If we want to bring a net zero world to life, we must look at how each element of our take-make-waste system can be improved. This spans from how we collect and distribute resources, the production and use of products, and how we process those materials afterwards. Our vision of a sustainable future can only be materialised if it is a circular one.","filter_flag":1}

Consequently, this escalating growth has engendered a mounting apprehension regarding the ability to satisfy the escalating demand for sustenance, all while ensuring the vital aspects of food security and sustainability remain intact. In light of these concerns, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the agri-food sector holds extraordinary potential to revolutionize the industry, heralding a new era of heightened sustainability. Artificial intelligence (AI) embodies the capacity of machines or computer programs to undertake endeavours typically reliant on human intellect, encompassing domains such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The realm of AI encompasses diverse subfields, each contributing unique capabilities to this expansive discipline. These subfields encompass machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and cognitive computing. Within AI technology, a plethora of algorithms emerges, including reinforcement learning, swarm intelligence, cognitive science, expert systems, fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Logic Programming, offering a rich tapestry of tools to leverage in pursuit of intelligent automation. Innovative Applications of AI in Food and Agriculture GRAIN QUALITY Manual grain inspection is a time-consuming process and is prone to human error, which can result in the selection of lower-quality grains. Therefore, the use of computer vision systems in grain inspection is becoming increasingly popular. These systems use advanced imaging techniques and ML algorithms to analyse images of grains and identify defects or impurities, such as broken kernels, foreign materials etc. Back propagation neural network (BPNN) has been effectively used to classify rice grain varieties with great accuracy (96%), even with poor image quality. PEST DETECTION AND WEED MANAGEMENT Accurate identification of insect species, size variation, and stage of development is crucial for effective pest management in agriculture. By identifying the type and number of insects present in a crop field, farmers can take appropriate measures to control the pest population and prevent damage to their crops. Several AI and ML technologies are being developed and tested for insect detection and counting. Some of these technologies use computer vision algorithms, while others rely on ML algorithms to identify and classify different insect species. Similarly, herbicides have been widely used by farmers for many years to control weeds and improve crop yields. However, the overuse or improper application of herbicides can have negative impacts on both human health and the environment. To minimize the negative impacts of herbicides, there is a growing need for more precise and accurate application methods. Robotic weed control is also an emerging technology that shows great promise for the future of agriculture. Robotic weed control systems typically use computer vision and ML algorithms to detect and identify weeds in crop fields, then use robotic arms or other mechanical tools to remove or destroy the weeds. Although intelligent mechanical weed control would be more felicitous than weeding devices with cutting action, contrary to time-based weed removal, it is possible to remotely regulate the tendency of tines of spring-tine harrow prototype systems based on the conditions of soil, the density of weed, and crop production. CROP SELECTION AND YIELD IMPROVEMENT Robots, such as the Berry 5 Robot from Harvest Croo Robotics (Tampa, FL, USA), are designed to automate the harvesting of strawberries, which is a labour-intensive and time-consuming process. The robot uses computer vision and ML algorithms to identify and pick ripe strawberries at a faster rate than humans can. This can help farmers to reduce labour costs and improve their yields by ensuring that more strawberries are harvested at the optimal time. FOOD SAFETY COMPLIANCE AI enabled cameras are used to ensure safety compliance amongst food workers in food facility. This employs facial-recognition and object-recognition software to determine whether workers are complying with good personal hygiene as required by food safety law. If violation is found, it extracts the screen images for review which can be rectified in the real time. The accuracy of this technology is more than 96%. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AI technology uses machine learning and predictive algorithms to model consumer flavour preferences and predict how well they will respond to new tastes. The data can be segmented into demographic groups to help companies develop new products that match the preferences of their target audience. With these, manufacturers could know what products will thrive before the hit the shelves. Companies like SPOONSHOT are using AI techniques like NLP (natural language processing) and computer vision to build organised information from unstructured data. They leverage food science domain knowledge to process data relating to physical and chemical properties of ingredients to understand how ingredient interactions impact a final recipe. SPOONSHOT can scout 3B social conversations, 5M research papers, 84M articles, 4M products, 84M blogs etc to provide actionable insights around product concepts, product and menu innovations, consumer market insights, competitor analysis etc. MARKET RESEARCH AND SALES ENABLEMENT AI offers tremendous potential to assist in market research within the food industry, providing valuable insights and facilitating better decision-making. AI algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data, including consumer preferences, purchasing behaviour, and social media interactions related to food. By recognizing patterns and correlations, AI can identify emerging trends, understand consumer preferences, and predict future demands accurately. This information can help food businesses tailor their products, marketing strategies, and overall consumer experience to meet evolving customer needs. Social listening tools like CRIMSON HEXAGON and SYNTHESIO helps generate valuable insights around audience analysis, brand intelligence, campaign analysis, customer sentiment, market research, trend analysis, competitor analysis etc, helping make smarter, data-driven decisions. (11) In the current attention-driven economy, where capturing and retaining attention is challenging due to the overwhelming choices and distractions faced by consumers, traditional market research methods have their limitations. However, AI-powered research offers a promising solution by providing rapid, reliable, and actionable insights. Companies like THE LIGHTBULB.AI leverage AI-enabled technology to offer a range of research services. These include qualitative and quantitative research, ad testing, as well as UI\/UX testing. Their advanced capabilities encompass facial coding, eye tracking, speech transcription, text sentiment analysis, and audio tonality analysis. These modules enable comprehensive analysis and understanding of user experiences and preferences. By harnessing AI in research, businesses can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and gain a deeper understanding of consumer behaviour. AI-based research offers the advantage of speed, accuracy, and scalability, allowing companies to adapt swiftly to evolving market dynamics and make informed decisions based on robust data-driven insights.
