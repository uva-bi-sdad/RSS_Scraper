Labour delegates will be asked to sign off the party\u2019s wide-ranging current policy programme at annual conference, after years of work thrashing out positions on many issues. The latest document was finalised and distributed internally within the party last month, setting out the most up-to-date and comprehensive statement yet of Labour\u2019s current policy stances. The 116-page document \u2013 seen by LabourList and summarised below \u2013 has taken years to compile as part of Labour\u2019s National Policy Forum (NPF) process and builds on the draft programme created by party officials earlier this year. The latest version has been updated following a crunch final NPF meeting of representatives from across the party in Nottingham in July. Once voted on at Labour\u2019s conference in Liverpool this October, the platform will inform how the party\u2019s next general election manifesto is written. NPF chair Anneliese Dodds has described the final document as a \u201cserious, credible and ambitious policy programme to enact the change that people are crying out for\u201d. A party source said Labour\u2019s \u201coverriding priority\u201d during the NPF process was to develop a programme that \u201cserves the British people\u201d, arguing that the final document \u201cshows that we have delivered upon that\u201d. They said the document contains no new commitments that increase spending or raise tax beyond what has already been set out by the shadow cabinet. It is far from clear how much of the document will make the campaign manifesto, however. Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting recently said there will be a \u201chigh bar\u201d for existing Labour policies to reach the manifesto, suggesting they must be credible, deliverable and make a \u201creal difference to people\u2019s lives\u201d. Click to jump to the report\u2019s six sections: a green and digital future, better jobs and better work, safe and secure communities, public services that work from the start, a future where families come first, and Britain in the world. 1.
