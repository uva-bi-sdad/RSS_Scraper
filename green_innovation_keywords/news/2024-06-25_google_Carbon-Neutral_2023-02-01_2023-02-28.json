Simultaneously, cities and countries are banning single-use plastics, the most recent being England. But as Loliware founder and CEO Sea Briganti tells AFN, such bans are impactful only if there\u2019s something to replace the plastics. Seaweed has several advantages over other materials currently used to make alt-plastics. Terrestrial-based crops like canola or corn require fertilizers and water, and reinforce mono-cropping, a notable offender when it comes to emissions and biodiversity loss. Loliware grows its seaweed with ocean farmers around the world. (The company never harvests wild seaweed.) Besides creating more \u201cblue economy\u201d jobs around the world, seaweed farming can capture carbon from the atmosphere and recycle it to emit oxygen, says Briganti. Seaweed can capture five to 20 times more carbon per unit area than land-based forests. It permanently stores some of that carbon in the seafloor. Among seaweed\u2019s other advantages are \u201cits fast growth cycle, the fact that it\u2019s capturing more carbon than terrestrial-based plants, and the fact that it\u2019s oxygenating the ocean,\u201d according to the company. Loliware\u2019s seaweed-derived resins are also fully compatible with existing manufacturing plastic extruding equipment. This drives down costs, which are often a barrier to adoption when it comes to bioplastic products. How Loliware works: Loliware uses a circular system to grow and harvest seaweed, turn it into pellets, produce products from the pellets, then put the used products back into the ground. For the Blue Carbon Straw, which is the company\u2019s first product, Loliware uses a five-step process. After harvesting and processing the seaweed, the team adds minerals and natural colors. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of green chemistry involved, all with ingredients from nature we\u2019ve carefully selected.\u201d This mix is then \u201cpellatized\u201d using an extrusion process. These \u2018Sea Tech\u2019 p ellets are similar to those used in plastic manufacturing. ellets are similar to those used in plastic manufacturing. Loliware\u2019s seaweed-based pellets are then shipped to the manufacturer, where they are processed into straws. Straws are compostable and can decompose as fast as a banana peel. The straws will still break down in a landfill but Briganti says composting is superior, as it \u201ccreates nutrient-dense soil, and we want to capture that carbon in the soil.\u201d Loliware currently works with Missouri-based plastics manufacturer Sinclair and Rush to make the straws. \u201cThey are a women-owned, 40-year-old factory,\u201d says Briganti. \u201cThey\u2019ve never invested in anything [bioplastic] in 40 years and they are so excited.\u201d Loliware says it currently produces 100 million straws per year. These are sent to the company\u2019s customers, which are mostly foodservice groups. Briganti says Loliware currently has 15 customers and will launch with 20 more this year. The latter will be a mix of large companies requiring hundreds of millions of straws as well as smaller businesses. Beyond the straw: Loliware\u2019s began developing its Blue Carbon Straw in 2019, around the time straw bans began. Many were quick to point out that children, the elderly, disabled persons, and others actually need straws. The same holds true today, and Briganti says part of Loliware\u2019s mission is \u201chaving an inclusive culture within the company\u201d that recognizes that need. She says the straw portion of Loliware is fully scaled. In a way, it\u2019s also \u201clike a demonstration product.\u201d \u201cWe really want to show the world that seaweed can compete with plastic at scale, that we can make a lot of [straws] at cost. We\u2019re already on par with bioplastics and paper straws. And on performance, we outperform a lot of those incumbents.\u201d Now the company is set to expand with new products made from its SeaTech pellets. Part of the pre-Series A funding will go to developing other single-use items such as cups, utensils, and films. In May, Loliware will launch a utensil set in London in response to the aforementioned ban on single-use plastics in England. Funding will also go towards more research and development. Legislative tailwinds are creating more opportunities for Loliware to bring its products to the masses. While part of the company\u2019s base are early adopters, others are facing bans on plastic and in need of a better solution than paper, says Briganti. \u201cBans are only effective and impactful if you can provide businesses with solutions,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, otherwise. We have to be collaborative here.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Only a united commitment to source-recycled materials in place of virgin raw materials during production processes will create a stable demand for greener products, and build the planet-saving circular economy we so desperately need. How Manufacturers are Uniting to Build a Circular Economy Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, we have been locked into a linear economy that manufactures, creates waste, discards, and manufactures again. Our goal is to build a circular economy that does not produce waste. Repurposing previously used materials in new products is a key step forward to a circular economy. To build a global circular economy, manufacturers are considering recycled materials as they explore and produce products, instead of simply repurposing their own production waste. When we, as manufacturers, include recycling in both our production and our waste management, we design new products to reflect new methods of recovering components and materials from worn-out products. We close the loop by producing sustainable products, bolstering green markets, and raising awareness among consumers about the benefit of sustainable choices in purchases as well as disposal. How Manufacturing Companies are Introducing Recycled Steel into Their Processes My area of expertise is recycled steel produced with electric arc furnace technology. It happens to be an ideal material for sustainable development and a perfect example of the circular economy we call recycling. This is because steel is infinitely recyclable. Instead of dumping old appliances or automobiles into a landfill, steel products that have reached the end of their lives can go right back into the supply chain to become steel, again and again. Because of its recyclable properties, steel is a material of choice for increasing numbers of end-users, who are turning to recycled steel to help them meet their environmental design goals. Steel made with recycled ferrous scrap as its primary raw material can be used interchangeably with steel made from virgin materials for virtually all applications, such as iron ore and coking coal, for virtually all applications. To help us harvest this scrap steel, our customers recycle a wide variety of products such as end-of-life automobiles, appliances, decommissioned steel bridges and buildings, machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging. We receive and process scrap steel at numerous metal recycling locations, melt it in electric arc furnaces, and form it into new steel products. This recycled steel is showing up everywhere, serving needs in industries such as agriculture, automotive manufacturing, civil construction, distribution, energy production, and mining. In addition, steel is a crucial element in emission-reduction infrastructure projects such as solar and wind power solutions. We have honed our manufacturing process to incorporate recycled steel at a rate of 98%. Our use of recycled steel also reduces carbon emissions in several ways. Steel production using electric arc furnace technology generates a fraction of the carbon emissions per ton compared to production from virgin materials. During the process, 97% of water is reused, and 99.9% of dust is captured and recycled. In addition, we limit our CO2 emissions by sourcing and shipping scrap metal within a 500-mile radius. Globally, the steel industry must reduce current greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. With this goal in mind, we are prioritizing greater energy and operational efficiency, increasing our use of scrap, expanding our use of sustainable forestry, employing renewable energy, and investing in new technologies and open innovation. Our mission is to be carbon neutral by 2050. Manufacturers are Moving Toward a Circular Economy As the sustainable development movement continues to grow, the trend toward manufacturers using recycled materials is gaining traction. Mounting pressure from community stakeholders, government officials, shareholders, customers, and employees to source materials responsibly is compelling manufacturers to examine their processes and make eco-friendly changes. In our linear economy, industrial processes are designed around virgin materials. Because of this, using recycled materials often leads to snags in a manufacturer's value chain. However, when we take time to adjust our production processes, we find the value in using recovered materials. Finding this value boosts the widespread drive to recover materials and reduces costs. This is why we must promote up-cycling during the early design process. As manufacturers, adopting recycled materials forces us to face new challenges in maintaining our supply of materials, modifying production processes, maintaining production efficiency, and gauging consumer demand for green products. These barriers are daunting, but they all have solutions. To build a circular economy, we must transform the supply chain, redesign products, and create consumer demand for sustainable products. Though a fully circular economy may be decades in the future, each time a manufacturer introduces waste-derived, recovered, or recycled materials into their products, we take a crucial step forward.

An estimated 92 million tons of clothing waste is created each year, and with a reuse rate of just 1 percent, most of this textile waste will go to landfills. Synthetics\u2014including polyester and spandex\u2014accounted for 62 percent of the textile fiber market in 2020, according to Textile Exchange. Most synthetic materials cannot biodegrade in soil, taking hundreds of years to decompose and leaching chemicals into soil and groundwater. Polymer-based microfibers also shed from garments during manufacturing, wear and laundering, ending up in bodies of water and people\u2019s bodies through inhalation, posing a health risk. Making the switch from synthetics to natural fibers is one way to fix fashion\u2019s waste challenge. Man-made cellulosic fibers (MMCFs), or wood-based materials like viscose and lyocell, are particularly promising alternatives to synthetics due to their natural, renewable and biodegradable attributes. They are also very versatile. They can create textiles that range from silky to non-woven, allowing for applications including homeware, fashion and hygiene items. Despite these benefits, adoption remains low. MMCF production volume more than doubled between 1990 and 2021 to 7.2 million tons, and yet it still holds a mere 6 percent market share. Plant-based MMCFs can return to nature at end of life, as demonstrated by leading MMCF manufacturer Sateri, whose viscose has been certified by TUV Austria to be biodegradable in soil, water and marine environments, as well as home compostable. Fibers placed in these environs will break down into non-toxic organic material within 28 days. One main critique of MMCFs is the potential impact to forests. Knowing the origins of the fibers is therefore critical and must be proven. This is where Sustainable Forest Management Certifications, such as the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) can play a key role in ensuring that apparel made out of wood-based cellulosic fibers such as viscose and lyocell are sustainably sourced and responsibly produced. Textile Exchange estimates the portion of certified wood-based fibers grew from 55 to 60 percent in 2020 to 60 to 65 percent in 2021, but that leaves upwards of 35 percent that is uncertified. Many brands and viscose companies, Sateri included, have committed to source only from renewable and sustainably managed plantations. In addition to sourcing certified materials proved via the PEFC chain of custody certification mechanism, Sateri requires all its dissolving wood pulp (DWP) suppliers to sign a Declaration of Commitment to its Pulp Sourcing Policy and provide greenhouse gas emissions information. Courtesy The other key concern around MMCF production is its chemical-intensive production process, which may potentially pose damage to the environment and health risks to people. And the industry has stepped up its efforts to address these issues head-on. Sateri and some leading viscose manufacturers, accounting for more than 50 percent of viscose production, have committed to best-in-class benchmarks such as the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) MMCF Responsible Fibre Production Guidelines and the European Union Best Available Techniques Reference Document (EU-BAT BREF) on polymers. Sateri recognizes the need for the fashion industry to decouple growth from further resource impact. As a major raw material supplier, Sateri aims to support the industry\u2019s ambition through its Vison 2030 long-term plan, which covers four dimensions of sustainability: Climate and Ecosystem Protection, Closed Loop Production, Innovation and Circularity, and Inclusive Growth. \u201cOur vision articulates how we aspire to grow in a way that we put back more into the environment and society than we take,\u201d said Miranda Chen, strategic marketing director at Sateri. \u201cThis would also be Sateri\u2019s defining market differentiator underpinning our continued growth in volume and value.\u201d Besides sustainability, Sateri focuses on the R&D of new products, which has promoted many kinds of cellulose fiber products, including viscose fiber EcoCosy\u00ae, Sateri Lyocell, and recycled fiber FINEX\u2122. In 2022, Sateri\u2019s R&D expenditures exceeded $88 million. Closing the loop Circularity can simultaneously tackle textile waste and reduce the volume of wood needed for fiber production. China, wherein Sateri\u2019s operations are based, produces about half of the globe\u2019s textile fiber volumes, and accounts for 60 percent of MMCF production. The country is also a significant consumer of these materials, at the mill and manufacturer level and at retail. China is taking an aggressive approach to circularity. In 2021, the government released a five-year plan that prioritizes material reuse, and in 2022, the National Development and Reform Commission set a 2025 goal to recycle a quarter of textile waste, producing 2 million metric tons of recycled fiber each year. Innovating around circularity, Sateri launched recycled fibers in 2020 under the FINEX\u2122 brand, with up to 20 percent recycled content. Short for \u201cFiber Next\u201d, FINEX\u2122 is made from pre- and post-consumer materials mixed with wood pulp, resulting in circular fibers that are identical to virgin wood-based materials. Most recently, Sateri has successfully produced FINEX\u2122 viscose fibers with up to 50 percent recycled content. MMCFs with values Along with responsible sourcing and circular practices, reducing the environmental impact of MMCFs revolves around the production process. At Sateri\u2019s viscose and lyocell mills, the focus is on maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste. The company recovered 98 percent of sulphur in 2021. \u201cOur viscose mills have been independently verified to be EU-BAT compliant, fulfilling the target set out in our 2030 plan two years ahead of schedule,\u201d explained Chen. The company was the first viscose producer to achieve the Oeko-Tex Made in Green label, the standard\u2019s most stringent certification that includes testing for hazardous substances and assessments of the factory\u2019s environmental and social responsibility. As well as sustainability, Sateri places equal priority on quality. In addition to sustainability credentials, Sateri\u2019s EcoCosy\u00ae fibers are breathable and skin-friendly with longer staple fiber lengths than other natural materials. Sateri\u2019s functional viscose has softer hand feel, as well as anti-bacterial properties. EcoCosy has been used for everything from intimates and athleisure to fashion garments and childrenswear. \u201cAdvanced fiber manufacturing technology helps improve the softness of fibers,\u201d said Chen. \u201cIt can be mixed with various fibers and yarn blends to meet consumers\u2019 desires for comfort and softness.\u201d Viscose can help brands meet current customer demands. \u201cIn the post-epidemic era, consumers\u2019 purchasing habits have changed,\u201d explained Chen. \u201cPeople began to pay more attention to physical and mental health than work achievement. Consumers changed from hectic lifestyles to healthy and comfort living, which also impacted apparel purchases.\u201d Sateri aims to become a net-zero producer by 2050 in step with the objectives of the United Nations Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. As part of this commitment, Sateri has introduced carbon-neutral versions of its EcoCosy\u00ae viscose fibers, Sateri Lyocell and FINEX\u2122 recycled fibers that are combined with credits to compensate for carbon emissions that cannot be avoided or reduced. \u201cIn addition to meeting our own goals, we also hope to support our customers meet their sustainability ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of their products,\u201d said Chen. MMCF production is projected to possibly reach 10 million tons in the next 15 years, about double where it stands today. Whether around sustainability, circularity or adoption rates, wood-based fiber makers like Sateri are planting roots that will usher in more growth.

This time, it is a conversion of a 20-ton loader for a speedier market entry. Volvo CE has been making headlines since it announced targets towards carbon neutrality by 2040 and an electric vehicle share of 35 per cent of its sold machines in 2030. In today\u2019s news, the company said again that when it comes to delivering a carbon-neutral construction industry, \u201cwe must act now\u201d. This is also why, this time, Volvo CE opted for an EV conversion which may even be offered as a retrofit solution depending on the market demand, so the company. Together with CE Engineering Solutions and Parker Hannifin, formerly Parker Appliance Company or just Parker is an American corporation specialising in motion and control technologies. The cooperation resulted in the L120H Electric Conversion, which Volvo CE will make available this year for selected customers in Europe. 240 kWh batteries provide a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications, and Volvo CE says it can charge from 0-100% in 1.5-2 hours. Standard features include Comfort Drive Control, Load Assist with On-Board Weighing, plus radar detection with a new Collision Mitigation System. In addition, the L120H Electric Conversion will be supported by dedicated electromobility applications, which allow the operator to check the battery and charging status and preheat the cab. This latest collaboration expands Volvo CE\u2019s line of electric wheel loaders. Also, it follows the company\u2019s investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach, announced in June, to broaden the electric excavator portfolio. With the L20 Electric and L25 Electric, Volvo CE already has two light electric wheel loaders in its range. However, the Arvika plant specialises in medium and heavy wheel loaders \u2013 so new products can also be expected. While the partnership approach allows for a speedier implementation to the market, according to Volvo CE, it happens in parallel with dedicated electric solutions like the EC230 Electric, a 23-ton battery electric excavator built on Volvo CE\u2019s own advanced technology. Only last week, Volvo CE announced expanding its largest excavator factory in South Korea to prepare for electrifying the largest segments. \u201cBoth approaches (retrofit and EV dedicated) are needed if the industry is expected to reach carbon reduction targets,\u201d says the company. \u201cThere is no time to wait \u2013 we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonisation goals,\u201d Carl Slotte, Head of Sales Region Europe at Volvo CE, added. \u201cOur commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.\u201d To register interest in the L120H Electric Conversion, customers may contact their local Volvo CE dealer or email the company directly. volvoce.com","filter_flag":1}

Mighty electric has an estimated laden range of approximately 240km and is the ideal zero-emission workhorse for metropolitan and last-mile deliveries. Mighty electric\u2019s 120kW, 320Nm traction motor is powered by a 114.5kWh battery system with rapid charging capability - 10% to 100% in under 70 minutes. This technology gives Mighty electric capabilities that perfectly complement those of the long-haul, heavy load XCIENT Fuel Cell prime mover, which HMCA is studying for a potential trial in Australia. Mighty electric will help drive an expansion in emissions-free commercial transport options by demonstrating its driveability and everyday practicality, while helping to reduce the carbon footprint of transport and logistics operations in Australia. Heavy vehicles make up only four percent of the national vehicle fleet, yet ICE heavy vehicles are responsible for 25 percent of all vehicle emissions in Australia. This means each Mighty electric will have a disproportionately large impact on total emissions reduction. The arrival of this efficient and effective electric truck will mark another important step towards Hyundai Motor Company\u2019s global ambition to be carbon neutral in products and operations by 2045. \u201cWe are excited to announce Mighty electric truck for Australia as a key step in driving growth in emissions-free commercial vehicles,\u201d Hyundai Motor Company Australia Chief Executive Officer, Ted Lee said. \u201cMighty electric will bolster our growing EV line-up and underlines Hyundai\u2019s continuing commitment to developing sustainable mobility solutions,\u201dhe said.

Just as the Roomba revolutionized vacuuming, Worx\u2019s robotic lawnmowers are hoping to transform lawncare. The company\u2019s latest innovation, the Landroid Vision (shown at right), makes things easier than ever. \u201cWe joke around internally that if you have to interact with a robot, is it truly a robot?\u201d Todd Zimmerman, VP of product at Worx, tells CGT. \u201cWe want to bring more convenience and ease of use to the field.\u201d Robotic mowers tend to cost about the same as a rider mower \u2014 somewhere in the $1,000 to $1,500 range \u2014 but in the U.S., they represent less than 5% of the U.S. lawnmower market. Part of the reason for that is existing models require owners to install boundary wire as a perimeter marker. The Landroid Vision, though, uses an onboard sensor and camera array that communicates with the mower\u2019s neural network to avoid obstacles (like rocks, hoses, and plant beds) and identify yard boundaries. The company has spent the last two years developing the technology to translate camera images to its proprietary onboard processing system. Teaching a robot what is and isn\u2019t grass (and what\u2019s safe to mow over) isn\u2019t as easy as it might seem. There are also security and safety issues to refine. For instance, if someone is foolish enough to pick up the mower while it\u2019s operating, it instantly shuts down; should someone steal the system, it locks down, requiring a PIN code. Worx may not be as familiar as other names in the lawn care space, but Zimmerman says that\u2019s not a concern for the company right now. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s okay to be No. 2, because you can gain an understanding of what people are frustrated with in the category and overcome those issues. \u2026 We want to bring more convenience and ease of use [to the lawn care industry].\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Race to net zero carbon: A climate emergency guide for new and existing buildings in Australia is a national reference guide that details critical information about best practice materials and construction for whole-of-life net zero carbon buildings. \u201cHistorically, most professionals have only focused on reducing the operational carbon footprints of buildings,\u201d said professor Deo Prasad, lead researcher of the guide. \u201cOperational carbon refers to what is required for the building to run once it is built, like energy use in heating or cooling. \u201cThere are significant amounts of emissions embedded in the materials and construction of the building itself and these need to be addressed and offset in order for our built environment to be truly net zero.\u201d The guide is the first of its kind to detail a holistic approach to achieving zero carbon buildings. \u201cOur guide goes deeper than just operational offsetting. It illustrates a \u2018whole of life\u2019 approach to buildings \u2013 considering where building material comes from, how they are transported to the construction site, and so on,\u201d Prasad said. The guide advocates for retrofitting existing buildings and reducing the use of new material as the best way to minimise embodied carbon. However, when that is not possible, the guide provides a roadmap for low-carbon materials such as green steel and concrete. It also details how materials could be reused after a building has been demolished in a circular economy. \u201cTimber, aluminium and glass can be reused or recycled somehow into new products,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cIt\u2019s [also] possible to avoid demolishing old or undesirable buildings as their concrete structures can stay put and the building can be refurbished.\u201d Prasad said he hopes the guide will help the building industry move towards net zero construction as a norm, rather than the exception. Globally, the built environment accounts for 37 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in Australian the built environment is responsible for 21 percent of the country\u2019s emissions. \u201cWhile the global community is aiming for net zero by 2050, the building sector has much greater potential and opportunity to reach net-zero operational emissions by 2030 and a 60 percent reduction in embodied carbon by 2030,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cThese are the goals our guide aims to achieve.\u201d He added that, \u201cGovernments should mandate net-zero construction codes, which will push for best performance to achieve net zero. They should lead by example and ensure all public buildings are net zero carbon and provide subsidies and rebates to incentivise change. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about eliminating worst practices. It\u2019s about adopting best practices, which, policy-wise, is also economically the right thing to do. \u201cOur guide has all the knowledge the industry needs to achieve net zero \u2013 a roadmap that shows it can be done and, most importantly, the type of conversation clients can have with designers or government. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that the industry \u2013 be it clients, government or designers \u2013 start speeding up the race to net zero carbon before it becomes too late in the climate emergency.\u201d The guide is available for free on the UNSW Sydney website.","filter_flag":1}

It is even more so for the manufacturers of smartphones. As the demand for phones grows, so does the demand for environmentally responsible products and the need to address the growing concern of e-waste internationally. At Mazuma, sustainability and providing new life for old phones is at the heart of our business. However, how much effort is being taken by the industry giants responsible for making the phones? We look at what actions are being taken, particularly with the two biggest giants in tech, to reduce the impact of smartphones on the environment. Recycling and reusing materials There are many ways the big manufacturers are improving production; the most important is using recycled materials. For instance, Samsung, the leading android phone manufacturer, uses ocean-bound plastics such as discarded fishing nets to produce plastic components within their Galaxy range of phones. They also use it for the casings and details of their wearable tech, such as earbuds and smartwatches. Apple, another big player in the world of phones, also reuses recycled materials to create its range of iPhones. For example, in 2021, 59% of all the aluminium Apple used within its products came from recycled sources. In addition, all new iPhones, iPads, AirPods and Macs feature 100% recycled tin in their main logic motherboard solder. However, one of the biggest issues faced by every phone manufacturer was the use of plastic. The most significant way the tech industry solves this problem is by using PCM plastic (Post Consumer Material). This plastic has already lived its life in the form of something else, such as plastic bottles and carrier bags. By recycling these everyday items, the plastic is made into pellets that can be remoulded into new products. The use of PCM is part of many industries\u2019 efforts to aim for a circular economy in which products are put back into the circle of production with the help of phone recycling facilities like ours. Reducing the carbon footprint of your phone A carbon footprint measures the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere due to human activities, including burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other land use changes. It is often expressed in terms of equivalent tons of CO2 and is used to understand and quantify the environmental impact of individual activities, organisations, and entire countries. Samsung is promising to reduce carbon emissions with its range of smart technology, allowing users to lower their own carbon footprints with their product. They also offer their action plan, which addresses the risks within their carbon footprint and their goals to lower these each year to improve their sustainability. Apple also products that reduce the user\u2019s carbon footprint, with the likes of their Apple TV box, which reduces carbon footprint by up to 34%. Apple has also been carbon neutral since 2020 and aims to have all their products carbon neutral by 2030. Companies can improve their carbon footprint in various ways, including carbon offsetting, strict supply chain management and renewable energy sources supplying factories and offices. Most large phone manufacturers are being transparent in their aims to become more sustainable each year, with reports and plans visible on their websites. So if you are ever curious about the business behind your tech, check them out before buying their products for a more eco-conscious purchase. Developing longer-lasting products We all remember the scandal from 2018, when the Italian competition authority investigated the big two phone brands and their curious updates, making some smartphones within their older collections obsolete. Both companies were fined, and although they claimed they were unaware of the issues caused to older phones by the updates, it sparked a debate on the ethical practices of making smart devices poorly designed for future updates. The issue with smartphones is that they have come a long way from when they first came out, and naturally, phones will get left behind. For example, the iPhone 14 is a long way more advanced than the iPhone 6S, so developing updates that suit both iPhones and everything in between is not entirely practical. However, instead of making the phones obsolete, the newer updates will simply leave the phone vulnerable due to a lack of support. Any updates will no longer harm your devices, but you will be at risk for cyber-attacks. So, if you have an older device, why not consider getting a good price for it now with our sell my iPhone services? Environmentally friendly packaging One of the biggest issues when buying a new phone was all the unnecessary packaging it came with. Like most tech, there was an array of plastic wrap, polystyrene and plastic shells to keep everything in place. This is not only a waste of resources but also a nightmare when it comes to bin day after Christmas. To combat this waste, many phone companies are addressing their packaging and what is really required for a new phone. The plugs are one of the most noticeable recent removals from the box of new phones. Although these are essential for providing power for your phone to charge, most homes already have an abundance of them from previous phones and devices. Many homeowners are also changing their plug sockets to USB-compatible sockets removing the need for plugs altogether. This allowed many big brands of phones to take the plug out of the box, which helped to reduce unnecessary e-waste and even made the box much smaller, needing fewer materials. If you have bought a phone recently, you may have noticed very little printed on the box. In fact, if you were to buy a Samsung TV, you would see it is almost entirely brown with minimal information. Lack of printing helps reduce the ink needed to print onto the box, which also became an issue when the box needed to be recycled. This new basic design is much more environmentally friendly and can be done using pre-recycled materials. Next time you get a new phone, consider what is missing since the last time you bought one. Companies are working throughout the entire supply chain to reduce unnecessary packaging for products. Even the instruction booklet which comes with your shiny new phone is minimal, with everything else accessible online through the help of QR codes and links. The change is minimal but has greatly impacted the waste produced and the overall carbon footprint of a device. Trade-in services and phone recycling Obviously, achieving a circular economy, the aim of most tech industries, can only be made possible by selling your old phone back to the manufacturer. Most big names in phones will offer some form of a phone trade-in when you upgrade to help minimise the products heading to landfill and allow them to recycle the parts within their new phones. However, whilst we may not be able to manufacture the latest iPhone or Galaxy S24 (although you can buy many of the latest phones through our refurbished phones site), we do know a thing or two about recycling. Much like the industry\u2019s tech giants, we at Mazuma are also looking to achieve a more sustainable planet. Our mission is to provide new old phones with new life due to programs such as our incredible Samsung trade-in services. Unlike the big names, recycling phones is our only mission, which means we are pretty much the experts. We offer some of the best prices online for many iPhones and android phones instead of a set figure. So, for example, when you sell an iPhone with us, we don\u2019t provide you discounts or money off a new product; we offer you cash directly to your bank, often the same day we get your phone. By selling your broken phones with Mazuma, you are still contributing to the circular economy, but you are getting more money for your device and no pressure from us to buy a new one. Our services are straightforward, easy, and honest. So when it comes to trading in your phone to help promote a sustainable future, make sure you are doing so with someone who is an expert in recycling phones.","filter_flag":1}

The explosive ubiquity of electronic gadgets is becoming a growing a menace, as their disposal continues to pose a major threat to human health and the environment. Based on current figures, over 52 million tonnes of electronic waste are generated annually across the globe. In 2022, researchers estimated that out of the roughly 16 billion phones owned by people around the world, an estimated 5.3 billion would become waste. The burden of Electronic waste A bulk of electronic waste containing hazardous materials such as mercury is dumped illegally and ends up in landfills or incinerated. These materials then leak into the soil, pollute water bodies and enter the food chain. Such was the case at an electronic waste disposal site in Central Accra, Ghana, where hens\u2019 eggs were found to have chlorinated dioxins (a toxic material) at levels that were 220 higher than those permitted in Europe. Countries in the Global South have been bearing the brunt of the crisis, as wealthy nations continue to dump thousands of tonnes of electronic waste in the form of old computers, phones and tablets presented as donations. Researchers have begun to sound the alarm on this trend, warning that carbon emissions from the production, use and disposal of electronic devices will account for 14 percent of all emissions by 2040, an equivalent of one half of the emissions from the world transport sector today. The situation is predicted to reach critical levels in 2050, with up to 120 million tonnes of discarded electronics, if nothing is done. There have been multiple attempts at recycling such waste through various modern interventions, among them Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. But the latter involve the use of high temperatures and hazardous chemicals, which consume a great deal of energy and are harmful to both human health and the environment. Yet the recycling industry - estimated at USD 62.5 billion - continues to explore opportunities as the demand for precious metals soars to satiate the growing global appetite for electronic devices and as the availability of natural resources and rare earth elements dwindles. Is Clean recycling possible? As demand for eco-friendly, carbon-neutral technologies intensifies, researchers, scientists and private companies are exploring sustainable recycling options, among which is the use of beneficial bacteria and fungi in a process dubbed Bioleaching. Using non-toxic chemicals and less energy, the process has been hailed as the future of electronic waste recycling. \"At a time when the world is experiencing unprecedented availability of electronic gadgets - and dumping in equal measure, the biggest challenge has been [figuring out] how to safely discard them,\" Caleb Mtamisi, an environmentalist teaching at Kenyatta Universit and a vocal advocate for the recycling of e-waste, told FairPlanet. \"It is a big problem, especially in developing countries that do not have the requisite infrastructure to recycle,\" he added. \"This has far reaching environmental and health impacts. Numerous studies have pointed to the dangers that these countries are staring at with the e-waste menace.\" One of the companies that stepped up its efforts to provide biological e-waste recycling solutions is Mint Innovation, a New Zealand clean tech startup. Through a low-tech process of using naturally sourced microbes, the company is able to recover precious metals from crushed e-waste. Its bio-refinery in Sydney, Australia has potential to recycle more than 3,000 tonnes of e-waste, which can be repurposed to manufacture new products. The goal of the startup is to establish similar bio-refineries in all major cities around the world. Over in the UK, N2S, a company that offers IT lifecycle services, has been working with Coventry University to extract and recycle precious metals from electronic waste by using non-toxic bacteria. Coventry University has also extracted copper from computer circuit boards that were discarded and recycled them into high-quality foil using bioleaching, a process that could inspire industrial application. At the same time, IMC University of Applied Sciences Krems in Austria has been betting on bacteria and algae to recycle rare earth metals from electronic waste in a project dubbed REEgain. The initiative works with local waste management and recycling companies that supply electronic waste in a bid to promote inclusivity. Catalysing a circular economy Some experts state that in addition to reducing the harmful effects to human health and environment, the use of bacteria to recycle electronic waste is spurring a circular economy which they predict could have a market value of up to $4.5 trillion by 2030. \"Bioleaching has provided a unique model that not only guarantees safety of human health and environment, but harnessed a circular economy where what is produced doesn\u2019t go to waste,\" noted Mtamisi, adding that, \"the process of that recycling fanned a market that is creating jobs.\" \"However,\" he cautioned, \"to make all this inclusive there is a need to bring into the equation manufacturers and producers of these electronics.\" Image by John Cameron.","filter_flag":1}

H2GO Power, a hydrogen energy startup created at Imperial from research carried out at Cambridge University, has signed a partnership with major boiler manufacturer Baxi to develop systems that will decarbonise a wide range of industrial heating processes. Its first application will be using hydrogen to pre-heat natural gas before it enters the distribution system, without creating greenhouse gases. Dr Enass Abo-Hamed \u201cThis partnership is a key milestone for the company,\u201d says Dr Enass Abo-Hamed, the company\u2019s co-founder and Chief Executive. \u201cBaxi is a market leader in the heating manufacturing industry, and it has chosen H2GO Power out of all the other solutions on the market as a partner to build new products with.\u201d Hydrogen is a vital part of efforts to decarbonise the economy, both as a zero-carbon fuel in its own right, and as a means of storing energy from renewable sources. However, no-one has yet found an economic way of using pure hydrogen for industrial heating. This is the challenge that H2GO and Baxi have taken on. H2GO\u2019s core technology is an innovative way of storing hydrogen. Instead of compressing the gas for storage in cylinders, its system allows hydrogen to be absorbed, stored and released in a safe, highly controlled way. This highly adaptable approach has been developed for a range of applications, from storing surplus renewable energy to industrial heating. This could stretch from the cement, glass, and ceramics industries, to chemicals, food and drink, and paper and pulp. \"Hydrogen is a viable alternative net zero energy carrier that can meet the needs of these hard to decarbonise sectors, and can be used for mass storage of variable renewables \u2013 such as wind and photovoltaics \u2013 to use at times of peak demand for heat,\u201d says Karen Boswell, Managing Director at Baxi UK & Ireland. \u201cDeveloping practical, cost-effective ways of storing hydrogen addresses both decarbonisation and energy reliability, making this project a particularly interesting solution for multiple use cases.\" Developed at Imperial H2GO\u2019s technology is based on research carried out at the University of Cambridge, which was then developed further and commercialised at Imperial. In 2017, the H2GO team took part in the Cleantech Accelerator run by Imperial for the Climate Knowledge Innovation Community (Climate KIC), which has since evolved into the Undaunted climate change innovation partnership. Professor Nigel Brandon Dr Abo-Hamed then continued to develop the company through a Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Hub Fellowship, in the laboratory of Professor Nigel Brandon in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering. \u201cImperial really welcomed us when we moved from Cambridge and I started the RAE fellowship,\u201d she says. \u201cThey gave us mentorship and access to courses, and we worked alongside engineers from Nigel's lab, and ended up applying for grants with them. So, we developed and learned from everything that was around us at Imperial.\u201d Professor Brandon also joined H2GO Power\u2019s advisory board, sharing his expertise as a scientist and a founder of the startups Ceres Power and RFC Power. \u201cHe's always been a mentor, and has advised me on a lot of matters in addition to technology development, such as how to think about the future of the product, and how to anticipate obstacles and design our way around them. The greatest leadership lessons I have acquired, I actually learnt from him.\u201d H2GO Power joined Imperial\u2019s White City Incubator in 2020, and currently has offices and laboratories there and in the near-by Scale Space. Inside the partnership Within the new partnership, Baxi will provide boilers that run on pure hydrogen, while H2GO will engineer the systems needed for each application. \u201cOur teams have integration, automation and software capability, so that they can take the hydrogen boiler, and integrate it with a hydrogen storage system and a hydrogen production system,\u201d Dr Abo-Hamed explains. We can take the hydrogen boiler, and integrate it with a hydrogen storage system and a hydrogen production system. Dr Enass Abo-Hamed H2GO Power While this approach will work with any production method for hydrogen, the ideal is to use green hydrogen, created using renewable sources such as solar or wind power. \u201cSince a lot of hydrogen will be generated in this way, it needs to be stored in a very controlled and a very safe way, and that\u2019s where our solution plays an important role.\u201d The system also requires software able to manage the connection between the renewable energy source, hydrogen generation and consumption. \u201cOur software is able to predict the best time to generate hydrogen, the best time to store it, and best time to use it,\u201d Dr Abo-Hamed says. \u201cWhen that is linked to demand from the user, there is no waste \u2013 economic waste, in this case \u2013 in the process. That matters, because costs are always a disadvantage with new technologies, and controlling them is the key to making them profitable and appealing to customers.\u201d Getting gas moving The partnership includes plans for an industrial-scale demonstration project, hosted by Northern Gas Networks, which will test a system for safe, carbon-neutral gas pre-heating. Before gas can be supplied to homes and businesses through the distribution network, its pressure must be reduced. This process can cause the gas to freeze, so pre-heating takes place to allow the gas to flow. Traditional pre-heating units are highly energy and cost-intensive, often burning gas to create the heat, emitting carbon dioxide in the process. The system that H2GO Power and Baxi will test, called heat-in-the-box, sets out to lower the cost of pre-heating, while cutting out additional carbon emissions entirely. \u201cIf successful, the pilot will be a game changer for the UK and beyond,\u201d says Dr Abo-Hamed. \u201cWe are also pleased to have the backing of the UK government from its \u00a31 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, which will go a long way in delivering our long-term ambition to reduce energy costs while playing a role in the transition.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Digitalisation has made customers more self-reliant and less afraid of switching loyalties. \u201cBanks will be inviting customers back,\u201d says Trott, but the customer journey will be more tailored and purposeful and include non-financial products that help customers deal with challenges in housing, mobility and e-commerce.\u201d Moving into the metaverse Trott says the metaverse will be one of the biggest trends in banking for years to come. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine everything the metaverse will encompass and it\u2019s still a way off, but the trajectory is emerging.\u201d \u2013 Alex Trott, Banking Sector Lead, Accenture Australia and New Zealand Banking\u2019s leadership and cultures must catch up to the new demands of a more mobile, in-demand talent pool. \u201cIn the year ahead, we expect to see more banks changing their talent strategy: acknowledging the realities of the employment market and taking a more deliberate approach to aligning talent with the demands of the business strategy.\u201d He says data will be treated like a product and help unlock the value it holds to help fundamentally change the way banking is done. \u201cThe real opportunity for banks that organise their data as a product is to collect the information once and then use it repeatedly,\u201d he says. \u2018Customer insights could be unlocked to sell new products proactively, and AI could help relationship managers in real time to dramatically improve customer interactions.\u201d The role of fintech and digital-only banks is likely to diminish, and banks should be able to reassert themselves as the \u201crightful owners of banking\u201d if they can develop or acquire market advantages and new technologies at reasonable prices and use these to enter new markets or expand their offerings. Banks will need to upskill on the personalisation of their offerings and focus on customer \u201cintent\u201d beyond the initial customer \u201cjourney\u201d. Tackling legacy environments and creating modern banking operating systems for the next decades will be key to banks\u2019 success in delivering more than their competitors. Risk is back, and the race to net zero Banks globally set aside around $834 billion in anticipation of a wave of credit losses due to the pandemic, but many came through relatively unscathed. However, the provision for an increase in delinquencies is up 9% on the same time in the previous year. \u201cClearly, banks believe the risk is back,\u201d says Trott. On top of all of these changes, Trott says that banks are under growing pressure \u2013 by regulators as well as the gamut of their stakeholders \u2013 to play a constructive role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThey are expected not only to become carbon neutral in their own right but also to help \u2026 customers to transition to net zero. If these companies cannot or are reluctant to shrink their carbon footprint, banks will increasingly be expected to impose a risk premium or basically a higher cost of lending.\u201d Look back on the week that was with hand-picked articles from Australia and around the world.

Nissan will also share the same platform like we used to see the Duster Terrano duo in the Indian market. International Hub In Chennai The alliance wants to make India as the hub of their exports. The new products will not only be sold in the domestic market but will also be exported to the international markets. For this, the alliance will boost their Chennai plant utilisation to 80 percent. With the increase in production, they will create up to 2000 new jobs at their plant. Carbon Neutral Vehicle Manufacturing Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Limited has also announced their roadmap to carbon neutrality. They have an ongoing programme to transition to 100 percent renewable energy. They are also reducing energy consumption at the plant by 50 percent compared to today. Currently, the plant sources more than 50 percent of its electricity from renewables, including solar, biomass and wind. The existing solar plant will become more than six times bigger, expanding to a 14MW plant from 2.2MW today. New Partnership Renault and Nissan are realigning their shareholding in their joint operations.
