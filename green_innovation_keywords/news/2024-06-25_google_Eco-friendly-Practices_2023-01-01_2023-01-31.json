The brands are seeing a steep rise in positive sentiments in product adoption as the latent need to get together and celebrate what was significantly subdued due to the pandemic. Nearly 65 percent of households across the country plan to spend during the current festive season, according to a new survey by LocalCircles. With pent-up demand and the opening up of travel and leisure, the phenomenon of revenge spending is expected to drive up demand this season. Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands are aggressively pursuing their own strategies to woo customers. In a bid to build up their pandemic-induced growth, D2C brands like IGP, Zouk, Solethreads, and The Tribe Concepts are ramping up their offerings, building their inventory as well as increasing tech capabilities and marketing functions. Ramping Up Product Offerings Keeping in mind that stylish casual wear is in vogue during these times, Solethreads is coming up with footwear designs that will amp up the style quotient of Millennials and GenZ. For this festive season, the brand is currently focusing on open footwear including flip-flops, slippers, and slides, and is aggressively working on launching other categories in the casual footwear segment soon. Its average current price point range is between Rs 700-800. \u201cOur experience and engagement strategies consist of one core philosophy of being 'design-led' as product design is the precursor to any kind of interaction that a customer will have with a product on any channel, whether it is just browsing a product, buying it, or even recommending it. We provide sustainable and recycled footwear and to promote upcycling and circular fashion, we have launched the 'reuse program' where consumers can replace their old flip flops for new ones,\u201d Sumant Kakaria, CEO and Founder, Solethreads said. Meanwhile, Zouk claims that during the festive season, consumers pick more India-inspired products. The brand\u2019s most popular choices remain its Indian office bags and tote bags. Zouk will also see good movement in its slings and handbags, given people buy products as gifts or for casual outings. As travel has picked up, the brand is also seeing a good uptick in its backpacks also. This festive season, Zouk has added office bellies along with a new collection of casual flats and sandals. Furthermore, with a request from its consumers to add a gift box option, the brand has added the same across all its products. \u201cOffice bags, tote bags, and sling bags would be the personal favorite for the season. The average price range for the category would be between Rs 1,000-2,000. In footwear, we believe bellies, chappals, and casual flats are our bestsellers and the average price range would be between Rs 800-2,500,\u201d Disha Singh, Founder and CEO, Zouk stated. IGP, too, expands its offerings every festive season in gifting, fashion accessories, floral bouquets, sweets, cakes, etc. This festive season, it has also launched a new collection of gift products, all revamped to cater to the latest vogue. \u201cOur gifting products will come in customized packaging to add to the festivities. Gourmet sweets, festive fashion apparel, festive essentials, and accessories are always the most searched categories on our portal, and customers tend to spend lavishly on products under these categories, making them the bestsellers every festive season,\u201d Tarun Joshi, Founder and CEO, IGP asserted. Similarly, The Tribe Concepts already has festive gifting which contributes to a major portion of its festive sales. The brand has a lineup of much-requested minis and a new skincare line targeted at pigmentation. Apart from this, it has products that address issues head to toe - so it\u2019s very flexible and easy for its buyers to make customizations of their own. \u201cSkincare continues to be our best seller category - come winter it is going to increase more as we are having new launches planned for skin care and hair care as a category has seen stable growth. Bring a gateway brand our average price point range from Rs 800-1,200,\u201d Amritha Varshini Gaddam, Founder and CEO, The Tribe Concepts added. Revamping Supply Chain Network Solethreads is opening up new warehouses and regional fulfillment centers in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata to cater to the high demand. Similarly, Zouk has massively scaled its supply chain to build up inventory for the festive season. It has also set up a strong collaboration with Amazon and Myntra, to expand its reach beyond its own website. Both of these will ensure it can get its products in the hands of more Indian consumers. \u201cOne of the key concerns from our customers has been that our products get sold out very fast. To counter it, we have enhanced our inventory so that we can ensure more consumers across India get to carry a Zouk bag or wear a Zouk footwear,\u201d Singh explained. IGP has a global footprint with customers spanning 100+ countries and the capability to deliver gifts to over 150+ countries and 1,000+ cities in India. It is currently expanding its delivery network through dark stores and is looking to automate wherever possible. \u201cWe are in the process of expanding our dark stores' network to more than 120 new dark stores pan India that will further bolster our already impressive fulfillment infrastructure of existing 40 dark stores that 3 mother warehouses support,\u201d Joshi said. Integration of Technology IGP has automated online procedures, warehouse, and operations management software, etc., to cater the best services to our customers this festive season, while The Tribe Concepts has strengthened all its Analytics divisions by dashboarding all the reports and implementing SAP for smoother on-ground operations. Solethreads has proprietary formulations and technologies like Superfoam footbeds and Ecotread soles and it is working on a newer formulation to provide the next level of comfort. All its product launches are use case based and it has launched concepts like grass slippers, all-terrain anti-skid, yoga mat slippers, etc. this year which have already become its bestsellers. \u201cWith more than 30 design and technology patents under our umbrella already, our constant endeavor is to keep innovating for our consumers,\u201d Kakaria said. Zouk believes in the power of live commerce and hence has planned a bunch of live sessions on its Instagram handle and has done a couple with Flipkart too. \u201cThese have already seen great engagement and that is a big way for us as an online brand to break the barrier and answer questions that online consumers always have,\u201d Singh claimed. Sales Target During the festive season, The Tribe Concepts is looking forward to gaining more sales from its website. It plans to close the festive year on a high by clocking in at least Rs 5 crore worth of business on books. Zouk claims that it has already started very strong on marketplaces like Amazon and Myntra, while its own website continues to be big and that wave will now continue from here till next March. \u201cIn the past 2 years, a lot has changed, even Zouk as a brand. This has helped the brand grow over 16X from pre-pandemic. We now have over 2.5 lakh happy customers across every state in India. We expect this pace to continue and we will do more sales this year compared to last year,\u201d Singh stated. IGP believes that its superior design-to-delivery consumer experience, farm-to-table supply chain, and extensive same-day delivery network can cater to the rising demand for festive gifting from Tier-II and III cities. \u201cThe pandemic did impact the overall sales last year. However, we are expecting an increment of approximately 100 percent in sales this festive season,\u201d Joshi noted. READ MORE: Consumers Expected To Spend Higher This Festive Season Future Outlook At present, IGP provides same-day delivery to almost 400+ cities in India and 24 to 72-hour delivery in over 1,000 cities. In addition to the mentioned figures, the brand plans to mark its presence exponentially in Tier-II and III cities nationwide. In the next two years, IGP aims to be the largest and most preferred destination for all special purchases. \u201cWe also look forward to increasing our brand footprint in the commercially sound international markets of North America, the UK, and Australia,\u201d Joshi said. Zouk is present in 30+ multi-brand outlets on the offline side. The brand looks to expand this offline retail presence further in the coming quarters. Solethreads is also going full throttle to increase its retail footprint in the Indian market. It eyes to establish its presence in 2000 MBOs until the end of this financial year. \u201cThis is roughly 5X than our current retail footprint. Apart from these 2000 retail MBOs, we are also foraying into large format retail stores this fiscal year,\u201d Kakaria informed. The Tribe Concepts is also looking forward to expanding its online channels and offline stores by having exclusive stores for the brand. \u201cWe are looking more forward to expanding the business, targeting new audiences, and witnessing an increase in the conversions,\u201d Gaddam concluded.","filter_flag":1}

With festivities around the corner, there has been a significant surge in demand in the markets which are flooded with consumers. Every industry is witnessing the surge, and Beauty and Personal Care is not behind. However, the stiff competition for customers between online and offline brands has become more prominent than ever. To understand the commotion among the brands this season, these brands give us an insight into their 2022 journey and their 2023 growth plans. SUGAR Cosmetics This year SUGAR Cosmetics touched larger milestones, becoming one of the select few brands that have launched 120+ of their own stores in retail, reaching a total of 45000+ retail touchpoints across 550+ cities. SUGAR\u2019s IG page garnered 2.4M+ followers, becoming the largest consumer brand in India on the platform, along with our experiment into gamified AR filters that hit virality on platforms like Instagram and Moj. The brand\u2019s #ShukarHaiSUGARHai Campaign with campaign ambassadors Ranveer Singh and Tamannaah Bhatia was also a huge viral success allowing the brand to receive support from impactful investors namely LCatterton and Ranveer Singh. \u201cAt SUGAR in 2022, we managed to almost double our sales over the previous year, achieved the target of being one of the Top 3 brands in color cosmetics in India, and are looking at another year of massive growth,\u201d said Vineeta Singh, Co-founder, and CEO, SUGAR Cosmetics. She further added, \u201cOur plans for 2023 include targeting and achieving a 100 percent Y-O-Y revenue growth over last year, expansion to more than 60,000 retail outlets, making our D2C platform base stronger and larger, and growing our team size to 3,000 employees.\u201d Keeping its audience in mind, SUGAR is looking forward to tapping into different categories of the beauty industry. The brand will also focus on creating solid content to keep educating and engaging its community across all platforms\u2013digital and others. The Body Shop \"We at The Body Shop are embarking upon a new strategy of \u2018Change Making Beauty\u2019, which means that we aim to empower customers, employees, and partners to drive positive change for the world through our channels, our products, and our activism,\" stated Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, South Asia. With this vision, the brand is aligned to reach its goal of 25 new stores in 2022 at various locations. Currently, having 200 highly visible and accessible stores all over India, including Tier I and II cities, with the latest additions in Itanagar, Surat, and Indore. The brand's current product portfolio is already over 60 percent Vegan, aiming to become 100 percent Vegan by 2023. This aim is the natural next step forward for the brand's Cruelty-Free commitment, including reformulating all our core products from 100 percent Vegetarian to 100 percent Vegan, while focusing on making its product packaging 100 percent recyclable thus reducing its environmental impact. \"We are strengthening our retail and e-commerce channels by opening more workshop stores and launching new digital experiences. We are expanding our retail footprint with a clear focus on smaller cities and towns. Rolling out the new Workshop store format in as many stores as possible: 30+ new ACTIVIST Workshop stores per year, every year till 2025 bringing the brand to people where they love to shop,\" added Chaturvedi. Plum Plum would be closing the financial year at over 2x the revenue of the previous FY, complemented by the 44 percent growth seen in its overall customer base with a 96.54 percent increase in repeat buyers which is a great win in the D2C space. \u201cWe raised $35 million (Rs 270 crore) in a Series C round in March 2022 totaling our funding to over $50 million. With this, our efforts have been towards bringing in more salient brand communication, growing our omnichannel presence and onboarding high-quality talent with a focus on investments in marketing and technology,\u201d said Shankar Prasad, Founder & CEO, Plum Having launched over 8 exclusive brand outlets in the last year across cities, the brand plans to scale this up to 50 in the coming year. Furthermore, Plum onboarded Rashmika Mandanna and Mithila Palkar as its brand ambassadors for the Plum skincare range and Ananya Panday for the Plum Body Lovin\u2019 fragrance range. \u201cWe would be expanding our makeup range aggressively with a host of innovative product formats in the coming year. We would also be launching a line of products in the essentials and advanced ranges under both skincare and haircare categories,\u201d added Prasad. Colorbar The post-pandemic period has witnessed a radical shift in consumer behavior and expectations. As per research, the total retail sale is expected to reach $5.5 trillion by 2027 with online sales making up 30 percent of the market. The retail industry has been largely shadowed by challenges across the supply chain, economic uncertainty, and geo-political factors. I feel that going forward, the only way for retailers to sail through is by exhibiting strong levels of adaptability, agility, and flexibility. \"As we graduate into the next year, we can expect a renewed focus on enhancing the customer shopping journey by providing a seamless experience for hybrid shopping. Re-invention of physical store designs along with a robust omnichannel strategy would, however, emerge as a top priority. Many companies will be seen adding features to support new shopping initiatives while integrating technologies supporting AR\/VR advancements. We are aligned to lead the change and have a strong conviction that our strategy would create benchmarks of excellence in 2023,\u201d stated Samir Kumaar Modi, Founder, and Managing Director, Colorbar Cosmetics. Kapiva \u201cWe have been relentlessly working towards improving the health and wellness quotient of Indians with Ayurveda. Recently, we expanded in the US and UAE to enable this for the global audience as well. Our focus this year was on increasing the effectiveness of our products. We\u2019ve moved the needle on that front by successfully conducting a clinical trial for our Dia Free Juice. It has also proven to be effective in decreasing HbA1c to an extent of 11 percent and increasing insulin production in the body by up to 25-30 percent. However, the highlight of the year was definitely the recognition by Honorable PM Modi,\u201d said Ameve Sharma, Founder, Kapiva. In the upcoming year, Kapiva aims to double down, concurrently increasing brand awareness and recall to become a household name. Modern consumers are less concerned with outward appearance than they once were, and are more concerned with their complete well-being, which encompasses physical, mental, and emotional health. In order to capitalize on this trend, Kapiva is constantly creating consumer awareness by keeping the emphasis on the paramount importance of Ayurveda and how it can enable people to live a holistic lifestyle. Earth Rhythm 2022 was a favorable year for Earth Rhythm, as it brought in a lot of positive changes in terms of organization, growth, and product. At an organizational level, the brand was able to double the size of the team with its customer base growing 4x times compared to the previous financial year. The brand also went offline with the launch of its exclusive kiosks at 12 different locations across India. \u201cWe are expanding our makeup category which will go on to strengthen Earth Rhythm\u2019s wide-ranging portfolio, we have also been intensifying the existing categories. True to our digital-first identity, it was also a natural step for us to continue investing in technology in a bid to further streamline operations and give our customers every convenience they desire. We successfully launched our very own mobile App for both Android and iOS platforms this year and have been gaining steady traction on it. Next year, we plan to further build our portfolio by deepening the makeup category launched in 2022. We reckon 2x growth over FY 2021-22,\u201d said Harini Sivakumar, Founder, and CEO, Earth Rhythm. In keeping with this shift in the consumer\u2019s preference, the brand aims to reinforce its multifunctional product range in both makeup and personal care (face, body, hair), aimed at eliminating the need for and use of multiple products in everyday makeup and skincare routines. ARATA This year at Arata launched over 20 products and 30 offline stores across India, steadily growing 10 percent month on month with respect to GMV. \u201cIn the upcoming year, we will go full throttle to bridge the gaps in our product line and be a one-stop shop for all hair care needs. We have already begun our groundwork and have set processes to create formulas in the anti-hair fall, hair colorants, and hair styling segments,\u201d said Dhruv Madhok, Co-Founder, ARATA. BlushBee 2022 has been the year of the first full-fledged operations for Blushbee. Beginning with just three products and later expanding to 10 categories with 64 unique SKUs, the brand has witnessed massive organic growth in its customer base. BlushBee as a cosmetics line is a product of careful decisions in choosing what it wants, the other advantage is that being a clean and green beauty brand which is an important factor in the value proposition. \u201cWe hope to grow into a one-stop shop for all things related to color cosmetics, so we are actively looking into introducing new products like foundations, gloss, and so on. We have also discussed extending our horizons beyond just the realm of color cosmetics very soon,\u201d stated Shobana and Navneethan, Founders, BlushBee Organic Beauty Brand. Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co The brand was launched in 2022 with the mindset of embracing the true self and exploring the crazy side. The brand is PETA and IFRA certified, FDA approved, and currently provides the best possible sensorial experience in Hair Care with India's First Date Seed Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Hair Oil. \u201cIn the short term, we are working towards expanding on two fronts- launching more affordable luxury products across categories in which we operate. With the right set of team, products, and marketing strategy we were able to launch our brand, and today, 6 months post the launch we are happy to serve more than 2000+ households,\u201d commented Damanjit Kohli and Karishma Sahni, Founders, Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co. Increasing its touchpoint and interaction with the product, currently, Crazy Owl has signed up on all major marketplace platforms \u2013 Amazon Launchpad, Flipkart Propel Program, Purple, Snapdeal, Tata 1 mg, First cry, Myntra, Nykaa, Bigbasket and will be launching itself on Blink it, Paytm, Pharmeasy and Shopperstop planning to grow its channel every month. Pilgrim \u201cAs one of the fastest growing personal care brands in India, we have seen significant growth in the last 12 months and clocked a sale of Rs 10 crore per month along with a growth of 6X. With the trust that the brand has built throughout, we have had some great partnerships this year for our campaigns. Celebrity shout-outs from personalities like Soha Ali Khan, and Vidya Balan, and association with Kalki Koechlin in our most recent commercial have been one of the key highlights,\u201d said Anurag, Co-Founder and CEO, Pilgrim. With a strong consumer base of 1 million, the brand aims to improve its interaction and thus upgraded its technology. Along with updating its technology, the brand is also using innovative ways to reach its target audience. Pilgrim aims to be a Rs 1,000 crore brand in the next 3-4 years by facilitating new product and category launches and exploring newer international markets like the Middle East. Moreover, planning to double down on its R&D capabilities and increase brand investments by bringing in global experiences for its customers, both online and offline. Along with establishing its presence internationally, Pilgrim aims to achieve an annualized run rate of Rs 500 crore by December 2023. iluvia Professional As a new-age, self-care brand pioneering product-driven innovation and technology, during the course of the year iluvia witnessed growth across different channels, and new launches, and hit several milestones. The organization has grown 25x in revenue between October 2021 and 2022 along with a 20x growth in its online consumer base, currently present across key marketplaces and in over 1800 salons in India across 70+ cities. \u201cIt is a very exciting time for us as we are working on introducing new patented treatment technologies and new launches in the haircare category. We also expect a positive growth trajectory of 6x to 7x in the coming year,\u201d stated Nishant Gupta and Palash Pandey, Directors, Renaura Wellness Pvt. Ltd. Beauty and Skincare, as a category, has burst forth since the onset of the pandemic in late 2019. The D2C space, especially, has seen remarkable growth which we expect will continue in 2023 and beyond. Moreover, The Indian beauty and personal care segment, which stood above Rs 54,500 crore only two years ago, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11 percent over the next five years.","filter_flag":1}

Download ETAuto App Get Realtime updates Save your favourite articles Scan to download App By Anshuman Singhania India \u2019s tyre segment is driven by multiple tailwinds prevalent in the automotive industry . Besides being the world\u2019s largest two- and three-wheeler manufacturer , India is the second-largest bus and tractor manufacturer and the third-largest heavy truck maker and the fourth-largest car producer. Thanks to its robust numbers, the country is slated to emerge as the third-largest automotive market globally in volume terms by 2030.There are other reasons why the good times for the tyre industry will keep gathering momentum. One of them is the Centre\u2019s decision to allocate USD 3.5 billion under the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme for the automobile sector. The PLI scheme proposes fiscal incentives of up to 18%, aiming to enhance indigenous manufacturing of automotive technology goods and attracting investments in the auto-making value chain.Naturally, the burgeoning production of automobiles is pushing the demand for tyres, propelling the industry\u2019s growth. As per the latest statistics, the tyre industry crossed exports of INR 21,000 crore in FY22, recording around 50% value growth compared to last year \u2013 the segment\u2019s all-time high.The anticipated rise in domestic demand for tyres will be driven by robust growth from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), a moderate rise in replacement volumes and the lower prices of crude oil derivatives and natural rubber.Domestic demand apart, exports represent another huge opportunity for the tyre industry. The faster recovery of many markets in North America and Europe, anti-dumping duties on Chinese products and several nations opting for a China-plus-one policy are all good news for domestic tyre makers. Presently, tyres manufactured in the country are exported to more than 170 nations, including North America and Europe. While the US remains India\u2019s largest market for tyres with almost 20% of the overall numbers exported, Germany, Brazil, the UK and France are part of the top five export markets.Another key element for Indian tyre manufacturers to remember is the emerging demand for EVs ( electric vehicles ). Autonomous and intelligent vehicles apart, EVs comprise a subset of new mobility. In plying new mobility vehicles, tyres are one of the prime enablers.While the fundamentals of tyre making would largely remain the same, tyres for new mobility vehicles will witness innovations in materials and the embedding of sensors. In context, it may be mentioned that JK Tyre has introduced smart tyres embedded with sensors. This optimises fuel efficiency and, in addition to enhancing the product\u2019s value proposition, contributes to sustainability goals.Now the governments are incentivising the transition towards EVs. Typically, as EVs are heavier than conventional cars, their tyres must be sturdy and possess better load capacity. Since EVs have a better pickup, tyre wear and tear also needs to be lower. Furthermore, for facilitating a smooth driving experience, the tyres should generate minimal noise and vibration and have a higher torque. JK Tyre has developed technologies to cater to the special needs of EV and recently launched its complete range of EV tyres.As the deployment of EVs gains momentum across the two-, three- and four-wheeler segments, tyre-makers will need to raise their game with new designs and other innovations. Since EVs are essentially silent, sound-absorbing materials must be used to minimise the rolling noise. Smart tyres do just that via low rolling resistance and aerodynamically-designed side walls, which help prolong battery life. All the above elements and innovations are indispensable for tyre makers since tyres must be ahead of the vehicle manufacturing curve, considering their pivotal role in maintaining vehicle stability.Moreover, manufacturers must adhere to the new norms for tyres as mandated by MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways). Accordingly, new tyres for passenger cars, trucks and buses should meet the predetermined guidelines for wet grip, rolling sound emissions and rolling resistance. These norms help ensure better outcomes on fuel savings while meeting mandatory safety requirements.For example, the rolling resistance of tyres plays a major role in ensuring fuel efficiency. Conversely, wet grip capability is important in a vehicle\u2019s braking performance, particularly under wet conditions. Through these mandatory norms, the authorities aim to make commuting cost-effective, fuel-efficient and safer. Therefore, all current tyre designs must comply with the mandatory Automotive Industry Standards.Finally, the Central Government\u2019s focus on all-round development and infrastructure growth is giving a fillip to vehicle manufacturers, especially commercial ones, in turn benefitting the tyre industry. Additionally, the PLI scheme, the Make in India mission and other programmes have generated a high tide of growth for all automotive entities.(Anshuman Singhania is the Managing Director of JK Tyre & Industries Ltd.
