When comparing two identical vehicles with equal stiffness and load-carrying capacity-- one made of aluminum, the other of steel--the aluminum vehicle body will be up to 45% lighter, which provides many advantages that will affect the future of the automotive industry. Alumobility Alumobility's Technical Director, Professor Mark White outlines the Top 8 Reasons Why When it Comes to Aluminum, Less is More, which are highlighted in Alumobility's newly published white paper of the same name. LESS WEIGHT = MORE EFFICIENCY: There are efficiency advantages of aluminum lightweighting in Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) as well as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. ICE vehicles manufactured from aluminum have better mileage, consume less fuel and produce less emissions. BEV's do not run on fossil fuels but still require energy to move so the lighter weight of an Aluminum Intensive Vehicle (AIV) improves range capability. Because electric vehicle batteries can weigh as much as 2000 pounds, automakers are embracing the lightweighting benefits of aluminum as the market shifts to electrification. LESS WEIGHT = MORE SECONDARY SAVINGS: A lighter aluminum body means a car can use smaller parts, including brakes, suspension parts, batteries, motors, yet achieve the same acceleration, performance and range with less emissions. (INQUIRE WHETHER ALL PARTS ARE SMALLER) In BEV's, smaller batteries translate not only to greater range in traveling but also less extraction of raw materials and chemicals for manufacturing, which helps to protect the earth's resources. The overall manufacturing of AIVs versus steel is more efficient in terms of materials and labor. This means that in addition to primary weight savings of, for example, 160 kg which is achieved by replacing 400 kg of steel with 240 kg of aluminum, the vehicle will also have another 40 to 60 kg savings in the weight of other materials savings. LESS WEIGHT = MORE SAFETY: It is a common misconception that heavy cars are safer than light ones, but lighter weight AIVs are safer than those made of steel. Aluminum absorbs more energy that steel per Kg (lb.), so a lightweight aluminum vehicle can even be safer for the occupant than a comparable steel-based vehicle. When kinetic energy is absorbed in a controlled manner, vehicle occupants will be better protected from intrusion into the safety cell. In addition to being safer for vehicle occupants, an AIV is safer for everyone else--occupants of other vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians, as it carries less mass into any accident, therefore less energy to be absorbed. LESS WEIGHT = MORE DURABILITY: Since aluminum vehicles are lighter, they create less friction on key components such as tires and brakes. Less friction means that materials such as rubber and plastic emit fewer particle emissions and with less wear and tear, are expected to have a longer vehicle lifespan. LESS CORROSION = MORE YEARS IN SERVICE: Automotive grades of aluminum alloys are less prone to corrosion due to the self-healing, protective barrier that forms in milliseconds when cracked, dented, or deformed. Unlike automotive steel grades, which are inherently susceptible to rust and rely on protective systems for durability, aluminum does not need a protective coating, even in severe environments. LESS WEIGHT = MORE PAYLOAD AND TOWING CAPACITY: Pick-up trucks, SUVs and last mile delivery vehicles manufactured from aluminum can carry more cargo and\/or have the potential for overall weight reduction compared to a steel reference vehicle. The lighter weight vehicles made of aluminum have a reduced impact on the roads, protecting an older infrastructure from extra wear and costly repairs. The lightweight aluminum body and chassis can enable secondary weights savings and result in lower cost per mile in running costs. LESS COMPLEXITY = MORE EFFICIENCY IN MANUFACTURING: Compared to a steel-intensive vehicle, the process to manufacture an AIV requires fewer parts, translating to less complexity. AIVs require less of the following: tools, robots, joints, energy, factory emissions, less inventory, capital and sealers. These parts will be made from fewer alloys, allowing for simpler end-of-life recycling. More than 90% of a vehicle's aluminum can be recovered and recycled--so an aluminum-intensive car at the end of its life can be recycled and practically made into another car body. LESS WASTE = MORE CIRCULARITY: More sustainable than steel, aluminum is infinitely recyclable without a loss in its qualities, including lightness, durability and formability. Recycling aluminum scrap in a closed loop process allows vehicle manufacturers to reduce their carbon emissions immediately while end-of-life recycling offers an opportunity for future reductions. Steel is recyclable but it is important to know that it melts at 1400 degrees centigrade whereas aluminum melts at less than half that temperature, at 650 degrees. Since vehicles are manufactured with 600 kg or less of aluminum for every metric ton of steel, the energy savings of aluminum are noteworthy. In conclusion, there are numerous benefits for accelerating aluminum use in motor vehicles. As outlined, infinitely recyclable, lightweight aluminum provides clearly defined advantages demonstrating its superiority as the material of the future for mobility.

At the same time, global consumption of fashion has increased by 400%, while overall usage of products has dropped by about 40%. These are all realities that Coach has had to face head on as one of the top fashion and leather goods brands in the world. The brand has worked for many years to improve the sustainability of its operations and mitigate its environmental impact across the value chain. While these efforts, including the Coach Re(Loved) repair and refurbishment initiatives, have been critical, they weren\u2019t sufficient, explained Joon Silverstein, SVP of Global Marketing, Creative and Sustainability at Coach and Head of Coachtopia during the Retail Influencer CEO Forum in New York City. Through the creation of Coachtopia, a new brand that operates separately from the core Coach business, the brand is tapping into its rich legacy while embracing a start-up mentality to completely rethink the way fashion items are designed, crafted and recycled. \u201cFundamentally, we needed to address the core challenge of fashion, which is that it is a linear and unsustainable system,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cWe had to face that realization head on, that Coach is part of that linear, unsustainable system contributing to climate change. And therefore, the only way to truly transform our impact was to rethink the end-to-end system; to go outside the linear system and think about how to reimagine it in a circular way.\u201d Although Coachtopia has only existed since April 2023, the brand has made a big splash and has helped Coach stand out as a pioneer in the circular fashion industry. And it also quickly is becoming a fan favorite among Gen Z consumers. With sights set on growth, Coachtopia is ensuring its approach to circularity is clear, impactful and scalable. The business currently operates as a separate sub-brand so it could operate as a startup and \u201cthink radically about rethinking the system and ways of working to pioneer circularity,\u201d Silverstein said. But the goal ultimately is to apply and scale these learnings so Coach can be circular too. \u201cAs we develop learnings and scalable processes that will feed back into Coach and Coachtopia, we\u2019ll move on to tackle additional problems,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cThe whole purpose is eventually to move Coach and the overall industry.\u201d Creating a Brand that Gen Z Loves Aesthetically, Coachtopia is a brand designed for Gen Z. Colorful charm necklaces are reminiscent of summer camp art projects and the brand\u2019s \u201cWavy Dinky\u201d handbag comes in a range of out-there patterns \u2014 from cherries to mushrooms and checkerboard. But this \u201cfun and cool\u201d vibe isn\u2019t the only draw for Gen Z, according to Silverstein. Coachtopia aims to create a \u201cmore hopeful vision\u201d that relies on Gen Z\u2019s active participation to grow and thrive. \u201cThe way we engage Gen Z is part of the brand\u2019s success,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cWe always think about the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018why,\u2019 but the \u2018how\u2019 is equally important to us. And it\u2019s powered by community. Since the earliest days, when Coachtopia was just a nugget in our brain before we even named it, we had engaged a growing group of Gen Z across all walks of life: Designers, climate activists, journalists, filmmakers, entrepreneurs, fashion enthusiasts, people who care. And we\u2019ve been pressure testing and involving them and co-creating with them at every step.\u201d Coachtopia partnered with JUV Consulting, a Gen Z consulting agency, to better engage and resonate with Gen Z communities. The brand taps these community insights to garner feedback and perspectives that will drive the future of the brand. This \u201cholistic community\u201d also has become a powerful platform for change. In fact, Coachtopia is investing in talent by creating circular design scholarships like the Coachtopia Catalyst Fund, which was designed to support emerging sustainability non-profits led by the Gen Z community. Developing Consistent, Scalable Processes for Circular Fashion Silverstein admitted that \u201ccircularity\u201d has become an industry buzzword with inconsistent definitions, which means it could lose value and impact over time. That\u2019s why the Coachtopia team focused on establishing a clear definition of circularity that would drive product development, marketing and any form of customer communication. \u201cIt was really important to us that we defined what we meant by circularity, so our customers knew exactly what it meant too,\u201d she explained. Coachtopia established the Made Circular design principles to inform how the brand designs, crafts and reuses its products: Advertisement Principle 1: Craft with recycled, repurposed or renewable materials The creation of new virgin raw materials accounts for more than 38% of fashion\u2019s greenhouse gas use, Silverstein shared. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with the problems in our backyard, and we\u2019re taking the waste we generate as a brand at Coach and using our creativity to reconsider that waste as a valuable raw material in new products.\u201d As a leather brand, Coactopia is prioritizing leather waste by taking all the extra scraps from new bag creation and using these small, sometimes uneven scraps of material for new product creation.
