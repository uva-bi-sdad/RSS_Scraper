RECD is built on filter-less technology and based on Electrostatic Precipitation fundamentals. It captures Particulate Matter (PM) from the engine exhaust with more than 70 per cent efficiency. Meeting compliance requirement Commenting on the product launch, Sanjay Jadhav, CEO, Sterling Generators Private Limited said,\u201cWe are happy to collaborate with Pi Green Innovations for their RECD technology. This collaboration provides an excellent opportunity to expand and enhance the product offerings we offer to our customers. The newly launched RECD is highly efficient in improving air quality and provides a viable solution for our customers to meet the PM compliance requirement, as per pollution control board norms.\u201d \u201cAt Sterling Generators, we believe that environmental sustainability is a shared responsibility, and this collaboration reflects our dedication to finding cleaner, more efficient solutions for our customers and our planet. Together with Pi Green Innovations, we aim to redefine how the industry addresses air pollution, setting a new standard for cleaner energy solutions\u201d, he added. Reusing particulate matter The RECD is installed after the DG exhaust (muffler\/silencer), and no modifications to the engine\/ DG set are required. What sets this technology apart is its ability to transform the separated particulate matter\/ byproduct and reuse it as a high-value raw material in paints, dyes, toners for laser printers and copiers as well as in a vulcanization process to treat rubber, thus eliminating the need for disposal and secondary contamination. The product is all weatherproof, needs minimal maintenance with a simple, efficient, and sturdy construction that provides constant performance and long operational life. Prestigious partnership Speaking at the launch event, Irfan Pathan, Founder & CEO, Pi Green Innovations noted, \u201cWe are honoured and proud to partner with a prestigious brand like Sterling Generators. This partnership not only gives a boost to the DG retrofit (RECD) industry in India but also adds impetus to Pi Green\u2019s vision of A Pollution Free Tomorrow.\u201d Also read:Sterling Generators Wins Rs.510 Crore Orders In FY23 Featured photograph shows Sanjay Jadhav, CEO, Sterling Generators (left) andIrfan Pathan, Founder & CEO, Pi Green Innovations, at the launch of RECD in Pune, on September 11, 2023","filter_flag":1}

BMW has unveiled a significantly updated mid-range adventure bike lineup for 2024. Boasting a bump in capacity, the three new models include a thoroughly overhauled F900GS, a mile-munching F900GS Adventure and an A2-friendly F800GS released to replace the F850 and 750 platform. All three new models from the Bavarian manufacturer will feature a 895 cc (previously 853 cc) powerplant with a 270\/450 degree firing interval. While the detuned F800GS delivers 87 horsepower, the 900 machines pump out a claimed 105 hp \u2013 up from the 95 hp of the outgoing 850 machine. That peak power output out-punches established models like Honda\u2019s Africa Twin and is on par with the KTM 890 Adventure. However, the F900GS and F900GS Adventure\u2019s increase in torque is more modest, going from 67.9 lb-ft to 68.6 lb-ft but BMW says the new engines have a much fuller torque curve, increased pulling power and faster acceleration so it remains to be seen how that translates into the real world. The most notable changes are seen in the F900GS though, which is not only slimmer but also lighter at 483 lbs (219 kg) wet \u2014 shaving off 31 lbs (14 kg) compared to the predecessor model. The weight reduction is in part due to the newly-developed 14.5-liter plastic fuel tank (0.5 L smaller) which saves 9.9 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight compared to the steel tank of the previous model. The revamped F900GS also features new close-fitting tank side panels, a new radiator trim and a completely redesigned rear section, which shaves around 5.3 lbs (2.4 kg) and an additional 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg) is saved thanks to the Akrapovi\u010d silencer. ADVERTISEMENT To optimize the F900GS for off-road use, BMW has also updated its ergonomic triangle (handlebar \u2013 seat \u2013 footrests). The bike now features lower footrests, a higher handlebar position and a new foot brake lever in a higher position. All three new models offer an adjustable gear shift lever as standard. In conjunction with an optimized bearing and new gearshift lever kinematics, it was also possible to optimize shifting the six-speed transmission even further. The F900GS still rolls on 21\u201d\/17\u201d wheels but now has new, fully-adjustable USD Showa forks and boasts longer legs to match those of the Adventure variant, going from 8.0\u2033 \/ 8.6\u2033 (204 mm \/ 219 mm) of suspension travel to 9.1\u201d \/ 8.5\u201d (230 mm \/ 215 mm). The new F900GS can be given even more off-road prowess with the optional equipment ex works Enduro Pro package featuring fully-adjustable titanium nitride-coated USD 45mm Showa forks, fully-adjustable central spring strut as well as handlebar risers and an M Endurance chain. The Dynamic ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment) electronic suspension is available as optional equipment for the new F900GS Adventure and the F800GS. Compared to the predecessor model, the new LED headlight on the new BMW F900GS offers a larger low beam opening angle and thus better illumination directly in front of the motorcycle. The new F900GS Adventure and the F800GS also feature LED headlights as standard. Furthermore, the turn indicator and control lights of all three models also use LED technology. The new GS models in the F series each have a large 6.5-inch TFT display as standard with phone calling, listening to music and navigating capabilities. This applies in particular to the F800GS, which previously had an analogue display. Moreover, the new BMW F900GS is equipped with a 12 mm holder as standard, which permits action cams or other devices to be mounted.

The $2-billion-plus Anand Group, a leading manufacturer of world-class auto systems and components, has signed a joint venture (JV) with Korea\u2019s $8.1-billion HL Group. The JV will increase the size of the Indian conglomerate\u2019s aftermarket business two-fold while building the Korean entity\u2019s presence in India. The JV will expand the aftermarket portfolio with products manufactured by Anand\u2019s existing JVs with HL Group\u2019s Mando Corporation, an automotive components leader based in Korea. These existing partnerships are HL Mando Anand Automotive, which makes steering, brake, and suspension systems, and Anand Mando eMobility, which manufactures motors and controllers for EVs. The partnership will be called \u2018HL Anand Automotive Parts Pvt Ltd\u2019 and provide a wide range of aftermarket components for the passenger vehicle segment in domestic and international markets. Two dedicated distribution centres will be set up for the new company in the next two years. The Seoul-based HL Group consists of 44 companies across Asia, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Speaking about the new JV, Mahendra Goyal, co-COO of Anand Group, said: \u201cAt Anand, we have a special focus on the aftermarket business and want to grow ahead of market. This strategic JV with HL Group will significantly expand our aftermarket business in both domestic and international markets. The JV will capitalise on the strong ANAND Group aftermarket ecosystem in India and HL Group\u2019s sourcing expertise and well-established global network.\u201d He added, \u201cWith this alliance, we expect our aftermarket business to grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next five years. The company will focus on the core products manufactured by the existing JV entities and will be free to source other products, as feasible, for growth. This JV will be selling HL Mando and Anand co-branded products, building on the brand strengths of both partners.\" The Anand Group\u2019s basket of aftermarket products comprising of around 6,000 SKUs are well distributed by over 2,500 industry-leading channel partners and nine distribution centres located across the country. The JV further plans to add around 1,200 new SKUs in the next two years.\" Speaking about the JV, Joon-Bom Kim, CEO of HL Holdings, who signed the agreement at Anand\u2019s New Delhi corporate headquarters late on Tuesday, with Mr. Goyal, said: \u201cAnand Group is a highly respected auto leader in India. The coming together of HL Group, a visionary industry leader in Korea with an extensive global presence in auto and other sectors, and Anand, with its India-wide aftermarkets network, will be a positive for both businesses and help expand the opportunity-rich Indian aftermarket sector overall.\u201d India\u2019s auto aftermarket, which is growing at around 10% annually, is approximately Rs 85,000 crore ($10.6 billion), while the global aftermarket is estimated at around $408 billion, according to industry reports.","filter_flag":1}
