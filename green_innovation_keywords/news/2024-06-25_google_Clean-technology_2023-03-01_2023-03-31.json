The Clean Technology ITC was included as part of the Canadian government\u2019s 2023 Budget Day fiscal priorities on March 28, with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland releasing the government\u2019s 2023 federal budget. The Canadian government is prioritizing a clean energy economy as one of the three main pillars of its multi-year budget plan. The federal government has a goal of making its electric grid net zero by 2035 through tax incentives for clean energy projects over the next six years. Canada\u2019s Budget 2023 mirrors the IRA and includes two new ITCs targeting clean energy and technology manufacturing. In the government\u2019s remarks this week, it said the new plan allows Canada to remain competitive with its southern neighbor. In the government\u2019s 2022 Fall Economic Statement, it proposed a 30% refundable Clean Technologies ITC, available to eligible properties that are acquired or become available for use on or after March 28, 2023. In Budget 2023, the government expanded this ITC to apply to geothermal energy projects, in addition to solar, wind and energy storage. The term of the ITC was also extended from phasing out in 2032, as was intended under the 2022 proposal, and will remain at 30% through December 2033, stepping down to 15% in 2034 before phasing out altogether after 2034. A new incentive that the Canadian government is providing is a refundable 15% investment tax credit on the capital costs made by non-taxable entities. These include indigenous or tribal communities, municipal utilities and Crown-corporations that make investments in renewable energy, energy storage, interprovincial power transmission and other clean energy infrastructure projects. Popular content The ITC also applies to new hydroelectric, wave\/tidal projects, nuclear (including small modular reactors), and abated natural gas-fired generation. The Clean Hydrogen ITC was announced as part of the government\u2019s 2022 proposals. New details of the basic design elements of the hydrogen ITC include a volumetric ITC credit based on carbon intensity of the project, measured by kilograms of carbon emissions produced per kilogram of hydrogen, and meeting prescribed labor conditions. As detailed in the above chart, green hydrogen produced using the least carbon emissions and produced with claimable trained labor can see an ITC of up to 40%, while grey or blue hydrogen as its called using lesser carbon recovery can see a 5% to 25% ITC, depending on labor conditions.

As with any other building material, the manufacture and disposal of ceramic tiles have a significant influence on the environment. To understand the environmental effect of the fabrication and use of ceramic tiles, it is crucial to undertake a full lifecycle analysis. Image Credit: DUO Studio\/Shutterstock.com Need for Lifecycle Analyses of Ceramic Tiles Global urbanization is accelerating, and it is estimated that by 2050, up to 68 percent of the population will reside in urban regions. Cement, clay brick, ceramics, mortar, wood, plastic, and steel make up construction and demolition debris (CDW). The building sector has significantly contributed to the depletion of natural resources and has had profound effects on the environment; in 2019, 39% of worldwide CO2 emissions were attributable to the construction industry, with 11% due to the manufacturing of construction materials. Environmental rules and regulations are growing stricter as the demand for ecologically efficient structures continues to increase. Innovation is closely tied to economic progress, yet it is frequently accompanied by environmental damage. Thus, the appropriate use of raw materials, the implementation of sustainable power, utilizing environmentally efficient materials, and the management of environmental pollution are challenges for businesses. Assessing environmental performance necessitates an effective evaluation method that takes various elements into account. As a result of eco-innovation, several studies have stressed the need for Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). A Brief Introduction to Lifecycle Assessment Analysis Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are thorough assessments that look at the ecological footprint of a product across its whole life cycle, beginning with the extraction of raw materials and concluding with waste management. Other stages of the lifecycle, including manufacturing techniques and transportation, are also analyzed thoroughly. This instrument is used internationally to address global ecological consequences, taking into account a full product's service life. The ability to acquire quantitative carbon footprint findings associated with a product or service across its entire life cycle and to identify opportunities for improvement is one of the primary advantages of this technique. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) have become widely employed in the commercial ceramics sector to improve manufacturing system sustainability. As a result of this, life cycle assessment is now seen as a driving factor in government policy. In general, three aspects are considered: environmental, socioeconomic, and natural resource protection. The rigorous analysis of any product leads to efficient resource consumption by employing the most effective approaches available in a certain sector. In addition, LCAs are frequently used throughout the value chain, affording the possibility to evaluate the consequences and origins of a product or process in a holistic manner. The Ceramic Tile Industry Spain and Brazil have contributed to the global doubling of the ceramic tile industry via the development of new products and production techniques. The industry has two basic manufacturing processes - dry processing and wet processing - with distinct outcomes. Ceramic tiles are made via shaping and glazing. Shaping requires raw materials, slurry, forming, and drying, while glazing requires purchasing raw ingredients, generating glaze-frit, grinding and polishing, applying glaze to the ceramic body, and firing. MECS has released its global ceramic tile market projection for the next five years. According to the research 'Ceramic Tile Market Forecast Analysis - Trend 2021-2025', yearly production growth will average 5%. During the five years from 2021 to 2025, the global ceramic tile market is anticipated to expand at an average annual rate of 5% in terms of production (an extra 4.5 billion square meters by 2025) and 5.1% regarding consumption, culminating in a very minor rise in inventories. Ecological Impacts The ecological impacts of ceramic tiles could be understood by reviewing their manufacturing processes. The manufacture of ceramic tiles entails a variety of complex procedures requiring accuracy and skill. First, the raw ingredients, which commonly consist of clay, feldspar, kaolin, and other minerals, are prepared. These substances are combined in precise amounts before being processed into a fine powder. The powder is then combined with water to create a slurry, which is subsequently poured into molds. Typically, plaster is used to construct the molds, and the slurry is allowed to cure and solidify within the molds. When the tiles have been carefully removed from their molds, they undergo a procedure called firing. This is accomplished by heating the tiles to temperatures between 1,100 and 1,200 degrees Celsius in a kiln. During the firing process, the tiles become denser and more durable, and any residual moisture is pushed away. Following the fire, the tiles are examined for quality and, if necessary, glazed. Glazing includes putting a thin coating of liquid glass on the tile's surface, followed by a second firing to fuse the glaze to the tile's surface. This provides a smooth, waterproof surface to the tile and can also add aesthetic features. During the process of heating, several gases are emitted, which include large quantities of greenhouse gases. These gases contribute to ozone layer depletion and air pollution. Additionally, transporting ceramic tiles from the manufacturer to the construction site presents an additional environmental concern. Depending on the distance to be traveled, the transport of ceramic tiles may emit nitride and oxide hazardous gases as well as other pollutants. These toxic gases are a key contributor to environmental degradation. Ceramic tiles can also take thousands of years to degrade in a landfill, leading to environmental pollution. A preferable way is to recycle ceramic tiles instead of dumping them. Recycling ceramic tiles reduce the need for fresh raw materials, lowering their environmental impact. Lifecycle Analysis and the Ceramic Tiles Industry The latest research published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology has presented a thorough lifecycle analysis of the ceramic tile industry. The researchers have proposed that determining the functional units, system boundaries, and climate impact allocations are essential steps. A functional unit identifies the amount of a product or product system based on the performance it provides in its final application. The researchers have found that in life cycle assessments (LCA), system boundaries must be described in several dimensions, including those between the technical system and environment, the geographical region and timeframe, etc. Concentrating on ceramic tiles, life cycle assessment breaks down the whole transportation, production, and disposal system into unit operations and evaluates all of its elements, subsystems, and materials. Inventory analysis, which records the inputs and outputs of ceramic tiles, is the most essential evaluation in this phase of the ceramic tile lifecycle. The most popular software applications utilized for life cycle analysis include Open LCA, SimaPro, Umberto NxT, GaBi, QuantisSuite, and Model Bousted. As per the researchers, the LCA of ceramic tiles has indicated that excessive power consumption, industry emissions (particulate matter, gases, and toxic liquids), and waste generation are the most significant hazards. The determination of the impacts of ceramic tile products throughout their life cycle is done by utilizing a systematic approach with environmental product declarations (EPDs). These statements improve environmental performance and aid in evaluating the life cycles of products. With EPDs, businesses compete to create more sustainable products. To summarize, the researchers have stressed the need for more research and data which would boost the sustainable production of ceramic tiles, leading to a reduction in hazardous emissions. Case Study: Life Cycle Analysis of Glazed Ceramic Tile A study published in Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy focuses on the lifecycle analysis of glazed ceramic tiles to measure the environmental impacts. Total Abiotic depletion potential (ADP) components in the manufacturing of glazed ceramic tiles were about 55 mg Sb\/m2. The estimated global warming potential (GWP) for ceramic tile was 14.4 kg CO 2 equivalent per square meter. CO 2 emissions account for approximately 92.1% of the overall effect. The manufacturing of ceramic tiles had an ozone layer depletion potential of 1.3 mg CFC-11 equivalents per square meter, which was mostly driven by the production phase (52.9%). The primary contributions to this impact are emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) to the atmosphere, such as halon 1301 (55.6 %) and halon 1201 (24.3 %), caused by the use of natural gas for heat generation. The plant consumed 1,130 TJ of energy annually to create 106,195 tons of glazed ceramic tile. Future Trends As environmental awareness increases, there is a greater demand for eco-friendly building materials. The ceramic tile industry is exploring ways to reduce its environmental impact. Biogas or renewable energy might lessen the environmental impact of producing fossil fuels. Installing a combined cycle system or utilizing waste heat in the manufacturing process is also a good step. Alternative materials or waste from other industries may be substituted for standard raw materials in formulations to lessen the environmental impacts of the raw materials supply. In conclusion, a thorough lifecycle analysis of ceramic tiles reveals that their production and use have significant environmental impacts, and steps must be taken for sustainable ceramic tile production.

The new TTP Campus is located just outside of the Melbourn Science Park and will be immediately noticeable to those entering from the science park\u2019s main entrance. TTP is a world-leading technology consultancy where scientists and engineers collaborate to invent, design and develop new products and technologies. From healthcare to telecoms to clean technology and consumer products, TTP develops breakthrough solutions and invests time into creating technologies that make a genuine impact and change the world for the better. 30 years of innovation and invention have been delivered from the company\u2019s facilities at Melbourn Science Park, where for over three decades it has built strong relationships with the local community. As TTP has grown, it\u2019s created a number of spin-out companies, most of which have also chosen Melbourn Science Park as their base. Specifically designed for collaboration, the new TTP Campus delivers a working environment which inspires interaction and creativity and enables closer partnership with clients. \"Investing in new technology and product development is integral to what we do at TTP. Our new campus will enable our technically brilliant people to come together and work across disciplines in a collaborative and creative environment. This will have a truly positive impact on how we support our clients in the most innovative and progressive way.\" Says Dr Sam Hyde, Managing Director at TTP Across the campus, the new buildings house state-of-the-art labs, offices, and manufacturing space, but key to the design are a variety of indoor and outdoor workspaces and working locations to stimulate TTP\u2019s people to think differently. The mixed office and open lab space of The Hive covers nearly 80,000 ft2, it\u2019s been designed on one level and is open plan to be fully inclusive. The Tech Barn offers over 18,000 square feet of focused laboratory, testing, and build space for multiple projects. The Exchange provides a staff restaurant, and gym, as well as collaboration, agile working, and social space. These are all connected to the external landscape and fitness trail. The campus has been built to last, providing a flexible and adaptable long-term home for TTP, as well as creating a sustainable and ecologically friendly environment. With fresh water, wildflower meadows and mature planting the hope is for some local residents of the four-legged and winged variety to also move in! The campus has sustainability at the heart of its design and is also low energy with minimal need for heating and cooling, and around 30% of the energy for the site coming from solar panels.","filter_flag":1}

The product, which is aimed at domestic charging without driveways, solves the problem of how to charge an EV and could save users up to \u00a31,439 a year compared to solely using fast public chargers \u2013 at present prices. The Kerbo Charge channel differs from other \u2018cable channel\u2019 products in three key ways, the company claim: The polymer channel includes a self-closing lid that snaps down shut as the cable is inserted and removed \u2013 eliminating the trip hazard. It\u2019s been built to contour with the surface of the pavement so will sit flush. Its shallow form factor allows for fast installation by council engineers. There is a need for such products since 40% of the UK population do not have access to a driveway \u2013 meaning a current reliance on the public charging network. Milton Keynes is the first city to receive public installations of the new product with additional local authority partnerships planned for the rest of the UK, the firm said. Kerbo Charge co-founder Michael Goulden said: \u201cWe developed this product in partnership with local authorities \u2013 the critical design requirements are the ability to flex with uneven pavement surfaces, be easy to install and to be safe for all foot traffic. We also offer cashback incentives for customers who share their charge point with other members of their community.\u201d Milton Keynes City Council Cabinet Member for Climate Action and Sustainability, Cllr Jennifer Wilson-Marklew, said: \u201cThis is a really innovative and exciting trial which could encourage people to make the switch to electric. We\u2019re constantly looking for ways to both improve charging facilities and to give people the confidence that they will be able to charge their cars.\u201d Share this: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email ","filter_flag":1}

Her broad experience as a cardiologist has enabled her to see first-hand the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) on global health especially in sub Saharan Africa. It has therefore been her mandate to drive preventive cardiology as a first line response to this burden. She is also a business leader, motivated by her desire to facilitate the rise of preventive cardiology in sub-Saharan Africa. She was the pioneer cardiologist for the first Tele-Electrocardiogram project in West Africa. She is also one of the co-founders of Naveen Healthcare, a fast-growing healthcare company which, through their medical collaboration service projects, enable hospitals to improve their workflow solutions to improve staff and equipment utilisation, increase productivity, quality of healthcare delivery and revenue.

She makes health information easy to understand and teaches strategies so individuals can manage their risk factors and live a healthy life contributing to good health and well-being. CVDs are notorious for affecting professionals as a result of lifestyle and physical inactivity. Monisola therefore utilises her skills as a speaker and health workshop facilitator and cardiologist, to help professionals build physical resilience and make the right lifestyle choices. She strongly believes that mortality from cardiovascular disease can be reduced with screening, early detection as well as appropriate lifestyle and behavioural changes. That is why they collaborate with specialists to develop operational synergies in care transition and design health programs that impacts global community health practices. This is also in line with Naveen\u2019s 10,000 heart project, aimed at screening 10,000 adult Nigerians (in the first instance) for the risk factors of cardiovascular disease, to reduce morbidity and mortality, which drives the United Nations SDG goals for health which says by 2030, to reduce by a third, premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment.

For Mokutima, there are three key pillars that has kept P&G, and she says the first is the people, because people are the bedrock of what they do, the second is innovation because at P&G, innovation is their lifeblood, since it keeps them going as a company. The third are their citizenship programmes. On local employee inclusion, she stated that \u201cWe have moved from 60-40 split of expert and locals to 100 percent local employees, and a 50-50 split at the managerial level.\u201d She said.

There is also the provision of training materials for school counselors who the girls can go to if they have questions. The third pillar she says is access, because at the end of the day, after the education, the children need to stay in school during their period days, so they give one year supply of sanitary pads to schools that P&G has the programme with every year. They do this because some girls miss school because they do not have sanitary protection. \u201cThe statistics is daunting. We do this to end period poverty. It is beyond being a CSR but should be a strategic imperative for organisations and communities, it actually develops the communities and organisation too\u201d. Mokutima stated.
