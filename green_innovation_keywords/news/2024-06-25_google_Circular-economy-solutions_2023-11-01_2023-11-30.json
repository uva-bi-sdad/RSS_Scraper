But, in Colombia, the world\u2019s third-largest producer, it has found yet another use: as a building material. Thanks to Bogot\u00e1-based construction firm Woodpecker, which turns husks left over from coffee production into building boards, nearly 70,000 people now live or study inside homes and schools made from coffee waste. Woodpecker is not alone in trying to harness the potential of by-products from one of the world\u2019s favourite drinks. As global caffeine levels go from high to stratospheric, start-ups around the world are proposing solutions for the sector\u2019s growing waste problem. Some 3bn cups of coffee are drunk around the world every day and demand is surging. Consumption has doubled since the 1990s as burgeoning middle classes in countries such as India and Indonesia have increased their intake. China had one Starbucks outlet in 1999; now it is on track to have 9,000 by 2025. This generates a lot of waste: each year, millions of tonnes of methane-generating spent coffee grounds go to landfill, along with many of the disposable cups used by coffee outlets. Further up the supply chain, the processing of coffee berries into beans creates farm waste \u2014 in the form of husks, pulp, and contaminated water. New ways of packaging coffee \u2014 such as the aluminium cartridges that have helped turn it from a commodity into a luxury product in rich countries \u2014 only create new streams of waste. Sales of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Nespresso pods were boosted by the Covid-19 pandemic but, while the company encourages recycling, it also says that this happens to only about a third of the pods it produces. This year, Nespresso rolled out compostable pods in France and Switzerland, although Guillaume Le Cunff, the coffee-maker\u2019s chief executive, insists that both the aluminium and biodegradable versions are \u201cabsolutely sustainable\u201d. \u201cThe more choice we bring, the more chance we have to embrace circularity,\u201d he says, adding that other methods of making coffee, such as in cafeti\u00e8res, often use water and ground beans less precisely than pod machines, leading to greater carbon emissions \u2014 a point supported by a recent study. Ready for recycling? New ways of consuming coffee create new streams of waste \u00a9 Getty Images Le Cunff is not alone in emphasising circularity. The climate and biodiversity crises \u2014 and the associated pressure from investors to meet more stringent environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria \u2014 are pushing industries worldwide to explore circular economy principles, which aim to eliminate waste from economic systems. In September, the International Coffee Organization, a trade body, announced the creation of a Center for Circular Economy in Coffee. Based in Turin, its goal is \u201caccelerating the circular transition in the coffee supply chain\u201d. Vanu\u0301sia Nogueira, the ICO\u2019s executive director, says that \u201cfostering circular economy solutions will help . . . [transform] waste into new job and income opportunities\u201d. In Woodpecker\u2019s case, the opportunity is to make a lightweight, easily transportable material that can be used for construction in remote areas of Colombia \u2014 meeting demand for social housing. After experimenting with different types of natural fibre, it settled on a composite of coffee husks \u2014 of which there is a plentiful supply in Colombia \u2014 and plastic, as these offer the qualities it seeks. \u201cCoffee husks give you the strength . . . while the plastic gives you the durability,\u201d explains chief executive Alejandro Franco. The firm\u2019s colourful houses are certified as earthquake safe, he adds. \u201cThe lighter the construction, the more it dances with an earthquake.\u201d Other companies are starting from the opposite end of the coffee life cycle: with spent grounds. In Germany\u2019s capital, Berlin, for example, Kaffeeform is taking an elegantly circular approach, turning coffee grounds into reusable cups. According to chief executive and founder Julian Nachtigall-Lechner, caf\u00e9s \u2014 which would normally pay a fee to dispose of their grounds \u2014 are happy to hand them over instead to Kaffeeform\u2019s fleet of cyclists, who bring them to a processing hub in the middle of the city. Only 10 per cent of the $200bn generated annually by the coffee industry stays in producing countries There, they are turned into new products \u2014 including cups that end up back in the very caf\u00e9s that supplied the raw materials. It is a \u201cgood story\u201d for Berlin\u2019s hipster coffee shops to tell their customers, says Nachtigall-Lechner. The coffee industry\u2019s sustainability challenges extend beyond waste, however. Coffee consumption is expected to double by 2050, with growth particularly strong in Asia and Africa. But rising temperatures are slashing yields and threatening to render up to half of the world\u2019s current coffee farmland unusable. Growers, many of whom are in poor countries, are struggling to make a living. Only 10 per cent of the $200bn generated annually by the industry stays in producing countries. At the same time, coffee production is driving deforestation. It is one of the commodities targeted by new EU rules banning the import of products linked to deforestation from the end of next year. All of this casts doubt on whether the sector can meet increasing demand. Cole Shephard, founder of US-based start-up the Green Coffee Company, says the current supply chain model must be overhauled to create a system that is sustainable and profitable. While most producers source from a patchwork of smallholders via middlemen, Green Coffee, which operates in Colombia, controls the whole supply chain, allowing it to pay growers more and to embrace a circular economy model that, it says, generates bigger profits. The firm, which closed a $25mn series C equity fundraising round in June, is developing ways to turn pulp from coffee processing into a range of products, including fertiliser and flour. It will also ferment the pulp to produce ethanol. Most coffee is grown by farmers who have less than one hectare, so trying to amass pulp from them would be a long and cumbersome process \u2014 not what is needed for ethanol production at scale. So Green Coffee, which describes itself as Colombia\u2019s largest producer, now owns around 4,000 hectares and has nearly 14mn trees, enabling it to centralise this process. The start-up has poured $8mn into building a distillery, which will deliver a return on investment of 18 months, says chief executive Boris W\u00fcllner. Once it is up and running, the firm will produce 12,000 litres of pure ethanol a day, he says. Green Coffee is always trying to see \u201chow we can take the garbage from the farm\u201d and use it to \u201cmake a profit\u201d to give back to investors, says W\u00fcllner. \u201cThat\u2019s our circular economy approach.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
