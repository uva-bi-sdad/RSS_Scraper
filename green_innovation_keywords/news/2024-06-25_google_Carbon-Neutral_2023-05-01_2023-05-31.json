One day a student hurried into the large lecture hall and dropped the empty can for his morning caffeinated sugar buzz into the trash. Dr. Miller began that day's lecture by asking the student: \"Do you know how many joules it takes to extract the aluminum from bauxite ore for one soda can?\" He answered his own question, then extrapolated the number of aluminum cans manufactured, filled, distributed, and recycled per year in the United States, and compared the energy needed for bauxite ore versus recycled aluminum. These and similar lectures about the use of hair dryers, running tap water while brushing your teeth, and many more, instilled in me a sense of responsibility to our planet, and a desire to understand the connections and consequences between our actions and the ecosystems we live in. At the same time, I love cars, especially performance cars that are fun to drive. There's also the important role personal mobility serves in economies around the world, and our daily lives. It's the combination of these seemingly disparate values that attracted me to Honda from a young age and has fueled my career here for the last two and a half decades. Honda recently took three big steps within a single week in North America that illustrate our commitment to achieving our global goal of carbon neutrality \u2013 net zero emissions \u2013 for all products and corporate activities by 2050: We broke ground for our new joint venture EV battery plant in Ohio with LG Energy Solution. The batteries from this plant will power future EVs we make in North America. We announced a basic agreement with U.S.-based Ascend Elements, Inc., to collaborate toward our goal of achieving a stable supply of recycled lithium-ion battery materials necessary for our future EVs in North America. And we began demonstration operation of a stationary fuel cell power station at our headquarters in California that provides zero emission backup power. The Limitless Potential of Zero Today our industry is focused on electrification, and Honda has announced our clear vision to have 100% of new Honda and Acura vehicle sales to be battery-electric or fuel cell electric by 2040. The EV Hub we're establishing in Ohio will lead the way to our electrified future. However, to achieve carbon neutrality as a company will take more than electrifying our products. We will deliver our carbon neutral commitment through our Triple Action to Zero approach. Every End Creates a New Beginning Our Triple Action to Zero approach is critical to our effort to have zero environmental impact. The concept is simple: by using clean energy, along with reusing and recycling all of the materials in a product we make, we will no longer have to dig holes in the ground for finite materials and energy sources or bury spent materials in a hole in the ground at the end of their usable life. That doesn't change the values that go into our products \u2013 clean, safe, and fun vehicles that are high quality and of good value. We create vehicles for our customers to enjoy and to find new value in them for as long as possible. Even after a vehicle is purchased, by Honda and our dealers maintaining a relationship with successive customers and the vehicle, we aim to reclaim the product at end of life. This will enable us to recycle or reuse every bit of the materials from our vehicles, reprocess them back to raw materials and reuse those materials in the creation of new products. In short, to make a new Honda vehicle out of old Honda vehicles. Collaborating with Ascend Elements, POSCO, and other resource recycling businesses is one way we intend to reuse finite materials, toward achieving a consistent supply of recycled nickel, cobalt, and lithium to utilize in our EV battery supply chain from and for vehicles we will make in North America. When we have enough BEVs in circulation, we should be able to create such a closed-loop recycling system. New Applications for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology Our plans don't focus only on our mobility products. We also strive to realize zero environmental impact for all of our corporate activities. For that, we believe in using the right energy, in the right place, for the right purpose. Our new stationary fuel cell power station is a great example of this approach. Honda has been a leader in research and development of hydrogen technologies and fuel cell vehicles for more than 30 years. That gives us a lot of know-how we can apply in new zero emission applications and we are collaborating with others to create new energy solutions to maximize the benefit for society. We just announced the next-gen fuel cell system, co-developed with GM to be manufactured in Michigan, that we will apply to the Honda CR-V FCEV next year. Our goal is to use this technology to help facilitate the decarbonization of society through the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen has unique characteristics compared to energy stored in batteries. It has higher energy density, and refueling is faster than recharging. That makes it more suitable than batteries for large mobility vehicles like commercial trucks and in power sources for large infrastructure. That's why our new zero emission stationary fuel cell power station is such a significant development. Data centers require high-quality and reliable power, where any disruption can lead to downtime or problems such as data corruption and damage to servers. Typical stationary backup generators use diesel fuel, resulting in higher carbon emissions and local air pollutants. Utilizing hydrogen fuel cells offers a promising future for clean, reliable and high-quality electricity, especially when operating on \"green hydrogen,\" produced using renewable resources. Our first fuel cell power station is a proof of concept using recycled fuel cell stacks from previously leased Honda Clarity Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. By connecting multiple fuel cell systems, our demonstration stationary fuel cell unit has a capacity of about 500 kW. But as we expand this concept toward commercialization, we will utilize our next-gen fuel cell system, with plans to apply it to Honda production facilities and data centers in North America. I now find myself in a role at the intersection of our past and our future: Sustainability, building on what we know to create a new future, and developing new business models to enable that future. That's what is so exciting about the combination of announcements we've made in recent weeks. By increasing the use of renewable energy and establishing the ability to make a new Honda out of old Hondas, we are taking tangible steps toward achieving our Triple Action to Zero and our challenging global goal to achieve net zero emissions. That will benefit everyone. Jay Joseph Vice President Sustainability & Business Development American Honda Motor Co., Inc.","filter_flag":1}

TW Special Report In an era of increasing concern about climate change and its impact on the planet, industries, governments and academia are coming together to find sustainable textile solutions that minimize environmental impacts. The textile industry is making significant strides in developing sustain-able fibers and reducing its carbon footprint. In exploring the latest fiber developments with a focus on sustainability, the following highlights the efforts of the Teijin Group, BioFilaments Inc., Renewcell, PrimaLoft Inc., Thai Acrylic Fibre Co., the DITaF \u2013 Denkendorf Institute for Textile Chemistry and Chemical Fibres, the Lenzing Group and RadiciGroup as just a few examples of the industry\u2019s active approach to sustain-able fiber solutions. The Teijin Group The Teijin Group has made sustainability a core principle of its business activities. The company reports in recognizing the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it has set targets to achieve a 30-percent reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The company also aims to reduce the portion of emissions from its supply chain by 15 percent. These targets have been officially validated as science-based targets (SBTs). By aligning its goals with the Paris Agreement\u2019s objectives, Teijin is targeting a carbon-neutral future. Teijin also announced it developed a method to calculate CO2 emissions during the Tenax\u2122 carbon fiber production process. This data allowed Teijin to conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of all of its carbon fibers. The Netherlands-based Teijin Aramid, a core business of the Teijin Group, has improved the carbon foot-print of Twaron\u00ae by 28 percent com-pared to 2014 according to applicable ISO standards 14040 and 14044. Teijin Frontier, the company\u2019s fibers and product converting company, also has made significant contributions to sustainability. The company offers products such as ECOPET\u00ae, a recycled polyester fiber made from used PET bottles and fiber scraps; and SOLOTEX\u00ae, which incorporates plant-derived ingredients in its polymers. Teijin Frontier has also developed a system to calculate CO2 emissions in the polyester fiber manufacturing process, allowing for a comprehensive LCA. Nanofibrillated Cellulose Another notable development in the fiber industry is the new nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) commercial production plant opened by Vancouver, British Columbia-based Performance BioFilaments Inc. The plant, located at Resolute\u2019s Forest Products in Quebec, has a daily production capacity of 21 metric tons. NFC is a natural and renewable biomaterial derived from certified forests. According to the company, it offers a low-carbon additive that enhances the performance of advanced materials and specialty chemicals used in applications such as concrete, nonwovens and biocomposite plastics. The availability of commercial volumes of NFC opens up opportunities for various industries to adopt sustainable solutions. \u201cThe Performance BioFilaments team and development partners have dedicated years of effort to bring this low-carbon biomaterial to market,\u201d said Gurminder Minhas, managing director of Performance BioFilaments. \u201cWe have collaborated extensively across a range of industrial supply chains, integrating nanofibrillated cellulose to achieve cost, quality and dramatic performance improvements. The availability of commercial volumes means we can readily sup-port large-scale opportunities across a number of major industry sectors.\u201d Renewcell\u2019s CIRCULOSE\u00ae Stockholm-based Renewcell, a company dedicated to creating circularity in the fashion industry, has partnered with TextileGenesis\u2122 to establish full pulp-to-retail traceability for its recycled raw material CIRCULOSE\u00ae. Renewcell uses a patented process to break down and recycle cotton and other cellulosic textile waste into Circulose, a biodegradable raw material. According to the company, this material can then be used to create regenerated, man-made cellulosic fibers such as viscose, lyocell, modal or acetate. Through its collaboration with TextileGenesis, Renewcell can provide real-time digital traceability across its supply chain, ensuring transparency and authenticity for its products. This traceability is crucial for building trust and promoting sustainability in the fashion industry. \u201cOur new facility in Sundsvall, Sweden, is helping move us towards our goal of recycling the equivalent of more than 1.4 billion T-shirts per year,\u201d said Renewcell CEO Patrik Lundstrom. \u201cBut we also need a trusted and transparent supply chain to ensure the authenticity of products made from CIRCULOSE from our facilities all the way to the retail consumer. That is what TextileGenesis brings to the table.\u201d PrimaLoft Inc. Ocean Bound Latham, N.Y.-based PrimaLoft Inc. also is contributing to sustainable products with its PrimaLoft\u00ae Insulation with Ocean Bound Plastic. This insulation is made from 100-percent post-consumer recycled content, with 60 percent of the recycled mate-rial sourced from plastic bottles collected near coastlines. By preventing plastic waste from reaching the ocean and using it to create high-performance insulation, PrimaLoft is addressing the issue of plastic pollution while delivering sustainable products. The process is certified by OceanCycle, ensuring the material\u2019s ethical sourcing and traceability. \u201cThe quality of plastic quickly degrades once it\u2019s exposed to the elements in ocean water, making it unusable for most recycling efforts,\u201d said Tara Maurer-Mackay, senior vice president, Product Strategy. \u201cBy capturing plastic waste before it can reach the ocean, we\u2019re able to use the material to create products that offer our brand partners and consumers the best mix of performance and versatility with a reduced environmental impact.\u201d According to the company, PrimaLoft Insulation with Ocean Bound Plastic offers the same performance benefits for which PrimaLoft is known, including lightweight thermal performance, packability, and durability. By combining performance with sustainability, PrimaLoft is showing its commitment to its \u201cRelentlessly Responsible\u2122\u201d mission. Upgraded Regel\u2122 Fiber Bangkok-based Thai Acrylic Fibre Co. Ltd. (TAF), a part of Aditya Birla Group, recently introduced an upgraded version of Regel\u2122 fiber, incorporating 75-percent recycled content. This new variant of Regel fiber, which already contained 50-percent recycled content, now holds the distinction of being the only GRS certified acrylic fiber in the world, according to the company. Regel is manufactured using a chemical recycling process that produces a warm, comfortable fiber in vibrant shades. \u201cUsing recycled materials is a key aspect of sustainability, and products are made from recycled materials are becoming popular among consumers,\u201d said Tuhin Kulshreshtha, head of marketing, TAF. \u201c\u2026 increasing the recycled content of Regel from 50 percent to 75 percent will help meet consumers\u2019 demands and provide them with sustainable options. Additionally, [the] higher recycled content in Regel will also allow manufacturers to create sustainable blends without compromising on quality or performance.\u201d Regel with 75-percent recycled content currently is available in staple form and the company reports it plans to introduce other options such as tow and tops in the future. Yarn From Castor Oil RadiciGroup, based in Italy, has introduced Biofeel\u00ae Eleven, a naturally sourced yarn made using castor oil, as part of its commitment to technical and environmental performance. Castor oil plantations, primarily located in the Gujarat region of India, provide a source for the beans, which contain approximately 45 percent oil. This oil, rich in ricinolein, serves as the raw material for the bio-polymer polyamide 11 used for RadiciGroup\u2019s Biofeel Eleven yarn. The remaining byproduct after oil extraction is a highly effective bio-fertilizer that promotes soil health, exemplifying circularity and zero waste. \u201cBiofeel Eleven has unique and special properties, such as low water absorption, increased lightness and improved strength properties,\u201d noted Marco De Silvestri, sales and marketing head of RadiciGroup\u2019s Advanced Textile Solutions Business Area. \u201cThis means being able to produce fabrics that are both durable and comfortable to the touch and skin. This translates into a wide range of applications, from sportswear to workwear, from fashion garments to textiles for luxury cars.\u201d CELLUN For Composites The Germany-based Denkendorf Institute for Textile Chemistry and Chemical Fibres (DITF) in collaboration with project partners CG TEC, Cordenka, ElringKlinger, Fiber Engineering, and Technikum Laubholz, is developing a new fiber composite material called CELLUN. This material incorporates reinforcing fibers made of cellulose, offering a sustainable alter-native to glass or carbon fibers used in industrial molded parts production. The reinforcing component of CELLUN is a combination of non-fusible fibers and thermoplastic derivatized cellulose fibers \u2014 either regenerated fibers from Cordenka or DITF\u2019s HighPerCell\u00ae cellulose fibers\u2014 as a matrix, which is used to produce a hybrid roving. In DITF\u2019s in-house pilot plants, this roving is further processed into a hybrid roving or hybrid textile, which can be converted into a molded part using pultrusion and thermoforming processes or injection molding. The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK) has partnered with DITF and is funding a project to develop CELLUN to industry maturity. The project will also look at the possibility to fully recycle CELLUN materials at the end of a product\u2019s life. Two approaches are being researched: thermally reshaping CELLUN molded parts without any quality loss and chemically separating the CELLUN material into its individual components for 100 percent reuse as new starting materials. The development of CELLUN materials offers a sustainable, resource-conserving, and cost-effective alternative to established composites in the lightweight construction and automotive sectors. Carbon-Neutral VEOCEL\u2122 Viscose Austria-based Lenzing Group has announced the expansion of its sustainable viscose fiber portfolio with the launch of carbon-neutral VEOCEL\u2122 branded viscose fibers for Europe and the United States. In Asia, Lenzing plans to convert its existing production capacity for conventional viscose into capacity for responsible specialty fibers in the second half of the year. This expan-sion reflects VEOCEL\u2019s commitment to providing nonwovens value chain partners and brands with environmentally friendly options that contribute to reducing carbon footprints. \u201cEverything we do is centered around VEOCEL\u2019s mission to be a responsible everyday care brand and demonstrate our care for the future of our planet,\u201d said Monique Buch, vice president, Global Nonwovens Business, Lenzing. \u201cWe believe it is imperative for us to not only reduce our own carbon emissions, but also to empower our partners to reduce their carbon footprint.\u201d The carbon-neutral VEOCEL viscose fibers are made from sustainably and responsibly managed wood and pulp sources, adhering to the stringent guidelines of the Lenzing Wood and Pulp Policy and trusted forest certification systems. Lenzing\u2019s production plant in Austria employs efficient production methods, such as direct production from wood to fiber and the use of renewable energy sources like solar power and biomass, to reduce carbon emissions. To offer carbon-neutral products, Lenzing measured, reduced, and offset any remaining emissions through financing climate projects. Lenzing partnered with Climate-Partner, a provider of corporate climate action solutions, to develop carbon-neutral VEOCEL viscose fibers. The company has also collaborated with Helsinki-based Suominen to produce the first carbon-neutral nonwoven, BIOLACE\u00ae Zero, utilizing VEOCEL lyocell fibers. Nonwoven roll-goods made with VEOCEL viscose fibers are available for Suominen\u2019s clients, demonstrating the importance of collaboration in promoting sustainable product development within the nonwoven market. Fiber Sustainability Focus The fiber industry is investing in developments with a strong focus on sustainability. Companies like the those mentioned above, as well as many more, are laser-focused on these efforts, driving innovation and creating solutions that minimize environmental impact. Through initiatives such as reducing CO2 emissions, implementing life cycle assessments, promoting circularity, and using recycled materials, fiber companies are leaning towards a more sustainable future.

Under U.S. President Joe Biden, the United States became one of 150 countries to have signed the Global Methane Pledge, which means the administration agreed to be a part of a global effort to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Since methane has a large, but short-term effect on global warming, reducing methane emissions can substantially reduce warming in the coming decades. One priority is reducing emissions from enteric fermentation, part of the digestive process of cattle, sheep, and other ruminants. In the United States, enteric fermentation has accounted for about 25% of all methane emissions over the last ten years. And, with rising global demand for beef\u2014driven largely by population growth and increasing wealth\u2014enteric methane emissions are projected to rise by more than 45% between 2020 and 2050. Companies throughout the livestock supply chain\u2014dairy suppliers like Danone, supermarkets, fast food chains, and others\u2014are now increasingly seeking to cut their methane footprint. Minimizing Peak Warming Requires Methane Reducing Research Today Figure Adapted from Spark Climate Solutions Yet as management guru Peter Drucker famously said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it.\u201d Such is the case with enteric methane. The technology to accurately estimate emissions at scale\u2014across a dairy or beef company\u2019s supply chain, for instance\u2014generally does not yet exist. In 2020, Burger King notably had to walk back its claims of producing low-methane beef when scientists pointed to the lack of supporting evidence. Since then, other companies such as TruBeef and Silver Fern Farms have claimed to produce carbon-neutral beef. But many researchers and industry actors agree that a lack of verifiable on-farm emissions data undermines such claims, complicates supply chain carbon accounting, and generally obstructs mitigation efforts. To better assess progress toward methane mitigation targets\u2014let alone achieve them\u2014researchers must accomplish at least three things. First, they must make measurement of livestock emissions more accurate, consistent, and affordable. This is critical for assessing the effectiveness of changes in livestock management in reducing emissions, and for estimating emissions embodied in supply chains or particular products. Second, researchers must use measurement data to develop predictive models (for example, carbon footprint calculators) of different practices before those practices are implemented and to inexpensively estimate emissions without on-farm measurement. Third, scientists must measure and test methane reduction strategies in a greater range of environments than has been done thus far, particularly with animals while they\u2019re grazing, which is when they appear to emit the most enteric methane. Governments and the private sector can each contribute to these goals by investing in enteric methane research. Make enteric methane measurement and modeling affordable and accurate Presently, there are several approaches to directly measure enteric methane emissions: respiratory chambers, the SF6 tracer technique, GreenFeed systems, and micrometeorological measurements. Respiratory chambers are generally considered the gold standard for directly measuring individual animal emissions. These are built as enclosures for animals where air at the inlet and outlet is measured for methane and other greenhouse gases. While highly accurate, chambers cannot be used to assess emissions from grazing animals, especially under normal behavior. That requires attaching canisters to animals to capture their respiration and belches, and using the SF6 tracer technique to estimate emissions. Another, newer approach is to use a GreenFeed System, which directly measures snapshots (3-6 minutes) of enteric methane production in the breath of ruminants in pastures or feedlots while they are eating. These measurements are then used to estimate daily emissions. A fourth approach, applicable when animals are grazing, uses ~10m tall towers with tubing that draws air into methane sensors as air circulates in the atmosphere. These tower-based approaches are referred to as micrometeorological measurement techniques. Given their setup, micrometeorological towers measure the net amount of methane emitted from an area of land, capturing not only enteric emissions but also emissions from manure and soils\u2014measuring the whole system. Some such approaches have benefits for individual animal feeding trials of feed additives, yet none are easily deployable on farms\u2014for now\u2014a missing step for accurate supply chain carbon accounting. Greenfeed image, Jennifer Michal from Dr. Kristen Johnson Lab Several indirect measurement methods also help reduce the cost of estimating emissions. In vitro flow systems mimic what happens in an animal\u2019s rumen, the part of the stomach where bacteria turn food into methane and other compounds. They are a lab-based approach to measuring the effect of different feeds, drugs, and other products on methane emissions. They are important for screening new products at a low cost to help determine whether a more expensive animal feeding trial is warranted. Researchers are also developing methods to use proxies, such as blood samples, to estimate emissions. Increasingly airborne measurements\u2014like drones\u2014are also being used to estimate methane emissions over large areas, although are not yet commercially available. In addition, high resolution satellite-based measurements are expected to come online soon. These higher resolution satellites should be able to quantify emissions from some large concentrated animal sources like commercial dairies. However, there are at least two big shortcomings with measurement today. First, there are not enough universities and other institutions with measurement equipment to meet demand. Only a handful of land-grant universities have access to the gold standard in methane emissions measurement technology for individual animals: respiratory chambers. Likewise, according to conversations with experts in the industry, only 18 colleges or universities across the US have the newer \u2018snapshot\u2019 measurement system, the GreenFeed System. Within USDA\u2019s internal research arm, the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), only six stations have GreenFeed Systems. Fewer still have the ability to compare GreenFeed and respiratory chamber methods against each other when studying diets and feed additives\u2014a recognized standard operating procedure. Meanwhile, demand for testing of methane-reducing products is growing. This mismatch between supply and demand for methane measurement poses a large bottleneck in advancing knowledge and commercialization of potential enteric methane mitigation options. Second, existing measurement technologies are too expensive, labor intensive, and\/or technical for livestock producers to purchase and operate. They are typically only used in research settings. While the GreenFeed system is perhaps the easiest method for commercial producers to use, it is still cost-prohibitive outside of research institutions (~$90,000 for the device with another ~$10,000 annually for data acquisition) and requires at least several days of work to train cattle to use the system. Additionally, the most common land measurement approaches require extensive technical knowledge to calibrate and maintain sensors or to run gas chromatographs. Aerial and satellite-based measurement can address some of these issues, but is also highly expensive, unable to measure methane from individual animals or groups, and currently not precise enough to measure emissions from most animal agriculture operations such as pastures. Overcoming these two limitations\u2014institutional and technological\u2014would enable greater progress in several types of enteric methane research. First, universities and companies would be able to produce a sufficient number of studies and replications to improve the certainty of efficacy claims about the methane reduction potential of feed additives in the near term. Second, it would facilitate trials that can assess long-term efficacy and animal safety. Third, it would accelerate efforts to breed low-methane cattle, whether using conventional or novel techniques such as gene editing. Greater measurement would also enable development of more accurate predictive models. Since direct measurement will always carry a cost, at least some livestock producers and other companies in the supply chain will likely need to rely on models (for example, carbon footprint calculators) to estimate emissions. Investments in developing and refining both bottom-up diet-based methane predictive models and top-down climate models may be as important to mitigation as investment in better measurement technologies. Ideally, these models could be used to accurately estimate emissions under a wide range of scenarios, such as when producers adopt a new feed additive. Predictive models do exist, but they haven\u2019t been designed to assess the impact of many interventions to reduce emissions. To build these models, researchers must first gather emissions data from a variety of diets, breeds, and management conditions. The more robust those data are, the more reliable the model will become. Eventually, models will eliminate the need for every animal to be sampled. Conduct more regionally specific field trials To understand the efficacy of different livestock management practices in reducing methane emissions, researchers need to conduct trials in diverse locations and across operation types. Studies have shown that the feed additive 3-NOP can decrease methane production between 30% and 70%. However, the efficacy depends on diet, among other factors. In particular, 3-NOP\u2019s efficacy diminishes as the amount of cellulose in the diet increases. This is problematic given that ~77% of methane emissions from beef production result from cattle grazing on cellulosic material in pastures. The few global scholars doing this work also recognize that more animal feeding trials are needed to determine methane reductions from feeding Asparagopsis taxiformis\u2014or red algae. Supplementing ruminants\u2019 diets with A. taxiformis resulted in 9\u201398% reduction in methane production across studies. Such a range complicates efficacy claims\u2014it must be narrowed through more research. And, much like 3-NOP, some research suggests supplementation is more effective in high-starch diets (for example, at feedlots) compared to high-forage diets (for example, range and pasture). Precise estimates of efficacy therefore require running trials with different types of feed and in different types of rangeland and pasture. Additionally, pre-existing microbial communities in the rumen are very resilient. A single dosing of either 3-NOP or A. taxiformis can reduce enteric methane briefly, but emissions return when it is no longer actively being fed. Thus, current delivery methods of feed additives incorporated into the daily diets of conventionally managed dairy cows and feedlot finished beef cattle work well. However, more appropriate and adaptable delivery methods need to be developed and tested if these products are to be incorporated in less intensively managed grazing production systems across the country. Federal research can drive enteric methane innovation Accurate enteric methane emissions data are at the core of reducing methane emissions from global livestock, and substantially reducing warming in the coming decades. Federal, state, and other governments can improve measurement and data collection by funding enteric methane research and data collection. Data, in turn, can be used to inform decisions about what actions to take to address climate change, for example, which diets and management practices to support. The scientific community estimates that adequately addressing the research needs for methane-reducing feed additives alone will require a $100 million investment in multi-year trials. Congress, USDA, and other policymakers have several tools at their disposal to advance measurement, modeling, and ultimately mitigation of enteric methane emissions. These options include intramural research, extramural research, and public-private partnerships. USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) conducts intramural research, including on livestock sustainability, at its sites around the country. Some notable sites that have done work on carbon and nitrogen cycling in livestock include the ones in Kimberly, ID and Bushland, TX. Investment in updating ARS facilities will allow for regionally specific diets and breeds to be accounted for in data collection. More ARS sites should be equipped with state-of-the-art methane measurement instruments to ensure standardization in data collection and output. ARS sites are well-suited to quickly address many research gaps since they often have low barriers to launch new projects compared to universities. Structure of U.S. Public Agricultural R&D \"From Lab to Farm,\" Breakthrough Institute USDA also hosts the flagship extramural research funding initiative, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which can and does fund enteric research. For example, within the Foundational and Applied Sciences request for application, enteric methane is highlighted as important in the Animal Nutrition, Growth, and Lactation program area. Additionally, at least five other program areas in that request solicit proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Recently, AFRI devoted up to $5 million in funding under its Sustainable Agriculture Systems program to enteric methane research, as part of a broader international effort to accelerate enteric innovation. These funding opportunities are steps in the right direction. Still, between 2017 and 2021, projects to understand, measure, and reduce enteric methane emissions accounted for less than 2% of non-ARS funding for agricultural climate mitigation. Thus, despite the potential opportunities to fund enteric methane research through extramural grants, barriers to advancements exist, one of which may be the highly competitive nature of these grant programs. About 70% of AFRI proposals that are deemed worthy by expert review panels are not funded. Other funding mechanisms exist. Through a Congressional mandate, Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) is funded to deliver public-private partnership-type research grants. The Greener Cattle Initiative, housed within FFAR, is an industry-oriented research consortium that will award approximately $5 million over the next five years to support research to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle. Together with the new sustainable agriculture systems request, these efforts will distribute $10 million over the next five years. While the $10 million directed toward enteric methane research is certainly needed, it comes far short of the $100 million needed to adequately address the issue. Meeting the scientific capacity is also contingent upon continued expertise. Unfortunately, methane-related livestock expertise dwindles with increased retirements. To reduce any gaps in knowledge, the next generation of scientists need funding to be trained under current experts. One avenue to address the shrinking pool of methane-related talent is the AFRI Education and Workforce Development program which funds research experiences for undergraduates, predoctoral fellowships, and postdoctoral fellowships. Additionally, FFAR provides scholarships to help veterinary students perform research in areas like climate change. Scientific and Human Capacity Needs for Addressing Enteric Methane Breakthrough Institute Ultimately, enteric methane research and innovation is an important part of minimizing emissions and peak warming. While some federal programs and grants do fund relevant research, the amount of funding is far below what researchers say is needed. Recognizing the gaps in methane emissions measurement and research capacity, researchers, industry, and companies must work collaboratively to build scientific expertise, improve measurement technology, develop mitigation options, create robust models, and increase adoption of emerging technologies. Only then can farmers, processors, retailers, and others throughout the supply chain account for and verify emissions, and work effectively to rapidly reduce their carbon footprint.

The problem is not just that too few companies are leveraging these tools, it is also that they have made no clear sustainability commitments and have no defined targets or plan of action. Only 57% of industrial companies have carbon-neutral targets and, of these, nearly half are yet to fully deploy their sustainability initiatives [3].

The sheer scale of the apparel industry means it has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, working conditions, water quality, and resource consumption. But in recent years, numerous clothing companies have been sprouting up or shifting practices to embrace sustainability. We reviewed many clothing companies to identify those using recycled materials, eliminating the use of toxic chemicals from their supply chains, minimizing packaging, and paying employees a living wage. Many companies are relatively young and were started with a vision of helping the world. Others have been in business for decades and are embracing greener practices. Shopping is a personal experience, and every choice you make will have an environmental impact. We urge you to learn about the certifications and brands below to make informed, responsible, and fashionable choices. Third-Party Certifications, Ratings, & Initiatives During our reviews of the clothing brands, we relied on the most reliable environmental and responsible business labeling and certification programs to identify the best options. Look for these labels to help distinguish companies that are leaders in adopting green, socially responsible, and humane practices. B Corp Certified To qualify for B Corp certifications, candidates must take the B Impact Assessment, which evaluates its impact on workers, customers, suppliers, the community, and the environment. To qualify, organizations must achieve a minimum verified score of at least 80 out of 200. The average score of an ordinary business that completes the B Impact Assessment is 50.9. Bluesign Certified Materials The Bluesign certification ensures textiles are tested for harmful substances and certifies high product safety in the apparel and footwear industry. Bluesign guarantees that certified products are not harmful to human health. Climate Neutral Certified This is a globally-recognized certification for climate accountability that entails measuring the organization\u2019s carbon footprint and offsetting emissions. Participants must document carbon emissions reduction plans and progress annually. Fair Labor Association Accreditation Companies accredited by FLA meet international standards for labor rights by implementing a systems-level approach to human rights compliance and social responsibility. Fair Labor Accredited companies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and must demonstrate continuous improvement efforts to address working conditions and protect workers\u2019 rights. Responsible Down Certified The Responsible Down Standard (RDS) ensures that geese and ducks are raised in compliance with animal welfare standards. It certifies products containing feathers and down from certified farms. Responsible Packaging Movement prAna created the Responsible Packaging Movement (RPM) to encourage like-minded companies to use sustainable packaging. Member brands set responsible packaging goals and collaborate and share sustainable packaging concepts with one another. Climate Action Corps This initiative by the Outdoor Industries Association (OIA) fosters collaboration in the outdoor industry to lead on climate action. Companies that join commit to measuring and reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and sharing their progress annually. Textile Exchange Recycled Polyester Challenge The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action and Textile Exchange partnered up to challenge to accelerate the use of recycled polyester. The 2025 Recycled Polyester Challenge calls on businesses to commit to sourcing from 45% to 100% of polyester from recycled sources by 2025. Sustainable Clothing Brands When we used the labels above and dug into their business practices, 18 clothing companies made the cut. They represent the best-in-class fashion brands and we recommend them as a starting point in your conscious shopping. While no company is perfect, they make efforts to reduce emissions, water use, waste in their manufacturing and distribution systems, and treat the people who make the materials and clothing fairly. We sampled women\u2019s joggers, hiking pants, dresses, sunhats, sleepwear, bikinis, rain gear, and jackets from some of the leaders in sustainable clothing to give you the inside scoop. All of the items we sampled were for women or unisex, although many of the brands also feature men\u2019s clothing. Dive in, and find the environmentally responsible look you love. Allbirds This green footwear company also has a line of men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel, including socks, activewear, and loungewear. It has been Climate Neutral Certified since 2020, and its online product descriptions include information on the carbon footprint of products. It has set clear goals for reducing emissions, which includes greener materials sourcing and reduced supply chain energy use. Allbirds uses innovative materials in its products, such as Trino. It is made from Eucalyptus tree fibers from sustainably managed forests and ZQ Merino wool, which has high standards for animal welfare, sustainability, and social performance. TrinoXO also contains chitosan fiber, which reduces odors and is harvested from discarded snow crab shells. We sampled Allbird\u2019s R&R Sweatpants with organic pima cotton, hemp, and Tencel; Long Sleeve Sea Tea; and Trino Briefs. Arms of Andes This company has a very compact supply chain that\u2019s based exclusively in Peru, where it sources alpaca yarn and fleece and manufactures fabric and garments. This approach gives Arms of Andes a smaller carbon footprint and enables traceability. Its clothing is made of 100% alpaca wool and natural dyes, so the garments are biodegradable and soft, and it uses plastic-free packaging. Arms of Andes was founded by a Peruvian-American bother-sister duo that works with family-run Peruvian alpaca farmers with small, free-roaming herds. Alpacas have been domesticated in the Andes Mountains of South America since pre-Inca times. There is a way of life surrounding breeding and herding alpacas that continues in some highland communities to this day. Alpaca fibers are durable, breathable, and moisture-wicking, which helps with thermo-regulation. We sampled the Women\u2019s Alpaca V-neck shirt, a soft and breathable base layer for hikes and other physical activities. Athleta Based in San Francisco, California, this women\u2019s activewear manufacturer and retailer has realized some impressive sustainability achievements since it was founded in 1998. To date, it has repurposed 441 million plastic bottles into recycled materials, and it has partnered with TENCEL to source modal made from responsibly managed European forests. In 2019, it announced that 60% of its materials are from sustainable fibers, including recycled polyester and nylon, TENCEL\u00ae Modal, TENCEL\u00ae Lyocell, and organic cotton. It also joined the Textile Exchange Recycled Polyester Challenge and agreed to use 45% recycled polyester by 2025 and 90% by 2030. Athleta operates over 200 retail locations across North America, which are all powered by renewable electricity offsets. It has been part of the GAP portfolio of companies since 2008, along with Banana Republic and Old Navy, and four of its factories are Fair Trade Certified. However, it would be helpful to know more about the working conditions in other factories and if it plans to certify the remaining ones. We sampled the Balance Jogger, Seasoft Pants, and the Seasoft 1\/4 Zip Sweatshirt, which all contain TENCEL Modal. The fabric is super soft yet dries quickly, making it easy to line-dry to save energy. Avocado This natural and certified organic mattress, bedding, and pillow company also has a line of bath robes and pajamas. Avocado has a very impressive list of third-party certifications verifying its strong commitment to sustainability and slowing climate change. For example, it was one of the first Climate Neutral Certified companies in 2019. The following year, Avocado became carbon negative by reducing its carbon emissions and then offsetting more than its entire carbon footprint. We appreciate that Avocado uses GOTS-certified organic cotton, as cotton marketed as organic isn\u2019t always actually organic, according to the New York Times. It also uses Lenzing-certified modal in its pajamas, which ensures it is ethically and sustainably sourced. In addition, Avocado donates 1% of its revenue to environmental nonprofits. We sampled the organic terry cloth robe and the modal pajama shorts, which are both incredibly cozy. Baukjen This sustainable and ethical women\u2019s fashion company believes in balancing \u201cpurpose and profit.\u201d This certified B Corp scores especially high in the governance category, which assesses an organization\u2019s mission, engagement for social and environmental impact, transparency, and ethics. It won the 2021 UN Global Climate Action Award, which shows Baukjen\u2019s dedication to the green fashion movement. Baukjen is increasing the use of recycled fibers in its clothing and shortening its supply chain. In 2020, it became carbon-negative across its supply chain by reducing carbon emissions and then offsetting more than it generates. It also vets garment factories, and has them agree to a rigorous Code of Conduct, and performs regular visits. We sampled the Jo Top with Lenzing Ecover and the Lilith Shirt with Tencel, which use materials sourced from certified sustainably managed forests. Big Agnes Fifteen years ago, Big Agnes introduced two sleeping bags and a tent that were made from 100% recycled materials, which was radically green at that time. This outdoor gear company has made some big strides in recent years in sustainable materials, fabrics, and packaging. All its products are 100% PFAS free, and it uses Downtek\u2122, which has a PFC-Free, Bluesign\u00ae Certified water-repellant chemistry. Big Agnes is reducing water and energy consumption during the manufacturing process of its tents with the use of solution-dyed fabrics, and many of its synthetic sleeping bags have recycled insulation and linings. It is even making its TwisterCane\u2122 pad from sugarcane harvested in a carbon-negative process. Three of its U.S. facilities purchase 100% renewable electricity through offset programs, and it has joined the Outdoor Industry Association\u2019s Climate Action Corps. We tried out the Big Agnes Women\u2019s Larkspar Insulated Jacket, which features post-consumer recycled content in the shell, lining, and shell. It\u2019s lightweight, packable, and surprisingly warm without being bulky. Coalatree Coalatree launched its first clothing line in 2010 to create workwear for its organic farm in Colorado. This eco-minded apparel and gear company goes the extra mile to recycle or repurpose materials and is taking some impressive strides in producing clothing from recycled plastic bottles and coffee grounds. Coalatree has repurposed more than 83,000 cups of coffee grounds to date and uses a waterless dying system that conserves both water and energy. According to the Coalatree blog, \u201cYarn infused with coffee saves landfills from coffee waste, reduces the amount of petroleum based products in production, lowers carbon emissions and uses less energy to manufacture.\u201d Also, all the factories overseas that make its goods are Bluesign-certified. Although Coalatree is incorporating environmentally responsible practices, we\u2019d like to see more concrete sustainability commitments and third-party certifications. Coalatree produces a full line of women\u2019s and men\u2019s apparel and gear, such as 100% recycled nylon blankets. We sampled the Evolution Joggers, made with recycled coffee grounds, and the waterproof Trailhead Pants, which was made in a factory with an on-site wetland. Cotopaxi This company creates a variety of colorful outerwear and apparel for enjoying the great outdoors. Founded in 2013, its Gear for Good\u00ae promise shapes all aspects of the company and how it operates. Although this promise may sound like greenwashing, the outdoor gear company has numerous certifications and sustainability achievements that demonstrate its commitment, and it is both a B Corp and Climate Neutral certified. According to Cotopaxi, its total carbon footprint is 13,859 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent). It has been working to reduce emissions by eliminating single-use plastics from its packaging and replacing them with recycled or biodegradable alternatives. Cotopaxi has also been working with its suppliers to reduce emissions with recycled, repurposed, or third-party-certified responsible materials. In addition, Cotopaxi provides multi-year grants to nonprofits addressing extreme poverty in Latin America by investing in health, education, and livelihood. It is a member of 1% for the Planet, a network of organizations that donate at least 1% of annual revenue to address pressing environmental issues. We sampled the Cotopaxi Fuego Hooded Down Jacket, with responsibly sourced down and many colorful options. It\u2019s relatively thin yet very warm even in winter weather and has a snug-fitting scuba hood. Girlfriend Collective This company makes ethically sourced activewear for women from size XXS to 6XL and uses 100% recycled and recyclable packaging. It sources recycled fabrics that are certified Standard 100 by Oeko-Tex, so they are tested for harmful substances. \u201cDid you know almost all synthetic activewear is made from plastic? We just make ours with materials that would otherwise clog landfills and pollute the earth. It all starts with post-consumer water bottles that have their labels removed, are crushed into billions of minuscule chips, and then washed until they\u2019re sparkling clean,\u201d according to the website. The Girlfriend Collective works with recycling partners in Taiwan and sewing partners in Vietnam, where products are manufactured in factories with third-party certifications like SA 8000. Such certifications help ensure workers are paid a living wage and have safe working conditions. We sampled the Comet Reset Swing Shorts, with delightfully soft fabric, and the Moss Trail Shorts. Both are made from recycled plastic bottles. Mountain Equipment Company (MEC) This Canadian outdoor retailer was founded in 1971, initially as a coop. It produces a variety of outdoor apparel, often with recycled and Bluesign-approved materials. MEC permanently phased out the use of long-chain (C8) PFC DWR chemistry from products in 2016 and is using safer alternatives. Many of its outdoor clothing uses recycled materials, such as nylon and insulation. Many items in its lineup are also Fair Trade certified, which shows a dedication to the social impact of its products. MEC developed its first supplier code of conduct and factory audit program in the early 2000s and has standards in place for every factory that produces its products. Over the years, it has discovered and remediated issues in health and safety, excessive overtime, forced labor, and child labor. MEC has a full line of women\u2019s and men\u2019s outdoor clothing and gear, including duffle bags made of 100% recycled material and totes made with salvaged fabric. We sampled the Aquanator Rain Pants, Aquanator Long Rain Coat, and Hybrid Softshell Pants made with recycled materials. Orvis Orvis was founded in 1856 in Vermont as a company offering fly-fishing equipment. Conservation and a deep connection with the natural world are key aspects of the Orvis brand, and it has committed to protecting and restoring 50 million acres of vital habitat by 2030. It donates 5% of pre-tax profits to \u201cto protecting nature, supporting communities, and advancing canine health and well-being.\u201d The Orvis fly-fishing blog shows its dedication to education and preserving wildlife habitat. It\u2019s great to see an older company embracing sustainability and making its operations and products more sustainable over time. Numerous Orvis products contain recycled nylon and polyester and Bluesign-certified fabrics. It is a founding member of the OIA\u2019s Climate Action Corps, has a goal to be climate positive by 2030, and use exclusively plastic-free packaging. We sampled the Women\u2019s Horseshoe Hills Jacket and the Pro Insulated Hoodie, which both contain recycled materials. Passion Lilie This fair trade fashion brand is based in New Orleans and produces loungewear, dresses, jumpsuits, sarongs, outwear, and more. Passion Lilie was founded to make fair trade clothing more stylish, affordable, and well-fitting, and each item is made in small batches in India. The company purchases carbon offsets for the emissions generated from shipping goods from India to the U.S. and encourages customers to offset their shipping emissions. It uses GOTS-certified organic dyes and no toxic azo dyes. Passion Lilie\u2019s dedication to fair trade goes beyond paying a livable wage and safe working conditions. It promotes gender equity in the workplace with a free job training program for women in the apparel industry in India to help them advice to a higher-paying tailor position. The 3-month training includes a salary, a loaned sewing machine, and free space to work. We sampled the Badru Button Dress with hand-woven cotton ikat fabric. Patagonia This is one of the most impressive companies featured in this article from a sustainability standpoint, and its high B Corp score is a reflection of this. Each year, B Lab recognizes companies with the highest verified scores in five impact areas. Patagonia made the Best for the World: Community and Best for the World: Environment lists for the last two years. It has also been a certified B Corp since 2011, which shows it is a pioneer in environmentally friendly and ethical business. Patagonia has some innovative materials which help conserve resources. It uses Infinna Fiber from post-consumer recycled cotton from its take-back program, recycled spandex, and all the virgin cotton it uses is organic. Patagonia even promotes Regenerative Organic Certified cotton practices with farmers in India, and over 2,200 farmers are participating. We sampled the Nano Air Light Hybrid Hoodie, which is Fair Trade-certified sewn and contains recycled materials. prAna This brand has produced performance clothing, such as activewear and yoga accessories, since 1992. The company embarked on a journey to reduce the use of plastic waste in its packaging in 2010 and has realized many sustainability goals since. It then launched the Responsible Packaging Movement in 2020 to promote sustainable packaging practices in the consumer goods industry. To date, more than 150 like-minded brands have joined, including MEC and Smartwool and nonprofit partners 5 Gyres and Canopy, to help with education and advocacy. One way that prAna is unique from a sustainability standpoint is that it works to bring organizations together to collaborate and realize shared goals. It also works with the Fair Labor Association to promote workers\u2019 rights, and with Bluesign to minimize its chemical impact. Many of its products feature recycled cotton and nylon materials. We sampled the comfortable Hall Pant II made with 95% recycled fabric. Sensi Graves This functional swimwear brand for women has products from size XS to XXL that are designed by a professional kiteboarder.

Today, we do not limit ourselves to the sales of products like microscopes and retinal diagnostic systems. By providing solutions utilizing Nikon\u2019s core technology of precision optics and imaging\/analysis technology, we are shifting from \u201csales of things\u201d to \u201csales of solution,\u201d contributing to the improvement of people\u2019s quality of life (QOL). So what are Nikon\u2019s current efforts? And what is the Organ-on-a-Chip Imaging and Analysis contract service conducted at the Nikon BioImaging Lab, which supports drug discovery research using cells? We sat down with two employees knowledgeable of onsite operations, Kenji Miyamoto, Ph.D (Manager of Drug Discovery Research Support Department,Bioscience Sales Division, Nikon Solutions Co., Ltd.) and Kazuaki Tokunaga, Ph.D (Section Manager of East Japan Application Specialist Section, Application Engineering Department, Bioscience Sales Division, Nikon Solutions Co., Ltd.), to ask about Nikon\u2019s future vision. Going beyond offering microscopes and supporting applications \u2014Please tell us what values Nikon is providing in the healthcare field. Miyamoto: Throughout Nikon\u2019s 100-year history, we have established businesses like the Imaging Products Business, which handles cameras; the Precision Equipment Business, which handles lithography systems to manufacture semiconductors and flat panel displays; the Components Business, which handles light sources\/optical instruments, optical processing, etc.; the Industrial Metrology Business, which handles industrial measuring instruments and industrial microscopes; and the Healthcare Business, which deals with ophthalmology instruments and biological microscopes. Of these, the biological microscope possesses the longest history. Nikon has always utilized state-of-the-art optical technologies to develop high-precision observation of microscopic structures, and as a result, we have provided value by contributing to the advancement of science. However, we are now taking our efforts a step further by focusing on providing solutions through application support for customers. JOICO, the first microscope designed by Nikon (released in 1925) AX\/AX R with NSPARC Super-resolution Multiphoton Confocal Microscope \u2014I see, so this is what you were alluding to when you mentioned shifting from \u201csales of things\u201d to \u201csales of solution.\u201d What kind of solutions are you providing to solve customers\u2019 issues? Miyamoto: For example, a solution we are providing for pharmaceutical companies is the image acquiring and analysis contract services for organs-on-a-chip. Organs-on-a-chip are gaining attention as an alternative for animal testing. Nikon has collaborated with organ-on-a-chip makers to obtain knowledge on how to observe a variety of organs-on-a-chip through microscopes, aiding pharmaceutical companies looking to utilize them to study the toxicity of drugs and medicine. Another example of our solutions is in the field of regenerative medicine\u2014specifically, the proposal of cell culture observation system and image analysis software during the cell culturing process. By acquiring images of the cultured cell and analyzing them, we can assess the cell\u2019s status with numbers during the culture process, allowing for indicators and objective process management. We believe that by contributing to the achievement of efficient process management, we can reduce the workload of professionals in the field of regenerative cellular medicine. Stabilizing cell culture through objective indicators and process management \u2014How are Nikon\u2019s technologies aiding cell culture? Tokunaga: We can broadly categorize our contributions into three main areas of \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cevaluation,\u201d and \u201canalysis.\u201d The first is the area of \u201cculture.\u201d In the bioscience field, it is extremely important to culture cells suited for each experiment, as its subjects are organisms like cells and tissues. Precautions and processes for cell culture differ according to each cell type, and researchers much proceed with caution so that the cell\u2019s characteristics do not change during the experiment due to mishandling. Up until now, the difficult nature of this process caused discrepancies depending on the handlers. However, as we previously mentioned, cell culture imaging technologies can allow for stable processes to eliminate discrepancies among individuals. Moving forward, we intend to begin offering customer support from the cell culture phase as well, rather than exclusively acquiring images after the culture process is finished. Miyamoto: Next are \u201cevaluation\u201d and \u201canalysis.\u201d To review the multiplication of cultured cells, researchers use microscopes to visually inspect changes in cell count or area over time. In cases like this, one researcher may conclude the difference as a 30% increase, while another researcher may observe the same sample as showing a 40% increase. But ideally, these discrepancies should be minimized from a process management perspective. We aid in doing so by acquiring images and analyzing them to provide objective data that indicate changes in cell count, area, viability, and characteristics. We hope to lift researchers\u2019 workload and support reproducible process management through these efforts. \u2014So you removed elements contingent on individual characteristics and formed an objective indicator? Miyamoto: Yes, that is our description. In addition to what we just discussed, I also believe objective indicators can contribute to education and training, not just efficient process management. Specifically, researchers can compare their own visual inspections\u2014say, the rate of cell increase\u2014with that determined by image analysis to review their own instinct in comparison to objective assessments. Each user can utilize analysis results to reflect on their own evaluations\u2014perhaps they thought there was more growth than there actually was, or maybe they see themselves becoming more accurate over time. Tokunaga: In the case of one company that manufactures vaccines utilizing cells, the timing of collecting cultured cells becomes critical in the creation of vaccines. Formerly, each researcher timed collection at their own discretion, which inherently caused discrepencies in cell quality. Under these circumstances, the main concern centered around how accurately skills could be transferred from veteran researchers to the next generation. However, by implementing Nikon\u2019s software, collecting cells at the most appropriate timing is possible with any handler. \u2014What kind of innovation do you expect to see in the future as people gain the abilities of veteran researchers? Miyamoto: One possibility is that organizations with few veterans can receive equipment support through implementing state-of-the-art devices and software, allowing for efficient training of researchers. We may also see more case studies of experiments utilizing new cells. Or perhaps implementing automated systems can lift the workload of researchers so that they may utilize that time for more innovate work, contributing to business expansion. In the future, we also hope to provide a package solution for system fabrication from Nikon. We believe that this is another area in which we can realize becoming \u201ca key technology solutions company in a global society where humans and machines co-create seamlessly.\u201d Tokunaga: Until now, cell culture followed an experience-based method, but digitalization can realize the difficult task of 24-hour management for efficient culturing in a more stable environment. Providing innovations that society needs will become possible by standardizing cell quality management in alignment with past experiences. Aiding abolishment of animal testing with \u201corgan-on-a-chip\u201d and its contributions towards SDGs \u2014Please tell us about Nikon BioImaging Lab. What technologies and services do you provide? Miyamoto: Nikon BioImaging Lab of Japan was established in May 2022 within the Shonan Health Innovation Park (Shonan iPark) in Kanagawa Prefecture. Outside of Japan, we also have labs in the U.S. and Netherlands. Nikon Group\u2019s veteran workers skilled in microscopic cell imaging work here, providing optimal solutions for customers\u2019 issues related to image analysis through advising on various tasks, including equipment setting and specific imaging methods. From our position, this gives us an opportunity consult with numerous companies and grasp the needs of a wide range of customers. We hope to provide even more solutions by accumulating knowledge during this process. Ultimately, operating Nikon BioImaging Lab will boost trust in Nikon as a company, leading to the purchase of products later on. Shonan Health Innovation Park (Shonan iPark) \u2014Why is Nikon\u2019s service to provide imaging and analysis of organs-on-a-chip necessary? Miyamoto: Currently, there is a shift towards eliminating animal testing, which is partly in correlation with achieving SDGs looking towards 2030. While the EU has already prohibited animal testing for cosmetic products, the field of pharmaceuticals has continued testing on animals to assess the effects and toxicity of drugs. In order to eliminate animal testing altogether, organs-on-a-chip can be extremely valuable. Organs-on-a-chip are created by curating cells in a container small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. It is a reproduction of select organs that make up the human body, such as blood vessels and nerves. By administering drugs to reproductions of the human body that are organs-on-a-chip, we can evaluate the effect and toxicity of certain drugs without the need for animal testing. Organs-on-a-chip have already been implemented in many settings, but selecting which chips to choose among a broad and diverse lineup can pose a dilemma for companies, as implementing special equipment by various makers can add up to become a costly investment. At Nikon BioImaging Lab, we consult customers on what experiments they plan to conduct, and collaborate with organs-on-a-chip makers to advise customers on what chips are best suited for their objective while providing knowledge on imaging and analysis. By conducting prior consultations, we help customers to evaluate organs-on-a-chip without the immediate need for implementing special equipment. Co-creating with customers for solutions that enrich society \u2014What contributions can Nikon make by shifting from \u201csales of things\u201d to \u201csales of solution?\u201d Miyamoto: By shifting from \u201csales of things\u201d to \u201csales of solution,\u201d Nikon can propose specific solutions to customers with issues on image acquiring\/analyzing, rather than just offering products. This can also allow us to accumulate more knowledge through interactions with a wider range of customers, which can later help us to provide solutions to even more customers. These are some ways we hope to contribute to society. Instead of ending our services with sales of products, our aim is to take another step further to provide solutions to customers\u2019 issues. \u2014So you intend to offer total support for customers rather than simply selling products. Miyamoto: Customer feedback are also reflected in development of new products. What functions are customers anticipating from Nikon products? And what difficulties are users encountering with them? Unfiltered opinions to questions like these are extremely valuable. While market research is also a significant element of product development, raw feedback often reveals the true needs of customers that are not reflected in marketing activities, so we hope to utilize them in the future, as well. \u2014Please tell us of your future prospects. Miyamoto: By focusing more on \u201csales of solution,\u201d we hope to construct even closer relations with customers and promote co-creation.

Funded by the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe programme, the AlgaeProBANOS project aligns with the Blue Mission BANOS lighthouse initiative, which engages and supports stakeholders across the Baltic and North Sea to reach a carbon-neutral and circular blue economy. The SUBMARINER Network\u2019s initiative falls under the EU\u2019s Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters initiative, which aims to protect and restore the health of our ocean and waters through research and innovation, citizen engagement, and blue investments. The AlgaeProBANOS project The AlgaeProBANOS project is scheduled to span four years and has been allocated a substantial budget exceeding \u20ac12M, including contributions of around \u20ac1M from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The primary focus lies in harnessing the exceptional properties of algae to develop new and valuable products and services for various applications. During this project, the consortium, comprising 26 partners and affiliated entities, will establish acceleration networks and digital solutions to support algae-based businesses. - A message from our partner - Additionally, they will conduct six business pilots across the Baltic and North Sea regions, utilising microalgae and macroalgae for applications in food, feed, nutraceuticals, textiles, cosmetics, and plant biostimulants. The project will bring eight innovative algae-based products to market, helping to meet the growing demand for ecologically friendly, high-quality circular bio-based goods. To ensure the social, environmental and economic sustainability and circularity of the algae sector, partners will develop a framework, while working directly with consumers to raise awareness and ensure new products meet end-user demands and trends. Speaking from the project launch event in Berlin, Angela Schultz-Zehden, Managing Director of the SUBMARINER Network, says, \u201cWe are super excited to be embarking on this new Baltic and North Sea lighthouse project which is among the largest EU-funded algae projects. Only a decade ago, the cultivation and use of algae in Europe was very much at the research stage.\u201d \u201cToday, many large-scale industry players are highly interested in algae as a new bio-resource to improve the environmental footprint of their products. AlgaeProBANOS will make a big contribution to mainstreaming the use of algae in very different industries throughout Europe, making it an everyday commodity for future generations,\u201d adds Schultz-Zehden. The SUBMARINER Network The SUBMARINER Network aims to bring actors from the whole Baltic Sea Region together to actively promote innovative and sustainable uses of marine resources. The platform operates across the whole knowledge triangle integrating perspectives from local to international scale, different science disciplines as well as policy and economic stakeholders. Through meetings, workshops, conferences, and a comprehensive set of dissemination tools, network members are provided with a continuous platform for communication, exchanges of experience, joint project development, and implementation.","filter_flag":1}

Dow expects to purchase this bio-based ethylene, reducing carbon emissions from plastic production, and using it in recyclable applications across transportation, footwear, and packaging. Dow and New Energy Blue to develop renewable plastic materials from corn residue. New Energy Blue, a design\/build\/operate bio-conversion company, envisions a world that runs on green energy in harmony with nature\u2019s carbon cycle and developed the New Energy Biomass Refinery\u2122, a bio-based platform for replacing fossil fuels and chemicals by converting annual agricultural residues and grasses into green renewables for zero-carbon markets. Dow's agreement with New Energy Blue, staffed by experts with deep experience in bio-conversion ventures, is the first agreement in North America to generate plastic source materials from corn stover (stalks and leaves). This is also Dow's first agreement in North America to utilize agriculture residues for plastic production. \"We are unlocking the value of agriculture residues in this new partnership with New Energy Blue,\" said Karen S. Carter, Dow President of Packaging & Specialty Products. \"By committing to purchase their bio-based ethylene, we are helping to enable innovations in waste recycling, meeting demands for bio-based plastics from customers, and strengthening an ecosystem for diverse and renewable solutions.\" Under the terms of the agreement, Dow is supporting the design of New Energy Freedom, a new facility in Mason City, Iowa, that is expected to process 275KT of corn stover per year and produce commercial quantities of second-generation ethanol and clean lignin. Nearly half of the ethanol will be turned into bio-based ethylene feedstock for Dow products. This agreement also gives Dow similar commercial supply options for the next four future New Energy Blue projects, supporting New Energy Blue's ability to scale its production and support farmers by providing a reliable market for agricultural residues. The five projects are expected to displace over one million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions every year. Dow's share of these five projects will also lead to a reduction in its sourcing of fossil fuels and subsequent GHG emissions. This agreement would play a pivotal role in Dow's approach to building material ecosystems that value, source, and transform waste into circular products. By collaborating with the best partners and technologies for collection, reuse, and recycling of waste \u2013 in this case, using a renewable resource \u2013 Dow enables global material ecosystems to scale. \"This collaboration can help redefine how we source raw materials for our products, allowing us to expand to include renewable feedstocks,\" said Manav Lahoti, Dow Global Sustainability Director -Olefins, Aromatics & Alternatives. \"We're excited by the possibility for agriculture-based plastics to help our company achieve both our Transform the Waste goal and our Net Zero CO2 goal. It also aligns with our ambition to increase renewable resource use, paving the way for future commitments.\" \"We're excited to be working with Dow to find solutions that create bio-based plastics from renewable resources,\" said Thomas Corle, CEO of New Energy Blue. \"Together, we're building a future not only in the farm fields of Iowa using corn stover, but across America and around the world using a variety of biomass from grain straws to tall perennial grasses\u2014wherever there's an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions from farming, support farmers in rural communities, and enable the production of the sustainable, low-carbon plastics used in everyday life.\" Through this agreement, Dow would increase its use of renewable yet still recyclable resources, transforming them into products that consumers use every day. Since corn stover releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as it decomposes, Dow's agreement with New Energy Blue would also help reduce carbon emissions from agriculture by reusing this otherwise wasted carbon. Dow's use of bio-based feedstocks from New Energy Blue is expected to be certified by ISCC Plus, an international sustainability certification program with a focus on traceability of raw materials within the supply chain. While Dow intends to mix agriculture-based ethylene into its existing manufacturing process, ISCC Plus's chain of custody certification would allow Dow's customers to account for bio-based materials in their supply chains. Dow's supply agreement with New Energy Blue would create additional economic value for farmers by opening a dependable new market. New Energy Blue's forthcoming Iowa processing facility would source corn stover directly from local farmers every year. Because U.S. farmers' grain yield per acre is among the world's highest, their stover density is correspondingly high. By selling their excess stover for biomass refining, they could reap an excellent second income from the same crop while using farming practices that increase carbon retention in the soil.

In other words, the plant-based industry will ebb and flow before becoming fully established. \u201cLike any new market, they often see rapid growth, a decline, and then stabilization,\u201d Ruberti tells VegNews. \u201cWe\u2019re still early on in this category and it\u2019s going to have its natural ebbs and flows.\u201d Future Farm Prior to Future Farm, Ruberti worked at now-popular energy drink brand Red Bull for 16 years, serving in executive positions at Red Bull Distribution Company USA and Red Bull North America. He is credited with steering the business through incremental growth, and he now brings his wealth of experience to the plant-based industry. As an expert in consumer packaged goods like Red Bull, Ruberti knows a thing or two about bringing innovative products to market. His comparison of the plant-based meat market to the electric vehicles and energy drinks categories highlights the similarities those industries saw. \u201cIf you look at where EVs and energy drinks are now, you can\u2019t drive down the street without seeing an electric car or go into practically any shop without seeing cases full of energy drinks,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cMy point is that plant-based isn\u2019t much different, we\u2019re in it for the long run and will continue to innovate to meet consumer demand,\u201d he says. A future without animal meat Founded in 2019 by Brazilian entrepreneur Marcos Leta and business partner Alfredo Strechinsky, Future Farm\u2019s mission is encapsulated in its name: to create the farm of the future, where plant-based products replace the cruel and unsustainable animal-derived counterparts of the past. Future Farm For his part, Ruberti joined the business because he knows humanity cannot keep consuming traditional animal protein at the rate we do today. And he\u2019s onboard with Future Farm\u2019s mission to change the way the world eats. \u201cAt Future Farm, we envision a world where people choose to eat plants, not animals,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cThat means shifting from an animal-heavy diet to a plant-heavy diet.\u201d Yet he\u2019s also conscious of the sacrifices consumers think they have to make when it comes to sustainable food. \u201cConsumers should know we\u2019re not asking them to ditch traditional protein 100 percent of the time,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cWe understand the process is not from one day to the next, but rather it\u2019s the small choices over time in everyday meals that will leave a positive and lasting impact on the environment.\u201d In other words, small changes in one\u2019s diet\u2014choosing plant-based meat for a meal, for example\u2014actually does make a difference. And educating consumers on this fact is key to adoption. \u201cI think the industry as a whole has to recognize that we\u2019re also in the business of educating people\u2014to show them that they have a choice in what they eat,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cThey can get delicious-tasting protein that doesn\u2019t sacrifice the environment and sustainability.\u201d Future Farm This also means educating them on the sustainability metrics of plant-based food products versus animal products. \u201cOur Future Burger is 100-percent carbon neutral; we\u2019ve partnered with ClimatePartner to track our carbon emissions and plant trees in our backyard, the Amazon Rainforest, to offset those emissions,\u201d Ruberti points out. What sets Future Farm apart The growing plant-based protein industry constantly welcomes new players creating sustainable products. What sets Future Farm apart from these brands? \u201cIt\u2019s really all in our name,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cWe\u2019re creating the farm of the future, where consumers can get delicious food of the future, today.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re forward thinkers and conscious about the environment, so we\u2019re creating products like Future Tuna that continue to push the boundaries and provide some of the highest quality and best-tasting plant-based products on the market,\u201d he says. The company first tackled beef with the launch of its hero product Future Burger, followed by its Future Meatball, Future Beef, and Future Sausage\u2014all of which expanded to the United States in 2021. Future Farm This year, Future Farm is tackling new categories with the launch of Future Chik\u2019n and shelf-stable Future Tuna. Ultimately, it is working on 12 new vegan staples, including honey, milk, hot dogs, and more, to support a transition to a plant-based food system. And because Future Farm products are made with natural ingredients, it allows the brand to create plant-based versions that are comparable in nutritional value to animal protein\u2014but without the downsides. \u201cFuture Farm products mimic the flavor, appearance, and juiciness of traditional protein, but all are non-GMO, gluten-free, 0 percent cholesterol, and most impressive, 0 percent trans fat,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cWe\u2019re sophisticating technology to the point where consumers don\u2019t recognize what is animal protein and what is vegetable protein,\u201d Ruberti says. Ultimately, Ruberti says that in order to get to the point where plant-based meat is as accepted and established as electric cars and energy drinks, we need to shift the conversation to plant-based meat as a food solution to our environmental crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward in the right direction of making food that is sustainable,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cNaturally, it takes time for consumers to adopt different diets and the industry will continue to grow.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Every year more than a billion reach the end of the road. Until recently, most were thrown into landfills or piled up in storage yards, which occasionally caught fire. Tougher environmental laws mean many countries now insist tyres are recycled. And they are, sort of. Some of the methods might be better than dumping them, but they are not especially green. Energy recovery is one common method. This involves burning tyres in an incinerator to generate electricity, or as a supplementary fuel to provide heat for cement kilns and other industrial processes. But that produces planet-warming pollution. Tyres can be used whole or shredded in construction projects, such as building embankments or repairing roads. There are, however, concerns about chemicals from the tyres leaching out and contaminating the ground.","filter_flag":1}

Now, though, there\u2019s a new type of vending machine attracting attention, and it\u2019s not what it sells but how it sells that\u2019s making headlines. The new machine, developed by beverages giant Asahi, paves the way for a new era in automatic vending systems, because it actually absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. What\u2019s more, the CO2 absorbed by the machine will then be used to make industrial materials such as fertilizer and concrete, some of which will be utilized in the building of seaweed beds in the sea, creating a \u201cblue carbon ecosystem\u201d. Asahi says this is the first-ever machine of its type in Japan to contribute to \u201cthe realization of a decarbonised society\u201d. Making the initiative even more impressive is the fact that it\u2019s now past the initial development stage, with patents pending for both the CO2-absorbing vending machine and the CO2-resource recycling initiative that utilizes the vending machine. That means the new machines are ready to be deployed out in the wild, with Asahi planning to install a total of 30 machines in places with high carbon dioxide levels, such as indoor environments, and outdoors in the Kanto and Kansai areas \u2014 the country\u2019s most populous regions in and around Tokyo and Osaka \u2014 in order to compare and verify the amount and speed of CO2 absorption. According to Asahi, vending machines work by sucking in the surrounding air, which it then uses to cool or warm the products inside. The new machines, however, contain a special material that allows the unit to absorb only CO2 from the atmosphere, essentially giving it the same function as a tree, which also absorbs CO2 from its environment. \u25bc More trees means less carbon, which creates a healthier environment, and in a hay-fever-prone country like Japan, it\u2019s a bonus if they don\u2019t produce pollen. Image: SoraNews24 The annual CO2 absorption per unit is expected to set off around 20 percent of the CO2 emissions from the electricity used, which is equivalent to the annual absorption of about 20 Japanese cedar trees aged 56-60 years. Following the initial rollout in June, Asahi plans for full-scale deployment of the machines from 2024. The company says it aims to continue developing materials with high CO2 absorption capacity, in order to eventually develop vending machines that are totally carbon neutral in the future.

Every runner and walker deserves performance product.\u201d Building performance gear for every speed and surface Brooks\u2019 product innovation and human-based insights continue to shine as the brand looks to meet the evolving needs of runners. Brooks\u2019 advancements in nitrogen-infused midsoles\u2014now offered in its cushion, speed, and trail shoes\u2014provide a growing community of runners with products that meet their unique needs. In January, Brooks introduced the Hyperion Max to its speed category, featuring nitrogen-infused DNA FLASH and Rapid Roll rocker technology, with plans to introduce amplified cushioning and additional rocker technology in new styles later this year. Brooks\u2019 cushioning innovation is also winning with runners and walkers with Glycerin franchise sales up 200% year over year. The Glycerin GTS 20 took lead market share in premium priced adult running stability shoes ($150+) at U.S. retail in March.3 In April, the Glycerin 20 was named a finalist by SHAPE magazine in the Best Shoes for Walking category. Brooks expanded its performance trail product offerings with the introduction of the new High Point head-to-toe trail apparel collection. The collection is engineered to deliver optimal range of motion and weather-proof technology to meet the specific needs of trail runners. The brand also launched the Catamount 2 trail shoe, featuring a new SkyVault propulsion plate and TrailTrack rubber outsole for stability and traction on a variety of wet and dry terrain. Furthering commitment to Running Responsibly In April, Brooks issued its annual Corporate Responsibility Performance Report, which communicates the brand\u2019s progress toward its corporate responsibility commitments. In January, Brooks\u2019 near and long-term science-based emission targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In accordance with those targets, Brooks reduced Scope 3 carbon emissions per unit of production by 6% from 2021. Brooks also launched the carbon neutral Ghost 15 in 2022, offsetting 53,140 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through high-quality offsets to make its largest volume product carbon neutral. In line with its commitment to maintain an ethical and sustainable supply chain, Brooks implemented TrusTrace, a leading traceability software, to deepen visibility across our manufacturing supply chain and help identify and mitigate responsible sourcing and business continuity risks. Also summarized in the report was Brooks\u2019 progress against fostering a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. In 2022, Brooks\u2019 representation of women among global employees was at 54% (up 1% from 2021 and outpacing its goal of 50%), and the company exceeded its goal of 30%+ representation of BIPOC among U.S. employees (35% in 2022). For the third consecutive year, Brooks achieved a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees. Investing in the community, advancing the sport In 2022, Brooks invested $5.4 million in community impact initiatives, with a focus on supporting youth running and partners that advance people's health and wellbeing. In March, Brooks launched Future Run, its new youth running initiative to champion youth and help them discover the lifelong benefits of the run and its community. Future Run aims to reach one million young runners in the U.S. over the next five years, supported by a $10 million investment in youth running teams, organizations, and coaches. parkrun, the largest weekly free community event for runners and walkers and Brooks\u2019 new global partner, hit a new participation record in April at over 320,000 runners and walkers worldwide. Brooks and parkrun are working together to foster continual growth of the global running community. At the 127th Boston Marathon, 10 Brooks athletes raced in the elite men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and para-athletic fields. In her debut marathon performance, Erika Kemp, who joined team Brooks in March, ran 2:33:57, making her the fastest U.S.-born Black woman marathoner and a trailblazer for expanding participation in the sport. Timed to Boston, Brooks launched the first-ever Des x Run Boston collection, designed in collaboration with Brooks\u2019 Chief Running Advisor Des Linden to celebrate the five-year anniversary of her 2018 Boston Marathon win. The collection features Linden\u2019s trusted Hyperion Tempo training shoe accented with iridescent raindrops, apparel emblazoned with her \u201cKeep Showing Up\u201d mantra, and a reflective, weather-proof Run Visible jacket.

A circular economy is one where stakeholders are incentivised to reuse and recycle resources. It stands in contrast to a linear economic process whereby raw materials are extracted, converted into products, then thrown away at the end of their useful life. While the concept has deep roots, we today remain overwhelmingly dependent on non-circular consumption. For example, the Circularity Gap Report 2023, produced by global impact organisation Circle Economy in partnership with Deloitte, found that \u2018secondary materials\u2019 \u2013 used materials cycled back into the economy \u2013 only make up 7.2% of all material inputs. Part of the solution for delivering a circular economy is behaviour change from consumers, and supportive policy from regulators and lawmakers. But innovation in technology and processes is also essential. For this reason, and as part of edie\u2019s focus week on the circular economy, our innovations of the month for May are all those that embody circular principles. From green chemicals made from coffee waste to a backpack made of recycled plastic and captured carbon, these solutions give meaning to the proverb \u2018one man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u2019 Photo source GroundTruth A BACKPACK MADE FROM RECYCLED PLASTIC AND CAPTURED CARBON The outdoor recreation industry accounts for around 2% of US GDP. And although the sector promotes connection to nature, many of the materials traditionally used in outdoor apparel are unsustainable. But now materials science company GroundTruth has developed carbon-neutral, vegan, recycled plastic backpacks and carryalls that have a 10-year performance guarantee. The latest product is the 38L Hybrid Duffle Pack that incorporates the company\u2019s latest technology \u2013 hardware that incorporates captured carbon. The packs can be carried by hand, on the back, and across the body, with bottle holders on the front of the pack to make hydrating easy. The bags also open a full 180 degrees for swift accessibility. Notably, each duffle uses 123 plastic bottles for the exterior fabric, and the interior fabric is made from recycled fishing nets. In tests, the captured carbon material performed 40% better than virgin plastic. The waterproof coating on the material contains no volatile organic compounds, and the company works with Bluesign-certified manufacturers that meet Global Recycled Standards for safe and healthy production processes. Photo source Tania Melnyczuk on Unsplash CELLULOSE-BASED INSULATION MADE FROM RECYCLED CARDBOARD The residential sector accounts for 21% of total energy consumption in the US, with over half of a house\u2019s energy usage coming from heating and cooling. Home insulation is one of the swiftest, easiest ways to improve the energy efficiency of a home, and cellulose could be one of the best materials for preventing heat loss. Cleantech company CleanFiber uses recycled cardboard boxes \u2013 many of them from the millions of Amazon orders placed locally \u2013 as the base for its innovative new building insulation. CleanFiber insulation is made by using a proprietary liquid to separate the fibres that make up a cardboard box. The fibres are then infused with an all-borate, liquid fire-retardant before being dried and shredded. Borates help reduce smouldering and combustion should a fire break out. Adding the retardant to the insulation when it is wet creates a cleaner manufacturing process, by eliminating the need to add additional powders to the insulation after it is dried. The final product is a soft, dust-free insulation fibre and tests on building sites indicate that the cellulose insulation is easier to install because it doesn\u2019t get caught in machinery during application. Additionally, during production, CleanFiber removes contaminants from the boxes, making the insulation better for the health of those that produce and install it, and those who live and work in buildings insulated with it. Photo source The University of East London CONSTRUCTION BLOCKS MADE FROM SUGARCANE Sugarcane is the world\u2019s most-produced crop as of 2021 and is grown mostly for use as sugar and ethanol. Bagasse is the waste product left behind after the sugarcane is crushed to harvest the juice. Some of this leftover material is used for biofuel, but much is left to go to waste. And many of the world\u2019s developing countries are key sugarcane producers, so finding a way to turn the bagasse waste into a valuable new product would provide significant support in further developing local economies. Now, a collaborative project based in the University of East London has brought together researchers, commercial partners, sustainability experts, and architects to create Sugarcrete, a concrete brick replacement. According to the team, if only 30% of the world\u2019s bagasse waste was used for Sugarcrete production, the global brick industry could be completely replaced. Sugarcrete bricks are ultra-low carbon and are made by mixing bagasse with mineral binders. A fast-growing crop, sugarcane is an extremely efficient carbon sink. When combined with the low-emission manufacturing process, the final product becomes a particularly sustainable building option. The polyhedral bricks are designed to lock together to create strength without the need for additional supplies. Square slabs of the bricks are held together with only perimeter ties, and the team is working on strengthening the bricks further. The bricks meet industry standards for strength, durability, fire resistance, and thermal properties, and are four times lighter than traditional bricks with only 15% of the carbon footprint. The team has made its research open source to support communities in developing new industries to replace the need to import expensive building supplies. Photo source Mike Kenneally on Unsplash CREATING SUSTAINABLE CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS WITH COFFEE WASTE It is estimated that 6 million tonnes of coffee grounds are sent to landfills each year, where they create methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas that has a greater impact on global warming than carbon dioxide. Now, a technology company from Warsaw, EcoBean, has created a spent coffee grounds collection service that processes waste into green raw materials and products. By doing this, the startup is extending the coffee value chain and making it more sustainable by introducing a circular economy. And for every tonne of coffee ground waste that is collected by EcoBean, 600 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide are prevented from being emitted. EcoBean processes the coffee waste into raw materials, including coffee oil, coffee lignin, lactic acid, and protein feed additives, with a focus on zero-waste production. With these green raw materials, EcoBean has developed a range of circular and sustainable coffee-based products. These usable and recyclable products include EcoBean Flowerpots and EcoBean Straws. The company has also partnered with Dutch startup You Lucky Bird (YLB) to create the You Lucky Bird eco-friendly cups, which are 100%recycled \u2013 made from coffee waste and other vegetable-derived materials. Photo source Max Ducourneau on Unsplash FABRIC PRODUCTS MADE FROM BANANA FIBRES As innovators create new sustainable fibres, the options available to those working in the fashion industry are expanding, making it easier to design and produce products with lower carbon footprints. The new fabrics are exciting, bringing with them increased options and challenges for designers. Additionally, many of the companies behind the latest offerings have broader social goals embedded into their working philosophy. Uganda\u2019s Mawejje Creations, for instance, is a socially minded company that produces textiles made from waste banana plants, fabric offcuts, secondhand clothes, and organic cotton. The business\u2019s Commune Fabric is made for use in fashion and consists entirely of banana crop biowaste. Much like hemp, when grown as part of a sustainable, mixed agricultural crop, the banana plant requires little to no maintenance, making it an excellent replacement for water-heavy cotton crops. Easily grown in Uganda, the banana plant requires no fertiliser or pesticides, and the production process for the fibres ensures that the final fabric is chemical-free. Mawejje Creations also trains young people in the fabric production process and encourages local farmers to use sustainable methods for the highest quality plants. Importantly, part of the training process includes learning certain styles of weaving as a means of preserving and passing along some of the area\u2019s heritage skills. Photo source Barbara Corsico HOUSES MADE FROM RICE The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the buildings and construction industry was responsible for 39% of process and energy-related carbon emissions in 2018, 11% of which come from the production of building materials. Italy-based architectural firm Ricehouse is on a mission to build houses more sustainably, by using rice by-products. The company uses natural waste residues, such as rice straw, husk, and chaff from the rice industry to create circular construction materials, including thermal insulating plasters, finishings, lightweight screeds, and prefabricated panels. Ricehouse obtains the waste directly from local farmers in northern Italy, where the company is based, and rice processing factories. The company believes that engaging in the circular economy, by turning organic waste into a source of value, is vital to green construction and sustainable built environments. And once Ricehouse\u2019s products reach the end of their usable lives, they can either be used in new products or harmlessly returned to nature to break down. The products have high-performance acoustic insulation, as well as having high durability. And because the final rice-based products are effective thermal insulators, it will help houses achieve energy efficiency standards and cut carbon footprints associated with heating. They are also breathable and resistant to harmful biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi \u2013 making them mould-proof. Crucially, the products can be applied using traditional layering techniques and do not require the use of any specialised equipment.","filter_flag":1}

Founded by Annabel Thomas in March 2017, it is revolutionizing the whisky industry through new flavors and carbon-neutral production in harmony with nature. The distillery became the first in the UK to achieve verified net zero carbon emissions status in July 2021. All Nc\u2019nean products are certified organic, bottles are made from 100 percent recycled glass, and waste is almost entirely recycled or reused. Nc\u2019nean received B Corp accreditation in February 2022 and was named \u201cBest for World B Corp. 2022\u201d in July 2022 for its exceptionally positive impact on the environment. We spoke with founder Annabel Thomas in an interview. She talks about the brand philosophy, products and future plans. Please briefly introduce yourself to our readers. Annabel Thomas: Hello, I\u2019m Annabel Thomas, CEO of Nc\u2019nean distillery. Nc\u2019nean is an independent, organic whisky distillery on the west coast of Scotland. Could you please tell us something about the history of Nc\u00b4nean Whisky and how the idea to start your own distillery came about? Annabel Thomas: The distillery is on my parent\u2019s farm and it started as a family idea \u2013 something we talked about around the dinner table. When I had the opportunity to take some time off from my previous job (I was a management consultant in London), I decided to do some more research on the idea, and, especially in contrast to some of the businesses I had worked with previously, I felt there was very little focus on sustainability and very much a \u2018doing things the way they have always been done\u2019 approach. Tradition is so important in Scotch but I felt there was also a role for a distillery that was focused on sustainability and with a more forward looking approach. This was the point that \u2018clicked\u2019 for me \u2013 I felt like this was something I needed to do. So without too much further thought I quit my job and set off on this epic adventure! Two years of fundraising, two years of building later and we finally started production in 2017. How is Nc\u00b4nean whisky different from other Scotch whiskies and what are its distinctive features? Annabel Thomas: From a taste perspective, there are a couple of important things \u2013 firstly it\u2019s organic, and that generates a lovely depth of flavour and texture. Just like organic vegetables, our organic barley grows without the help of fertilizers and pesticides \u2013 richer soils and a tougher life create additional flavours in the grain and this translates through into the spirit. Secondly, we create a really delicious fruity spirit by concentrating on fermentation \u2013 using two yeasts and fermenting for up to 114 hours really allows the flavours to develop in that stage of the process. After maturation in a combination of ex-bourbon, STR red wine and sherry casks, our resulting single malt has delicious notes of citrus, soft fruits and spice. How important is it for Nc\u00b4nean Whisky to consider sustainability and environmental protection and how does that shape the whole production process? Annabel Thomas: Absolutely essential! It is the principle on which we are founded, central to our whole philosophy and deeply embedded within our team. I believe it is incumbent on any modern business to design the business around these principles \u2013 it is clear that we need to move and act quickly to combat climate change. This approach has influenced almost every stage in our production process from using local timber as a renewable source of energy for distillation, buying 100% Scottish organic barley to creating a closed loop cooling pond for our cooling water. We also bottle in 100% recycled clear glass \u2013 this was an industry first and saves 40% of the carbon emissions in its product per bottle. How does the Scottish landscape and environment influence the production of Nc\u00b4nean whisky? Annabel Thomas: On the one hand, completely, and on the other hand, not at all! We are located in such a beautiful, remote and wild part of the world that serves as much of the inspiration for continuous improvement in our sustainability. We also make a botanical spirit which includes several herbs and plants foraged from the local area (which is then combined with our new make spirit to create a really delicious spirit, in the style of a gin). But on the other hand, I am not much of a believer in some of the myths created around Scotch \u2013 and in particularly the emphasis on the water, or the regions of production seem to me to be misleading or overly complicated. We are technically in the Highlands region, but I\u2019m not sure our whisky is typical of that! As a woman, how did you manage to succeed in such a traditionally male-dominated industry, and what challenges did you overcome along the way? Annabel Thomas: I think I have been lucky not to face too many challenges specifically because I am female (though we have faced many many challenges!). The industry is an incredibly friendly place and I have always felt welcomed by everyone \u2013 men and women. And whilst there are not many women in senior roles, there are perhaps more women in the industry than people realise. For distribution in Germany you cooperate Kirsch Whisky. What impact does this partnership have on Nc\u00b4nean Whisky\u2019s business? Annabel Thomas: We have a fantastic partnership with Kirsch and have benefitted hugely from their knowledge of the German market. They are also fun and supportive to work with as a team! Your Organic Single Malt Scotch Whisky struck gold with 95 points at the highly regarded International Wine and Spirits Competition. Congratulations! What does this mean to you and your team? And how did you celebrate? Annabel Thomas: It is always fantastic to receive these lovely validations of our hard work \u2013 from the care the team take in the distillation and looking after our casks to the skill our blender, Matt, we love it! What does the future hold for Nc\u00b4nean Whisky and what plans do you have for new products or developments in production? Annabel Thomas: We are still early on our journey and are focused largely on spreading the Nc\u2019nean word far and wide \u2013 we\u2019re about to launch in the US and will consider a few countries in Asia after that. We obviously have lots of fun experiments still in the warehouse too which we are looking forward to sharing with the world as they reach maturation \u2013 be that more unique yeast trials or some interesting cask types. Watch this space\u2026 In conclusion: If you had to convince a whisky novice to try Nc\u00b4nean whisky, what would be your top three arguments for this exceptional whisky? Annabel Thomas: It\u2019s delicious, pairs brilliantly with soda water, and you\u2019ll be doing great things for the plant at the same time.

In 2022, Bloomberg reported that the sector accounts for up to ten per cent of global carbon dioxide output, and a fifth of the plastic produced globally every year. So what happens when you love fashion, but have a conscience? You look for labels with sustainable credentials \u2013 brands that recycle, use bio-based and degradable materials, minimise their water consumption, provide supply chain transparency, and so on. Sounds easy, right? Well, not so much. With sustainability rising higher on the list of consumer priorities, brands are desperate to tout their green credentials\u2026 even if they don\u2019t really have any. Thus, marketing becomes a minefield of half-truths, vagaries and deliberately nebulous claims, making it harder than ever to decipher whether or not a company actually cares about the environment, or just shareholder profits. Here\u2019s how to navigate the maze. What is greenwashing? \u201cGreenwashing is when companies make sustainability claims without evidence \u2013 this could be from a social and or environmental standpoint,\u201d says Diana Verde Nieto, co-founder and co-CEO at sustainability group Positive Luxury. The term was coined by Jay Westerveld in 1986. He was staying in a hotel that encouraged guests to reuse their towels in the name of the environment, which struck him as ironic considering the establishment\u2019s many other unsustainable practices. Greenwashing is a play on whitewashing, which means hiding or falsifying a situation to make it seem better than it is; companies that greenwash convey a distorted impression of how green their products or practices really are. Trainer company Veja is a B Corp. Image: Vincent Desailly Why do companies greenwash? Greenwashing is an attempt to capitalise on the growing demand for environmentally-friendly products. Companies that do it are \u201ctapping into the customer appeal of being sustainable,\u201d says Verde Nieto. When you look at the numbers, the motive becomes clear. According to GreenPrint\u2019s 2021 Business of Sustainability Index, 64 per cent of Gen X consumers would be willing to pay extra for products deemed green; that figure jumps to 75 per cent for Millennials. A Deloitte survey found that 34 per cent of shoppers had stopped purchasing from certain brands due to ethical concerns. In the UK, the Competition and Market Authority says more than half of consumers take sustainability claims into account when making purchasing decisions. Examples of greenwashing The practice goes back as far as the mid-\u201980s and the infamous case of Chevron. The oil company ran an advertising campaign showing employees protecting bears, butterflies and sea turtles before it emerged that, during this time, Chevron was actively violating the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. In 1991, chemical company DuPont came out with a similarly ironic campaign, announcing the launch of its double-hulled oil tankers with adverts featuring marine animals prancing in chorus to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy. The company was the largest corporate polluter in the US that year. In a 2015 case that took greenwashing to a pretty extreme conclusion, Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting vehicles with software that could detect when it was undergoing testing and reduce emissions \u2013 all while touting the green credentials of the model. Ninety Percent puts 90 per cent of its profits towards charitable and sustainable initiatives In recent years, fast fashion has emerged as a big greenwashing culprit; in a 2021 report, Changing Markets Foundation claimed that as many as 59 per cent of all environmental claims by European and UK fashion brands are misleading. Last year, Zara sparked suspicion for failing to release internal audits after committing to switch to 100 per cent renewable electric energy. H&M and Decathlon, too, have had to revise environmental claims after investigations by The Netherlands\u2019 Authority for Consumer Markets; both promised to \u201cadjust or no longer use sustainability claims on their clothes and\/or websites\u201d. Ultra-fast fashion brands Boohoo and Shein have also caught heat for dubious green practices. The former\u2019s \u2018sustainable\u2019 collaboration with Kourtney Kardashian Barker, and the latter\u2019s decision to appoint a head of sustainability, appeared to be textbook cases of not seeing the wood for the trees. After all, what does one sustainable collection (declared so for containing an unspecified amount of recycled fibres) really mean at a brand that churns out 700 new petrochemical-manufactured styles per week, in Boohoo\u2019s case? And surely a head of sustainability can only be symbolic at Shein, which blows its fast-fashion competitors out of the water with a staggering 10,000 new products being uploaded to its website per day, only six per cent of inventory remaining in stock for more than 90 days, and returns often going into landfill, as it\u2019s cheaper than putting them back into circulation? How do companies greenwash? Greenwashing can manifest itself in many ways. \u201cCompanies might use misleading labelling or imagery \u2013 often nature-based or green \u00ad\u2013 which suggests to people, even subconsciously, that a product is positive,\u201d says Verde Nieto. \u201cIt can also look like vague statements, claims without substantiation, or misleading facts,\u201d she continues. Brands may also use meaningless or unverifiable terminology such as \u2018organic\u2019 or \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 \u2013 alternatively, these claims may refer to only a small percentage of materials used. Labels that greenwash will advertise the use of recycled polyester, for example, in one of 30 steps in the creation of a garment, while the rest of the chain involves unsustainable methods. Stella McCartney has long been a pioneer in green and vegan garments In this vein, companies might market a small, one-off sustainable capsule in a way that implies their entire range is sustainable. They could also try to present standard industry practice as something special; for example, touting a material as having \u2018chrome-free tanning\u2019 makes it seem like an extra, green feature, when actually it\u2019s a basic method of production. Greenwashing may also see brands cherry-picking data (or conducting biased research), or using impressive-sounding credentials that, in actual fact, don\u2019t prove anything. Being OEKO-TEX Standard 100-certified sounds good \u2013 broadly \u2013 but all it means is that the product poses no harm to human wellbeing, and has nothing to do with the environment. Another term that sounds positive, but requires more digging into, is \u2018net zero\u2019. Companies that claim to be \u2018net zero\u2019 probably haven\u2019t put the work in to reduce their carbon footprint; they may instead have paid for carbon offsetting, which has been found to be massively flawed. An analysis by The Guardian earlier this year suggested that more than 90 per cent of rainforest carbon offsets by the biggest certifier are worthless. Another thing to watch out for is vegan leather \u2013 just because it isn\u2019t an animal product, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better for the planet. Many vegan garments are simply made out of plastic, rather than genuinely sustainable alternatives like grape or mushroom leather. How to spot \u2013 and avoid \u2013 greenwashing Buildings have energy efficiency ratings. There are health grading systems on most packaged foods in the UK \u2013 these metrics may be imperfect, but they push the needle. There\u2019s no real, standardised rating system for environmental friendliness in fashion. So, until we get this, what can you do to ensure you\u2019re buying sustainably? There are a number of fairly foolproof certifications you can look for, says Verde Nieto: \u201cFSC for packaging, or the Butterfly Mark for luxury brands, show[s] they are on a journey of sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance) excellence. Cruelty Free ensures that the products are not tested on animals.\u201d Is the brand a B Corp or Fair Trade certified? These organisations go some way to substantiating ethical claims. In 2021, Swarovski released a measurable and science-based six-point sustainability mission As a more general rule, Verde Nieto reminds that \u201cwhen something is too good to be true, it probably is!\u201d, and urges consumers to \u201cquestion it\u201d. If a company is shouting about a sustainable initiative, look into its wider practices. Do they live up to that one capsule or collection more broadly? The same goes for throwing around noncommittal terms like \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 with no context. Don\u2019t be taken in by claims about production methods or random certifications: they may not mean what you think they do. Check the source of data or research. Don\u2019t be fooled by packaging. If something is described as \u2018recycled\u2019, how much of it? If something is \u2018net zero\u2019, how have they achieved this? What is a vegan product actually made of? Can fashion brands be sustainable? What are some genuinely sustainable practices that brands can engage in? \u201cHave ESG targets beyond net zero (carbon is just one part of the puzzle). Have an ESG baseline. Have a transitional plan in order to meet your targets,\u201d says Verde Nieto. \u201cBe transparent in the communication of all the above, acknowledging where there is work to do as well as the good stuff.\u201d Take apparel and beauty brand Bamford as an example. 94 per cent of the brand\u2019s collections are made using renewable and biodegradable fibres, produced responsibly (think certified dyestuffs and water recycling systems). Or Pangaia, which has developed materials such as FLWRDWN\u2122 (a down alternative created from wildflowers) and C-FIBER\u2122 (a material developed from eucalyptus pulp and seaweed). Pangaia has developed innovate eco-friendly materials Few brands have taken the plunge and rejected the seasonal cycle of fashion, which constantly renders clothes obsolete and encourages consumers to buy more. Stockholm brand Asket, however, sells a single, permanent collection of timeless pieces. Then there\u2019s Ninety Percent, which shares 90 per cent of its profits between charitable causes and the production of sustainable materials \u2013 that\u2019s what you call putting your money where your mouth is. The concept behind Re\/Done, meanwhile, is repurposing old jeans, while footwear brand Alohas operates an on-demand shopping platform, meaning that users order in advance of production to eliminate waste. There are plenty of small brands out there whose whole raison d\u2019etre is sustainability. But what about brands with lots of skin in the game? Can you change an established business model? Well, yes \u2013 legacy brands can engage in meaningful sustainability initiatives too, if the inclination is there. In 2021, Swarovski released a seemingly genuinely measurable and science-based six-point sustainability mission. Stella McCartney has long been a pioneer in green and vegan garments; its AW23 collection includes both mushroom and grape leather, as well as hidden QR codes that take you to details about a garment\u2019s production \u2013 talk about transparency. Gabriela Hearst has similarly put sustainability at the heart of her brand. The designer staged the first carbon-neutral fashion show during SS20\u2019s New York Fashion Week, and around 25 per cent of collections are made from deadstock. Gabriela Hearst staged the first carbon-neutral fashion show during SS20\u2019s New York Fashion Week The future of greenwashing \u201cSustainability is now becoming a regulated area \u2013 there are rules about what companies can and cannot do, and the same applies to their communications,\u201d says Verde Nieto. Under the soon-to-pass Digital Markets, Competition And Consumer Bill, the CMA will have the power to impose civil penalties on companies that make misleading environmental claims, which will count as a breach of consumer law. Verde Nieto believes that the days of greenwashing \u201care almost gone\u201d, but, clearly, there are still hundreds of thousands of consumers willing to buy from the Sheins of the world. As long as there is demand for rock-bottom-cheap, readily-available fashion, the industry will struggle to shake its polluting reputation. That said, a crackdown on deceptive marketing may be the first stone laid in the building of a greener industry. Read more: The rise of the celebrity creative director","filter_flag":1}

The NPD will join Wyke\u2019s carbon neutral Ivy\u2019s Reserve Vintage Cheddar, which launched last year. The creation of a new carbon neutral butter was made possible due to investment in a new \u201csuper-efficient\u201d butter dairy powered by home-produced renewable electricity and gas. It was both energy and water efficient, the business said. The new product is part of Wyke Farms\u2019 five-year plan for growth, underpinned by sustainably increasing volume and strategically targeting specific export regions worldwide. Wyke Farms partnered with Carbon Trust to undertake a cradle-to-grave footprint analysis, which certified the footprint of Ivy\u2019s Reserve salted farmhouse butter as carbon neutral in accordance with PAS2050, an internationally recognised specification. The company will now produce freshly churned butter with longer shelf-lives allowing for shipping to premium export markets, as well as driving a reduction in waste both in store and at home. \u201cIncreasingly, people across the world are looking for premium dairy products with provenance and history \u2013 butter is no exception and Ivy\u2019s Reserve salted farmhouse butter is a best-in-class product in terms of quality and sustainability, and it articulates our unique set of values that fit with this trend,\u201d said Rich Clothier, managing director of Wyke Farms. The butter is made with whey cream from cows in the southwest and is formulated according to Grandmother Ivy\u2019s secret family recipe.","filter_flag":1}
