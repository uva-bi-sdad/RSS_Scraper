Unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, this award-winning solution provides energy independence automating energy production, storage, measurement, and control \u2013 all from a single, easy-to-use app. The announcement was made during RE+ 2023, the largest event in North America for the clean energy industry. Schneider Electric has a significant presence at this year's conference, with executives featured in seven expert sessions, including North America CEO, Annette Clayton joining the opening session roundtable co-hosted by Kal Penn, Former Associate Director, White House Office of Public Liaison, and Van Jones, CNN Host & President of Magic Labs Media. Schneider Electric begins to take orders for Schneider Home, an integrated home energy management solution Post this \"As the need for resilience and decarbonization becomes ever more urgent, it's imperative that the growing range of energy users--organizations, businesses, utilities and consumers--contribute to a shared grid,\" said Annette Clayton, CEO, North America, Schneider Electric. \"This trend will require innovative technology to accelerate the electrification of homes, buildings and transport, EV charging infrastructure and microgrids.\" Clayton concluded, \"Empowering everyone from homeowners to commercial and industrial customers with more visibility and decision making over their energy consumption is critical as this collection of energy conscious prosumers will make up the new energy landscape.\" Schneider Home is a comprehensive solution that includes a smart electrical panel, a home battery for clean energy storage, a high-power solar inverter, an electric vehicle (EV) charger and connected electric sockets and light switches, all connected to intelligently orchestrate home energy. In contrast to existing solutions which require separate apps and disjointed hardware, Schneider Home eliminates that complexity, providing homeowners the ability to easily monitor energy consumption by individual appliance, decide where to prioritize power during an outage to extend available back up power and avoid expensive electrical service upgrades when purchasing an EV. Schneider Electric's announcements provide transformative approach for net-zero carbon efforts Schneider Electric also announced that its EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex and the EcoXpert Microgrid Badge certification program are now available. These new offerings are the latest in Schneider Electric's efforts to meet the growing needs of today's prosumer. EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex, also an industry first, standardizes microgrid development to drastically reduce project timelines. It fuses microgrid controls, electrical distribution, software, and Schneider Electric's all-in-one Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to simplify traditional microgrid configuration for faster and simpler implementation. Partners will gain access to a new microgrid design approach, EcoStruxure Microgrid Build, a web-based tool that helps to configure, program, and deploy microgrid control algorithms. Meanwhile, the EcoXpert Microgrid Badge program is set up to deliver needed certification, training, and a mutually beneficial partnership program to enable participants to succeed in the growth of microgrid adoption. EcoXpert Microgrid Badge certification highlights partners' competence in designing and implementing microgrid solutions. Partners can become advanced system integrators adept at helping organizations manage loads and distributed energy resources, yielding more sustainable and resilient energy systems. According to Guidehouse Insights, Schneider Electric is the leading microgrid integrator globally due to its microgrid services, technologies, and innovative scope of delivery through joint ventures. Customers, like Bimbo Bakeries, benefit from Schneider Electric's expertise in delivering high-quality, strategic solutions in the microgrid value chain, enabling customers to achieve new heights in decarbonizing their energy operations. \"Grupo Bimbo and Bimbo Bakeries USA are committed to Net Zero Carbon by 2050,\" said Chris Wolfe, Bimbo Bakeries USA's Senior Director of Environmental Sustainability. \"These onsite microgrids represent a key component to our diversified strategy.\" Schneider Electric reveals bidirectional EV charging Optimized energy use is crucial for a net-zero future. Schneider Electric is unifying commercial and residential customers in this endeavor by enabling bidirectional charging, such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) functionalities. With more than 100 years of energy management innovation and existing projects, like the one powered by zero-emissions electric buses in Oakland, California, Schneider Electric is positioned to deliver on the promise of a two-way energy paradigm. Customers will be able to future-proof their EVs as they become dynamic energy assets that can produce emergency backup power for homes (V2H), reduce homeowner costs and electric supply strain by selling excess power back to the grid (V2G), and reduce carbon emissions by harnessing renewable energy. RE+ attendees visiting the Schneider Electric booth (#5343) will get a 'first-look' at the company's all-in-one bi-directional EV charging prototype expected to be commercially available in 2025. Schneider Electric's bi-directional EV charger will enable full home backup, high power charging, plug and play integration of solar and stationary storage and optimized installation costs with its simple, integrated design. For more information, visit Schneider Electric at RE+ (Sands Expo Level 2, Booth #5343) to learn more about these announcements.

This marks Anker's debut at the renowned clean energy conference following the June launch of the Anker SOLIX brand, as the company expands its presence in the home energy solutions market. Anker, global leader in charging and power delivery, showcases Next-Generation Home Energy Solutions at RE+ 2023 Post this Anker SOLIX's new X1 is a super powerful home battery backup system featuring an ultra-slim modular design that will seamlessly blend into any home d\u00e9cor. It is customizable with up to six battery packs per system (30 kWh) or up to six systems in parallel (180 kWh). During the event, Anker will introduce two innovative products - the Anker SOLIX X1 Home Energy Solution and the Anker SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station - to industry professionals in the United States. These products demonstrate Anker's commitment to redefining energy independence for consumers. As the home energy storage market experiences rapid growth, Anker conducted a survey of 500 U.S. consumers who own single-family residences with solar panels installed. The survey revealed key insights for those with and without battery backup systems. Homeowners with a Solar and Battery Backup Solution: Decision to Invest Goes Beyond the \"Backup\": Most purchasing decisions were driven by homeowners' desire to safeguard their homes from power outages (51%), followed by reducing energy costs (44%). However, almost one-third of homeowners (29%) say they chose to purchase a home battery backup solution to increase the value of their property.
