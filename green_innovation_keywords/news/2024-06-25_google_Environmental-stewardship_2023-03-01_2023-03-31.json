The companies recently released their 2022 Keep It. Give It. annual corporate social responsibility report, detailing more than $782,000 in donations to over 100 nonprofits in the last year. The suppliers also shared progress on their goal to become carbon-neutral on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission by the end of 2024 and reaching affiliation status with the Fair Labor Association. Koozie Group employees at its Clearwater, FL, location assemble backpacks full of school supplies to donate to the United Way. Developed with input from employees, the Keep It. Give It. program launched in late 2020 and focuses on four key areas: fostering diversity, equity and inclusion; giving back to employees and community; safety and social responsibility; and environmental stewardship. The annual report recaps year-end highlights in each area and outlines Koozie Group and IMAGEN Brands\u2019 future goals. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see cross-functional support for our Keep It. Give It. program,\u201d said Pierre Montaubin, Koozie Group chief product and sustainability officer. \u201cLast year, we met some big milestones, including exceeding our KG Factor goal over a year early. We\u2019ve laid an excellent foundation over the last few years, and I\u2019m excited for the next 24 months as we strive to hit our carbon-neutral and Fair Labor Association objectives.\u201d In addition to the $782,000 donated to nonprofits in 2022, the suppliers participated in a variety of charitable undertakings, including donating product valued at more than $400,000 for Hurricane Ian relief. The suppliers donated $10,000 to the Promotional Products Education Foundation, and 10% of sales of IMAGEN Brands\u2019 Hey Buddy bear were donated to the National League for Nursing. Koozie Group and IMAGEN Brands donated over 2,000 backpacks full of school supplies to local United Way chapters in Minnesota and Florida last year. A portion of proceeds from IMAGEN Brands plush sales were donated to 4 Paws for Ability, a nonprofit that provides service dogs to people with disabilities. Company employees also raised over $8,000 for food pantries and other local organizations. Koozie Group and IMAGEN Brands highlighted their sustainability achievements from 2022 in their Keep It. Give It. report. On the sustainability side, Koozie Group earned Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for all domestic facilities and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certification for its Sleepy Eye, MN, facility, with over 450 products made with paper from certified mills. More than 1,800 products \u2013 or over 70% \u2013 of its products now carry the KG Factor designation, which identifies products whose designs lessen environmental impact through longevity. Over 1,000 products are made, printed or assembled in the U.S, which the suppliers say reduces their overall carbon footprint. And more than 100 products are made with recycled or renewable resources. Looking forward, the suppliers are continuing work toward achieving carbon neutrality on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by the end of 2024. They\u2019ve also started to measure Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Among the efforts to reduce emissions is undergoing EcoVadis audits to measure against United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and reach and maintain a score of 90% or above. The companies are also working on improving water use during printing and minimizing supply chain packaging to reduce their carbon footprint. Another goal being worked toward is to stop using plastic packaging for Koozie Group acrylic drinkware, which the company says will eliminate the need for up to 1.9 million plastic bags per year. \u201cThis is a critical time in the promotional products industry as we address the issues facing our planet,\u201d Montaubin said. \u201cSustainability is important not only to our distributors and their end-users, but also to our employees and their families.

(\"Koch\") has earned the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ENERGY STAR\u00ae Partner of the Year Award for 2023. This is the third consecutive year Koch has earned this award and the fourth overall, maintaining its status in ENERGY STAR's Sustained Excellence category. ENERGY STAR award winners lead their industries in the production, sale and adoption of energy-efficient products, homes, buildings, services and strategies; it is the highest honor bestowed by the EPA. Employees across Koch companies work to use fewer resources as they create the life-sustaining essentials and everyday products that help people improve their lives. Koch has maintained a high performance level since joining the ENERGY STAR program in 2015, earning the agency's ENERGY STAR certification at four facilities in the pulp and paper, refining and fertilizer industries in 2022, a designation reserved for manufacturing facilities in the top 25% of energy efficiency in their sector. \"Being recognized again by the EPA for superior energy performance is an important milestone for Koch,\" said Sheryl Corrigan, director of environmental, health and safety at Koch Industries. \"Our employees drive, design and implement energy improvement initiatives and projects at our sites, together with our customers, suppliers and community partners. We all win by using fewer resources. Receiving this award is a testament to our employees' innovations that drive process enhancements, as well as our ongoing investments in new technology.\" Each day at Koch, employees apply Koch's Stewardship Framework to help them continually improve their performance as they responsibly make the products and provide the services that people value over their alternatives. Koch is one of the largest U.S. manufacturers and ENERGY STAR partners, and its facilities have successfully reduced energy consumption and associated emissions, compared to both domestic peers and facilities that less efficiently manufacture imported products. From 2014 to 2021, production-related waste at Koch's U.S. facilities is down by 250 million pounds (approximately 40%), across its numerous industries, according to the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory report. Of the waste produced and reported to the EPA at Koch facilities in 2021, 90% was recycled, recovered for energy or treated\u2014a total of 369 million pounds. Koch has invested more than $1.8 billion in energy efficiency projects across its more than 300 U.S.-based facilities throughout the last decade. This work includes DEPCOM Power, a Koch Engineered Solutions (KES) company, partnering with fellow Koch company Flint Hills Resources to construct a 45-megawatt supplemental solar power plant with more than 100,000 panels for Flint Hills' Pine Bend refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota. The under-construction facility is believed to be one of the largest of its kind in the United States, increasing the refinery's efficiency by generating enough energy to power 6,500 homes annually. Together with the facility's recently completed Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, 70% of the facility's power needs will come from highly efficient on-site energy generation. Integrating stewardship innovation into daily operations across hundreds of manufacturing facilities, employees at Koch company Georgia-Pacific's (GP) Collaboration and Support Center (CSC) are combining data, artificial intelligence, process control and cloud technology in managing the company's manufacturing assets and process health. The CSC partners with GP facilities across the country to optimize operations and improve energy management. Its partnership with GP's cellulose plant in Brunswick, Georgia, uses AI with sensors to monitor energy and operations data to help predict and prevent potential issues before they happen.

The Circular Economy experiments implemented by the Accelerator Lab of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pacific Office in Fiji is an opportunity to strengthen waste management, reduce plastic pollution and create more economic opportunities in Fiji. Plastic pollution is especially problematic for island nations in the Pacific Ocean due to its vast expanse and the sheer amount of plastic being leaked from coastal areas or carried via ocean currents. By shifting towards a circular economy model, countries in the Pacific can create more sustainable pathways for tackling the plastic waste problem and reap the economic benefits associated with this model. At the heart of circular economies are efforts to end resource waste, reduce environmental impact and increase efficiency. The move to a circular economy reduces the negative environmental consequences of our current \u2018take-make-waste\u2019 system, and encourages more reuse, repair, and recycle initiatives to counterbalance energy and material consumption from natural resources. The Pacific region is especially vulnerable to the issues caused by single-use plastics, as the pollution that comes from the production and use of these materials are a serious threat to the fragile and beautiful ocean environments, fishing grounds, and marine ecosystems which Pacific islanders are dependent on for food, transportation, and livelihood. In Fiji, UNDP is creating and supporting multiple local initiatives and projects, working directly with local communities and partners to tackle plastic pollution. These initiatives range from creating awareness and education programs, to piloting the collection of post-consumer plastic waste and repurposing it into new products and materials, thereby promoting circular economies that are improving plastic waste management. The circular economy model is one that is essential to promoting sustainable efforts in Fiji and other nations. The way that circular approaches to the economy look to re-use, repair, and recycle processes and materials, of all types, is invaluable. Particularly in the matter of plastics, the reuse of these materials through traditional and innovative strategies can significantly reduce the amount of harmful waste found in the ecosystems or town boundaries. It is therefore crucial that town councils in Fiji are involved in the conversation around this, and work to implement, circular economic strategies especially in their day-to-day functions in managing council duties. This can be done through effective education, regulation as in fees or fines, and investment of these bodies, and the effective adoption of a circular economy in Fiji can be realized. These were the sentiments of Ms. Setaita Qalilawa, the Assistant Health Inspector for Nausori Town Council.","filter_flag":1}

Applicants must register to the Atamis platform before an application can be made. For further information and application see the Atamis landing page: Welcome (force.com) The SRPCGS can be searched for using the \u2018Find Opportunities\u2019 page and searching using either the title - Species Recovery Programme, or the code C5132. What is the Species Recovery Programme? Natural England (NE) has been delivering its flagship Species Recovery Programme (SRP) for over 30 years focussing on bespoke conservation action to reverse the fortunes of our most threatened native species. How does the Species Recovery Programme operate? The Species Recovery Programme comprises three components: 1) Memorandums of Agreement (MoAs) between NE and partners setting out a formal way of working together to deliver shared project objectives; 2) a new third-party external grants scheme; 3) monitoring and evaluation of the outcomes and effectiveness of the SRP. Capital research and development is funded through contracts and MoAs between Natural England and partner organisations; whilst capital interventions for targeted species through transfer payments to third parties are funded by the external SRPCGS. How do MoAs and Grants differ? Capital Research and Development (R&D) is funded through MoAs (and contracts) between Natural England and partner organisations, whilst capital interventions for priority and threatened species will be delivered through a competed grants scheme shortly to open for external applications. Capital Grant Scheme Purpose What is the Species Recovery Programme Capital Grant Scheme? Natural England is launching a new capital grant scheme - the Species Recovery Programme Capital Grant Scheme (SRPCGS) which complements and builds upon the existing Species Recovery Programme. The grant scheme will run over two financial years (23\/24 and 24\/25) and funding is entirely capital. All works, reporting and claims will need to be completed by March 2025. To be eligible for capital grant funding, projects need to include the enhancement or creation of heritage assets (i.e. an area of land supporting wildlife habitats) which benefit species recovery; and\/or conservation translocations of target species that enhance habitats to enable them to function effectively. Species eligibility Which species are eligible? Priority species \u2013 those species named in Section 41 of the NERC Act 2006 (as revised); species classified as Extinct in the Wild, Regionally Extinct, Threatened (critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable) or Near Threatened on IUCN Red Lists at England scale, GB scale or International scale (if there are no England\/GB scale assessments). A full list of eligible species will be provided when the application window opens. Application process Who can apply? Partnerships, individual organisations and business who are formally constituted; and who are readily able to deliver species recovery objectives. Those not registered may work in partnership with a lead organisation that is registered or formally constituted. The grant is not available for central government departments, their executive agencies; non-departmental public bodies or unregistered organisations. Government bodies may, however, contribute to projects if a third-party grant recipient leads the work and has formal \u2018management control\u2019 agreed. Private individuals cannot apply; however, an individual as a consultant could be a partner (or sub-contractor) in a bid led by an eligible body. What scope is there for multiple organisations\/partners to try to initiate collaborative projects? We welcome collaborative projects and expect applicants to explore collaboration with other parties that can add value and reduce duplication of applications. Applications from partnerships will need to identify the lead partner in the application. What are the criteria for assessing applications? Projects must focus on action for Priority, Threatened or Near Threatened species contributing to the Environment Act target to reduce the risk of extinction. Project actions and outputs funded by the SRPCGS must fit within the Capital Departmental Expenditure Limit (CDEL) criteria which will be explained in the Invitation To Apply. Projects must aim to move species along their Species Recovery Curves by undertaking action to deliver recovery solutions. Further details will be provided in the Invitation to Apply. Projects must represent good value for money (i.e., reasonable overall costs, appropriateness of costings and match contributions). It is also desirable to deliver added value by undertaking action for multiple species (recovery assemblages \/ integrated package of actions) in an ecologically coherent or themed way, as well as promoting stakeholder engagement with species recovery. When will the applications open? And for how long? We intend to open the two-year grant scheme for applications on 3rd April 2023, for a period of six weeks. The first two weeks will include a clarification period where prospective applicants can ask further questions. All questions and answers will be made available to all prospective applicants via the grant application platform called Atamis. Will there be a second application window? No, we are not planning to have a second round of applications, but we may need to if we are under-subscribed. Can more than one application be submitted? Yes, an organisation can submit more than one application themselves or be involved in a partnership with others, provided they have capacity to manage the proposed projects, if successful. We welcome collaborative projects and expect applicants to explore collaboration with other parties that can add value and reduce duplication of applications. Is match funding an essential part of the bid? Match funding (cash and\/or in-kind) is a desirable and favoured element, in particular to support non-capital elements such as public engagement, but is not essential. Note that value for money is one of the grant criteria, this will include overall costs, appropriateness of costings and match contributions. Is there a minimum and maximum grant award per project? We are seeking grant requests of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3500,000 over two financial years. How will payments be made? NE will make grant payments quarterly in arrears for eligible expenditure against agreed objectives, as set out in the recipients grant funding agreement which references the grant application.

In 2023, there are numerous large and small-scale businesses in the industry, from those focusing on wild-caught fish to aquaculture farms raising their own stocks of fish. Wild-caught fisheries often have vessels out at sea for weeks or months at a time, with a focus on sustainable harvesting of local fish populations. Aquaculture operations, on the other hand, typically involve growing fish in tanks or pens, either onshore or off, and then selling them to distributors and retailers. Many US fishery companies also export their products to other countries, enabling them to reach a much larger customer base. With increased demand for seafood worldwide, these businesses have become increasingly important players in the global food industry.

They also provide vital economic activities, such as boating, chartering, processing, marketing, and tourism. In addition, fisheries contribute to healthy marine ecosystems by providing valuable habitat for many species of fish and other marine life. As global demand for seafood continues to grow, it is increasingly important for fishery companies in the USA to remain competitive in order to ensure the sustainability of their businesses.

Organic agriculture in the United States has grown significantly over the past decade, with sales of organic products reaching $51.5 billion in 2019. Organic farmers use crop rotation, composting, and other techniques to maintain soil health without using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. They also avoid genetic modification and other types of modern technology that can affect the health of the environment. In addition, many organic farmers use cover crops, which are plants that help improve soil structure, suppress weeds, and prevent erosion. Organic production has become increasingly popular among both large and small-scale farmers due to its numerous environmental and economic benefits. Many large companies have implemented organic standards for their products, such as Whole Foods, which only sells items labeled \u201cUSDA Certified Organic.\u201d Smaller companies, such as Nature\u2019s Path, have also begun to focus more on organic farming and offer a wider range of organic products. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers certification programs for organic producers, which help consumers identify organic products. In addition, there are many organizations in the US dedicated to promoting organic agriculture, such as the Organic Trade Association and Certified Naturally Grown. These organizations provide resources and networking opportunities for organic farmers and businesses. Organic agriculture is an important part of the US economy and has the potential to benefit both consumers and the environment in the future. As the industry continues to grow and evolve, more people are becoming aware of the importance of organic farming and are making conscious choices to support it. IMPORTANCE Organic agriculture companies in the USA in 2023 are facing numerous challenges to remain competitive. One of the biggest challenges is access to markets and the rising cost of inputs such as land, labor, and technology. The demand for organic produce has increased, but customers have become more price-sensitive. Additionally, traditional farming methods have become less efficient due to soil depletion, water scarcity, and climate change. To remain profitable, organic agriculture companies must find ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and differentiate their products from competitors. To reduce costs, organic agriculture companies have turned to technological solutions such as robotics and automation. These technologies can help reduce labor costs while still maintaining quality and crop yields. Companies may also use precision farming techniques to improve yield and reduce input costs. Additionally, many companies are investing in the development of more sustainable growing practices such as permaculture, composting, and water conservation techniques. Organic agriculture companies must also focus on developing strategies to increase customer loyalty and create brand recognition. Companies should invest in marketing campaigns to educate consumers on the benefits of organic produce and demonstrate the value of their products. Additionally, companies should work to build relationships with local retailers, farmers\u2019 markets, and other channels to increase market access. Finally, organic agriculture companies must differentiate their products from those of competitors. This could be done through product innovation, such as introducing new flavors and varieties, or by certifying their products as organic or using sustainable packaging materials. By implementing these strategies, organic agriculture companies can continue to remain competitive and profitable in the rapidly evolving organic produce market.
