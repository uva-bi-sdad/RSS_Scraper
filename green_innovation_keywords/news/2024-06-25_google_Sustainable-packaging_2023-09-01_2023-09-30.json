Eyeris\u00ae offers unparalleled visual appeal in line with the growing consumer demand for sustainable packaging. With over 40,000 Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) launches monthly across 273+ categories1, the competition for shelf placement and consumer attention has intensified. Notably, at the point of purchase,product packaging plays a pivotal role, with 76% of consumers saying it influences their final purchase decisions, while 66% of consumers try new products solely due to their packaging2. Unlike traditional printing methods, Eyeris\u00ae uses advanced printing and imaging processes to deliver high-resolution, photo-realistic images directly onto the aluminum packaging surface. This ground-breaking HD imagery spans 360 degrees around the can or bottle, offering not only unparalleled detail and color accuracy to visually showcase ingredients and fragrances within the product, but also offers brands a unique platform to tell their story while creating a strong emotional connection with consumers. Leveraging Ball\u2019s unique expertise in creative artwork, Eyeris\u00ae has the potential to better replicate customer graphics and imagery when developing files for print, ensuring the final product achieves higher detail and quality. Available in up to nine colors, Eyeris\u00ae caters to all dimensions and forms within Ball\u2019s portfolio of aluminum cans and impact extruded bottles for beverages, household items, and personal care products. This versatility unlocks visual possibilities that capture consumers\u2019 attention by combining Eyeris\u00ae with aluminum packaging, one of the most sustainable packaging solutions available today. \u201cConsumers are increasingly demanding sustainable packaging solutions for household and personal care products. Our new report explores how Eyeris\u00ae enables brands to stand out with vivid imagery, while also aligning with the sustainability attributes of aluminum \u2013 which is safe, lightweight and infinitely recyclable regardless of shape, color or format,\u201d said Victoria Marletta, Commercial Vice President, Aerosol Packaging at Ball Corporation. \u201cEyeris\u00ae provides a significant step forward in packaging design technology. We\u2019re excited to partner with our customers to provide this innovative and versatile solution for brands to communicate with their customers.\u201d As a leader in sustainable aluminum packaging innovation, Ball launched the lightweight Aerosol aluminum cans using their proprietary alloy ReAl in 2014 to reduce emissions from transportation. These Aerosol cans are up to 30% lighter than standard ones and contribute to a reduction in transportation-related emissions. However, widespread adoption of lightweighting has led to standardized can shapes and sizes and less differentiation. Eyeris\u00ae is designed to address this issue by ensuring brands and on-pack promotions stand out on the shelf in a crowded market, where creativity may feel squeezed, and captivate consumer attention. Eyeris\u00ae reflects Ball\u2019s commitment to innovation and sustainability, offering purpose-powered solutions that help brands elevate their packaging while contributing to a more sustainable world. When combined with Eyeris\u00ae technology, aluminum packaging not only fulfils but amplifies both sustainability and consumer engagement by allowing high-resolution printing directly on the package, thereby eliminating the need for additional labels.

There is a lot of brand competition right now, and for smaller brands that have disruptive ideas, we can help them launch right out of the gate with strong sustainability claims and uniqueness, versus established brands that are having a more challenging time shifting their current offering to becoming more sustainable. We think it is an exciting time for new products, and we want to help those brands launch with strong sustainability claims effectively and efficiently. HCT has a new collection of tools that they are very excited about, including a new refillable palette, a refillable monomaterial pump, and refillable jars. The Refillable PET Palette is a monomaterial PET design created to be a bit different from what is currently available on the market, featuring a new refillable pan system that is compatible with multiple palette designs. The pan holder will be available in multiple materials, starting with PET, which is recyclable, as well as in different sizes that will work for face powders (bronzer, highlighter, blush, foundation), and eye shadow. The idea is to reuse the same pan system with different palettes\u2014larger or smaller sizes, mix-and-match product categories\u2014offering consumers a custom-curated palette experience from a brand they love. The PET version is the first design to launch, with more designs planned in the pipeline. The Monument Pump was created as a more unique design solution to your typical refillable pump by allowing the consumer to reuse the actuator and base. The refill PP bottle comes with the monomaterial PP pump already assembled and can be recycled as one piece. The user only needs to drop the recyclable bottle (and pump) into the outer bottle and snap the actuator on. At the end of use, you separate the actuator from the bottle and pull out the inner pump for recycling. We are producing additional versions with glass, aluminum, and silicone outer bottles in order to offer more options for brands to play with different materials and aesthetics. The PP pump version will be available in 30 mL, with more sizes in the works. The Hush jars are monomaterial PP featuring a unique recessed design on the lid, allowing the jars to easily stack on top of each other. A typical refillable jar has a narrower neck, making it difficult to access all the product. The Hush Jars feature a wider opening with a hidden thread inside, allowing for easier access to the product until the last drop. The PP version is currently available in 30 mL and 50 mL. Larger volumes will be available soon for haircare and bodycare products. The larger opening also creates an easier experience for popping out the inner pod. Like the Refillable PET Palette and the Monument Pump, the Hush Jar will also be available in different materials for the cap and base, including aluminum, silicone, cement, glass, and various bio-based materials. HCT is pushing the limits of sustainable design by offering different materials and design options to meet customer needs and deliver a more playful experience to both brands and their consumers. HCT is encouraging brands to reach out to set up a meeting to explore new stock tools and find ways to help them make the shift to a more sustainable future. Sustainability isn\u2019t easy, but it can be beautiful and fun. Send HCT an email at info@hctgroup.com.","filter_flag":1}

In fact, 70% of consumers assessed regularly buy private label, with 50% of these planning to continue because of their satisfaction with the products\u2019 quality. Striving to save\u200b The cost-of-living crisis plays a crucial role in these trends. In fact, 85% of those assessed who buy private label products do so because of price, with 48% stressing that \u2018promotions\u2019 were a factor in their choices. However, quality was also a significant part of private labels\u2019 appeal. Many found that private label products had \u2018better taste\u2019 than branded products, with 51% saying they don\u2019t see a difference in the quality of private label and branded products. Furthermore, 40% of respondents used \u2018cleaner ingredients\u2019 as a justification for a pivot towards private labels. \u201cWhile the research confirms that the price of private-label items impacts grocery shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions in the current economic climate, quality is still a crucial factor influencing consumers\u2019 buying journey\u200b,\u201d said Madalina Mitru, Strategic Marketing & Value Chain Manager at Amcor. \u201cTaste, quality, and origin are all still important when consumers are making purchasing decisions.\u201d\u200b Sustainability and locality\u200b Many consumers also expressed approval of private labels because of their \u2018local production\u2019. This was linked to concerns about sustainability, with 42% of consumers seeing products produced locally as made with greater concern around being sustainable. Furthermore, 34% of consumers said that they have seen progress in areas such as \u2018food waste reduction\u2019, \u2018less excessive packaging\u2019, and \u2018more sustainable packaging\u2019 when it comes to private label products. Packaging concerns also played a key role in consumer attitudes to private label products.

Overall, 28% of consumers stated that the sustainability of packaging drove them to buy private label products. \u201cWe see a growing shift towards eco-conscious grocery shopping for both private-label and branded products,\u201d \u200bMitru added. \u201cConsumers increasingly expect their preferred products to demonstrate how they are improving sustainability. Retailers and brands can adopt more sustainable packaging to help retain customers and demonstrate their continued commitment to driving circularity and reducing their carbon footprint\u200b.\u201d However, 35% of consumers believe that manufacturers still need to make more effort to cut down on excessive packaging, with 33% stating that more effort must be made to incorporate sustainable packaging into products.","filter_flag":1}

The European Commission (EC) announced it has taken another major step to protect the environment by adopting measures that restrict microplastics intentionally added to products under the EU chemical legislation REACH. Per the agency, the new rules will prevent the release to the environment of approximately half a million tonnes of microplastics. The measures will prohibit the sale of microplastics, products to which microplastics have been intentionally added, and products that release those microplastics when used. The EC notes that when duly justified, exceptions and transition periods for the affected parties to adjust to the new rules apply. See related: European Commission to Expedite Phasing Out of Animal Testing Definitions and Scope The adopted restriction uses a broad definition of microplastics, covering all synthetic polymer particles below 5 mm that are organic, insoluble and resist degradation. The purpose is to reduce emissions of intentional microplastics from as many products as possible. Some examples of common products in the scope of the restriction are: The granular infill material used on artificial sports surfaces \u2013 reportedly the largest source of intentional microplastics in the environment; Cosmetics where microplastics are used for multiple purposes, such as exfoliation (microbeads) or obtaining a specific texture, fragrance or color; and Detergents, fabric softeners, glitter, fertilizers, plant protection products, toys, medicines and medical devices. The EC adds that products used at industrial sites or not releasing microplastics during use are exempt from the sale ban but their manufacturers must provide instructions about how to use and dispose of the products to prevent microplastic emissions. The first measures, such as the ban on loose glitter and microbeads, will apply once the restriction enters into force \u2014 20 days after the Sept. 25, 2023 announcement. In other cases, the sales ban will apply after a longer period to give affected stakeholders the time to develop and switch to alternatives. See related: La Pink Introduces Microplastic-free Skin Care Formulations in India Cosmetic Specifications The adopted measures specify that, concerning the ban on microbeads, i.e., synthetic polymer microparticles for use as an abrasive, namely to exfoliate, polish or clean, mainly used in rinse-off cosmetic products or detergents, no transitional period was proposed, as industry was expected to have voluntarily phased out their use by 2020. For certain \"leave-on\" cosmetic products, such as makeup, lip products and nail products, per the new restriction, due to their low contribution to the overall emissions of microplastics, as well as the potentially large impact on the cosmetics industry of a ban of synthetic polymer microparticles in those products, the agency's committee for socio-economic analysis (SEAC) considered two additional measures as appropriate alternatives to the ban on the placing on the market of those products after a six-year transitional period (as proposed by the Annex XV dossier). The additional measures included either: Appropriate instructions for use and disposal, or A transitional period longer than six years. However, the measures also cite that uncertainties related to the different impacts on industry and concerning releases did not allow the agency's committee for SEAC to conclude whether either option would be more appropriate than a ban and a six-year transitional period.","filter_flag":1}

The exhibition will offer a dynamic business platform that is shaping the future of the processing and packaging industries, particularly in an industry closely impacting the environment like packaging. Food packaging currently accounts for 30-50 per cent of the total packaging industry space, according to statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Trade, leading to a strong symbiotic relationship between the two fields of food and packaging. According to German data provider Statista, the packaging sector has been growing on-year with an average rate of 15-20 per cent, in parallel with the average increase of about 10 per cent of the food and beverages market over the next four years. Statista predicts that the retail sales of packaged food is growing on-year in Vietnam, with it forecasted to grow to $18.4 billion in 2023 and become one of the fastest growing fields in Vietnam, attracting the participation of foreign business sector. After the investment and expansion of many foreign food packaging manufacturing enterprises in recent years, such as Tetra Pak, SCG Packaging, Wing Fat Printing, Meiwa Pax, and St. Johns Vietnam, the Vietnamese market continues to record the appearance of new faces. Packaging equipment multinational Sidel decided to move its headquarters from Thailand to Vietnam at the beginning of this year to take advantage of opportunities from a new market. According to East and West Asia sales director Parkpoom Praprom, Sidel had a representative office in Vietnam before 2023. \u201cBut now, all main departments have been brought to Vietnam, and Sidel also recruited more Vietnamese staff for this transformation,\u201d he said. Last year, German waste management and recycling solutions provider ALBA Group Asia also signed a $50 million cooperation agreement with VietCycle partner in Vietnam to cooperate in developing a recycling plastic processing company with capacity of 48,000 tonnes a year. The result of this joint venture is the appearance of the first largest recycled plastic factory in the north, expected to come into operation in 2024. Changes in food packaging production receive active support from the production transformation process of food businesses for green and sustainable consumer needs from customers. According to consulting company Nielsen, 86 per cent of Vietnamese consumers said they are willing to pay more for products with biological or recycled packaging. Meanwhile, the Law on Environmental Protection that took effect last year and regulates the payment of emission treatment fees, also creates a push for manufacturers to invest more in the transition to green and sustainable packaging. The game continues to be led by foreign businesses with great potential and pioneering in environmental activities. Le Thi Hong Nhi, head of Communications and Corporate Affairs at Unilever Vietnam, said, \u201cThe green transformation journey plays a nuclear role in moving towards sustainable development. We are committed to building a green value chain and have pioneered achieving net-zero emissions across the entire operating system since 2021.\u201d To date, Unilever has reduced by more than half the virgin plastic used in packaging. Nearly two-thirds of packaging is recyclable, while it has collected and processed more than 20,000 tonnes of plastic waste, improving social welfare conditions for more than 2,500 female workers in the informal collection workforce. Meanwhile, design improvements to eliminate unnecessary packaging, lower the use of virgin plastic, and replace with environmentally friendly materials helped Nestl\u00e9 Vietnam reduce nearly 2,500 tonnes of plastic packaging over the last two years. Khuat Quang Hung, head of Corporate Affairs of Nestl\u00e9 Vietnam, said that about 94 per cent of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s product packaging is designed to be recyclable and reusable. This business is also aiming to use single-layer packaging to help operate recycling in an easier manner. \u201cThere is no sanction that forces the company to do so, but we recognise our responsibility and always want to be at the forefront of transformation activities,\u201d Hung told VIR. The process of switching from paper straws to plastic straws for the Milo brand has tripled Nestl\u00e9\u2019s production costs, but reduced up to 700 tonnes of disposable plastic each year. Improving the packaging of Maggi soy sauce and bottle caps also contributes to a 10 per cent improvement in the weight of plastic used for one product, equivalent to 130 tonnes of plastic per year. LaVie, a beverage brand belonging to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s ecosystem, is also a pioneer in using PET recycled plastic. Currently, one bottle of LaVie uses 50 per cent recycled plastic. \u201cRecycling is just one step of the circular economy, the necessary condition is to have a collection system, technology and solutions suitable for all types of product packaging,\u201d Hung added. Nguyen Van Viet, chairman of the Vietnam Beer-Alcohol-Beverage Association, said that packaging technology is becoming an important challenge for the beverage industry because from 2024, manufacturers and importers will have to carry out extended producer responsibility according to the Law on Environmental Protection. \u201cBusinesses that produce and use cans and bottles all lose recycling costs. We are proposing solutions to overcome difficulties for businesses, including supporting recycling costs, especially for domestic enterprises that are behind foreign enterprises in both capital source and production scale,\u201d Viet said. He admitted that while the country is doing a good job of recycling beverage cans, there are often issues when it comes to other types of packaging recycling. \u201cThe problem in Vietnam today is not what technology to apply, but how to recycle,\u201d he said. According to Praprom from Sidel, this business wants to provide standard, sustainable packaging products, and reduce the amount of waste through simple recycling, \u201cGlass packaging products take twice the time to be transported to the factory for washing and recycling. Canned products will not need to return to the factory but can be recycled directly at the collection point,\u201d Praprom explained. Boon Teong Tee - General manager Informa Markets Vietnam Over the past few years, the food and beverage packaging industry has benefited from the development of e-commerce and the rapid spread of app-based delivery business locally, and the free trade agreements that Vietnam has participated in. The effects of social distancing in 2020-2021 have created consumer habits which rapidly spread due to the convenience it offers and has expanded the use of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) packaging. To date, we do not see this trend diminishing and in fact, it has accelerated due to its convenience element, and at the cost of more FMCG waste to be managed in the cities. This recent phenomenon has disrupted businesses and provided new opportunities for others. It has also introduced pressing needs of resource conservation through circularity practices, as Vietnam will be challenged to handle rapid FMCG waste volume increases. The urbanisation of Vietnam represents the key underlying reason, with both positive and negative effects for the environment and economy. Packaging remains one of the fastest growing sectors in the Vietnamese market, with a growth rate of 13.4 per cent per year in the 2015-2020 period. New products and technologies are expected to sustain this longer-term growth rate for the years to come. I think many market leaders are working aggressively towards creating products which generate less waste through circularity concepts that offer bigger recycling opportunities with lesser costs and simpler processes through the development of new materials and design. To acknowledge the growing importance of the drink and beverage industry, Informa Vietnam has also recently announced the launch of a dedicated exhibition focusing on new technologies and services to support the expanding drink and beverage industry. This exhibition cluster is co-located with Propak Vietnam and it is our intention to grow this sector aggressively for the expanding market. Hoang Duc Vuong - Chairman Vietnam Recycled Plastics Association The management of domestic waste in Vietnam in the past 40 years has not been properly cared for, with scrap taken to craft villages for recycling, causing pollution. For many years, waste has not been classified, leading to plastic scraps worth recycling being contaminated with unpleasant odors, and very difficult to clean. European deodorising technology will probably have to give up on waste in Vietnam if there is no waste classification. Most recyclers do not dare to use 100 per cent domestic scrap but mainly have to import scrap from abroad to ensure input. As for small recycling facilities in craft villages, the low quality of scrap is the very cause of poor quality recycled products, accompanied by secondary pollution. For businesses in this country, investment costs for recycling are very large, making competition with recycling craft villages more difficult. Classifying waste from beginning brings benefits that go beyond the development of the plastic recycling industry. Separating organic waste and recyclable waste from messy landfills is the first step to processing organic waste to make biofertiliser or animal feed and recycling less valuable waste such as nylon bags, cake shells, and candy shells. The benefits can be up to billions of dollars. I think that with the joint support of the community and international organisations, the recycling industry of Vietnam will also develop. It is because this is the path that must be taken if we want to build a circular economy, contribute to the circulation of waste, and save the cost of importing resources from abroad. Packaging provider SIG reinforces sustainability commitment in Asia Through its 25 years of sustainability journey in Asia, Switzerland-headquartered aseptic packaging solutions provider Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) has been making ambitious sustainability commitments.

As more consumers look to live their lives more sustainably\u2014including buying products that are kinder to the planet\u2014there are opportunities for brands in the mass market to answer these needs by way of packaging, ingredient procurement and process. The refills are sold in single-use sachets. The refills are sold in single-use sachets. Kenvue's Leslie Rank Kenvue's Leslie Rank NPD at Neutrogena \u2014the mass market skincare stalwart in Kenvue\u2019s stable\u2014is taking that tack. The company recently rolled out what it contends is the first powder-to-foam cleanser on the market. Neutrogena Gentle Foaming Cleanser + Concentrate marries must-have skincare performance and aesthetic needs with key sustainability attributes\u2014it is waterless and refillable.\u201cThe waterless format idea stemmed from insights that consumers are becoming more interested in sustainable and waterless products that reduce plastic waste and energy consumption. This new form offers an opportunity for Neutrogena to deliver on consumers\u2019 unmet sustainability demands without compromising the cleansing efficacy and gentleness of this product,\u201d said Leslie Rank, principal scientist, skin health product and process innovation at Kenvue. (Kenvue is the standalone consumer health business spun off from Johnson & Johnson.)Users fill the Neutrogena reusable bottle with warm water and then add the concentrate.\u201cThe concentrate is a powder form that once added to water, turns into a foamy formula. When pumped out, consumers can expect a handful of cushiony foam,\u201d said Rank, who noted that it is important to shake the bottle well before first use.When the cleanser is finished, consumers fill it with more water and another concentrate refill that comes in a small sachet \u201cfor a reusable daily face wash solution,\u201d she said.Rank contends Neutrogena\u2019s consumers are ready for a refillable product.\u201cI think people are genuinely interested in investing in products that are not only gentle and respectful to the environment, but also their skin,\u201d she said.The Neutrogena R&D team created a compact formula; it has just seven ingredients\u2014Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Benzoate, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Ascorbic Acid.\u201cWe worked diligently to create a formula with only seven ingredients to gently wash away dirt and impurities, while still leaving skin feeling refreshed and replenished,\u201d said Rank. \u201cWe also ensured our formula was compatible with a sustainable packaging format that could deliver a soft, cushiony foam to give a comforting sensory experience.\u201dIn addition, it is 96% biodegradable, unscented, non-comedogenic and free of parabens, phthalates, sulfate-surfactants, alcohol, mineral oil and soap, noted Rank.According to Rank, Neutrogena continues to explore new packaging that reduces plastic usage.\u201cIn fact, we\u2019re starting to begin work to investigate packaging increases the use of PCR plastic (post-consumer recycled) and sustainable pumps. These are in the early stages, but we always are looking for solutions that provide more eco-friendly packaging without compromising consumer\u2019s skincare needs of gentle and effective solutions,\u201d she told Happi.The new cleanser can be purchased at Target.com , Walmart.com and Rite Aid.com","filter_flag":1}

The new yoghurt pouch is created using Dow\u2019s proprietary INNATE TF-BOPE resins, which enable the replacement of PET or BOPA in laminated film to achieve mono-material packaging. \u201cThe INNATE TF-BOPE resins deliver excellent toughness and printing performance, while still being aesthetically pleasing and functionally protective. Mono-material packaging, when recycled via appropriate mechanical recycling technologies, can be reused as high-quality PCR resins with increased value and versatility across different applications,\u201d \u200bsaid Jayne Wong, Senior Group Marketing Director at Dow. Environmental-friendly manufacturing is an important pillar of Mengniu\u2019s sustainability strategy, and adopting low-carbon packaging in all product lines is a significant part of it. The firm has set a goal to achieve 100% technically recyclable packaging by 2025. \u201cAlthough sustainability is a relatively new concept for Chinese consumers, it has been gaining popularity due to the implementation of improvements in national standards, the support of corporations, and increasing eco-consciousness among the people. As a result, green consumption has become a rising trend in China.\u200b \u201cWe are always searching for ways to make dairy packaging more recyclable. Many of our products have obtained the \u2018Double Easy\u2019 certification recognised by T\u00dcV Rheinland. The newly launched yogurt packaging empowered by Dow\u2019s solution is another remarkable achievement,\u201d \u200bLin elaborated. On the same note, Wong shared that sustainable development is no longer a priority just for international brands, and that Chinese companies are increasingly taking action to promote the widespread use of sustainable packaging. \u201cMengniu serves as a prime example of this commitment to sustainability. From the consumer perspective, it calls for brand owners to close the loop on packaging waste, and for the industry at large to design for recyclability.\u201d \u200b Sustainability strategies\u200b In 2021, Mengniu introduced a sustainable development strategy called GREEN, which focuses on five pillars: sustainable corporate governance, prosperity for all in the dairy industry, environmentally friendly production, responsible industry ecosystems, and nutritionally excellent products. The firm follows The Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Golden Design Rules and has developed various \u201cgreen products\u201d that use sustainable packaging, including Future Star Milk and Youyi C drinks. \u201cAs a large dairy company operating in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, we are committed to sustainable practices and aspire to champion green consumption.\u200b \u201cOur industrial chain is extensive, ranging from pasture management and product processing to packaging and transportation. Each chain link presents sustainability challenges and opportunities for a green transformation,\u201d \u200bsaid Lin. At the same time, Mengniu seeks to have more engagement with consumers, and to partner with \u201cinnovation experts\u201d like Dow to apply advanced technologies in production processes. \u201cInteracting with customers is vital for developing eco-conscious products and educating them about responsible consumption. Enhancing consumer eco-consciousness will significantly boost sustainable development in the dairy industry.\u200b \u201cFurthermore, government policies and industry standards must work hand in hand. Besides collaborating on product R&D, brand owners and manufacturers must also step up, and advocate for the creation of relevant policies and standards. This will provide guidance for sustainable practices, allowing them to flourish and progress,\u201d \u200bLin added. Similarly, Dow believes that the packaging value chain should continue to collaborate with related government departments and organisations, such as Alliance to End Plastic Waste, to develop and commercialise more recyclable packaging. The company has also set new targets around advancing a circular economy and climate protection by focusing on reducing carbon emissions and eliminating plastic waste. Through its Pack Studios, where businesses in the materials science, machinery, and converting industries as well as brand owners can communicate and collaborate closely, Dow aims to facilitate the acceleration of sustainable packaging development.","filter_flag":1}

Promotions were highlighted as the second biggest factor in determining a consumer\u2019s decision to purchase private label items, mentioned by 48% of respondents. Of those that have sought out own brand products due to their lower price point, 51% said they will continue to buy them due to their quality. When discussing what determines the quality of a product, the most common answers were \u2018better taste\u2019, \u2018local production\u2019 and \u2018cleaner ingredients\u2019. Sustainability and packaging concerns also influence consumer behaviour and the likelihood they will purchase private label products. More than 40% believe that efforts have been made to improve the sustainability of own brand products and 34% said they have seen progress in reducing food waste. A third felt that more sustainable packaging has become more common, while 28% stated that more sustainable packaging influenced their decision to buy private label products. However, 35% answered that less excessive packaging should be used. Quality still important to demand Strategic marketing and value chain manager at Amcor, Madalina Mitru, said that despite concerns around price and sustainability, the quality of own brand items was a \u201ccrucial factor\u200b\u201d in their success. Mitru explained: \u201cTaste, quality, and origin are all still important when consumers are making purchasing decisions\u200b. Furthermore, over half of [respondents] said they perceive no difference in the quality of private-label products versus branded ones, putting private-label brands in a strong position for the future\u200b.\u201d According to Mitru, the results also show that consumers increasingly expect both private label and brand products to be produced and packaged sustainably. \u201cRetailers and brands can adopt more sustainable packaging to help retain customers and demonstrate their continued commitment to driving circularity and reducing their carbon footprint\u200b,\u201d she said.

Their objective is to ensure all flexible packaging is optimized for collection, sorting and recycling \u2013 and producing higher quality recycled materials to be used again in the circular economy. To help facilitate their use, CEFLEX has teamed up with recyclability experts Recyda to deliver design-check.ceflex.eu. This free service has been extensively beta-tested by CEFLEX stakeholders and is now being made available for anyone wanting to make a quick and effective assessment on their design journey. The \u2018Design Check\u2019 tool was developed in response to users of the guidelines who requested a way to check if a packaging design or specification adheres to them when assessing their packaging portfolios and developing new products with partners, suppliers and customers. \u201cThe tool can be used either to assess an existing package, facilitate the R&D and design process, engage with other parts of the value chain, or prepare for recyclability testing,\u201d explained CEFLEX design lead Liz Morrish. \u201cA team of CEFLEX stakeholders developed and tested the tool \u2013 including confidentiality and data protection elements \u2013 and many stakeholder companies have already used it successfully.\u201d \u201cAssessment covers all parts of the guidelines, including their sortability and recyclability principles.

The environmental impact and recyclability of each project is assessed. As a result, DTS Europe offers the market a complete and varied range of mono-material and 100% recyclable products. Cosmetic products formulations and sustainability We associate sustainable formulations with organic or natural ingredients. Natural formulas are usually quite challenging as they contain active ingredients and no preservatives. In most cases, this type of formula requires an airless system that doesn\u2019t oxidise the formula and protects it until it comes into contact with the skin. Is it easy to find airless packaging? Yes. Is it easy to find sustainable airless packaging? No! DTS Europe Mono-material Airless Systems and Packaging DTS Europe allows cosmetics brands to choose and develop natural formulations and to choose sustainable packaging for these formulations. The European company based in Portugal develops sustainable packaging (100% mono-material and 100% recyclable) that can transport these formulations to the consumer. Mono-material packaging plays a fundamental role in the entire sustainability chain and in the circular economy, enabling easy recycling by the end-consumer and recyclability in the recycling industries (reducing the amount of resin to just one), allowing for collection, sorting, separation and recycling within European levels. The packaging produced by DTS Europe has all the necessary characteristics that guarantee the quality of the material after recycling, generating a high quality PCR, fully integrated into the circular economy. A sustainable range DTS Europe\u2019s niche portfolio includes a wide range of sustainable and elegant packaging capable of integrating any skincare and make-up product line. The range consists of flexible packaging available in more than 5 diameters and filling capacities ranging from 8ml to 90ml. Taking another step forward in the design of mono-material packaging, DTS Europe has just launched the innovative Pump Pacific - 100% recyclable and 100% made of PE - a solution that is easy to separate and easily integrated into any skincare or make-up line. Innovation and the Future The next few years will be marked by major innovations that will revolutionise sustainable packaging. They will also be years in which DTS Europe will launch the \"Local Communities\" project where it will work together with its communities to reduce their carbon footprint and encourage them to have a more sustainable footprint.","filter_flag":1}
