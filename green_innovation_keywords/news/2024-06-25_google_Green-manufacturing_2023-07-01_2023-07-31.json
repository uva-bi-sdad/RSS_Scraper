Those items are typically found in traditional brick-and-mortar stores such as Ace, Home Depot, Kroger, Staples, Target, Walgreens and Wal-Mart, as well as Amazon and other online websites. Supply chain lessons learned during the coronavirus pandemic have spurred demand for products labeled \u201cMade in USA.\u201d In fact, the Alliance of American Manufacturing (AAM) claims that 75 percent of American consumers would prefer to purchase items that are made in the United States. However, one-third say they rarely or never see America-made products while shopping. Many consumers want to buy products that are made in the United States. Photo courtesy Home Depot Inc. \u201cAmericans want to shop Made in USA,\u201d claims Scott Paul, AAM\u2019s president. \u201cRetailers are missing out by not doing more to promote American-made [products] in their marketing and store displays. I am truly optimistic that the United States can still do big things, and that includes building a Made in America future.\u201d \u201cToday, more manufacturers are reevaluating where they assemble products, because of the risk of losing China and Taiwan as a supply source due to recent adversarial conditions,\u201d adds Harry Moser, founder and president of the Reshoring Initiative. \u201cDestabilizing geopolitical and climate forces have brought to light supply chain vulnerabilities and the need to address them. \u201cCOVID also was a wake-up call to American manufacturers and consumers,\u201d explains Moser, author of ASSEMBLY\u2019s \u201cMoser on Manufacturing\u201d column. \u201cIt opened their eyes and made them more sensitive to the risk or probability of disruption.\u201d Consumer Goods Are Different Most consumer products are different than other types of mass-produced items such as cars, appliances, medical devices or furniture. \u201cThere are many unique aspects about manufacturing consumer goods that need to be taken into consideration, starting with the product\u2019s form factor,\u201d says Jeff Cavanaugh, senior vice president of global business units at Jabil Inc., a contract manufacturer that works with a variety of companies in different industries. \u201cMany consumer products represent small form factors manufactured in large volumes, with millions of units produced annually. \u201cFor that reason, consumer products often are manufactured in centralized locations, mostly in China or other parts of Asia, and then shipped to the rest of the world at low cost from a logistics standpoint,\u201d explains Cavanaugh. \u201cThe production of larger consumer goods, however, such as refrigerators, washers and dryers, typically is regionalized, driven in part by the costs of final assembly and distribution. \u201cAnother important distinction is the reality of shorter product lifecycles, with 12- to 24-month refresh rates and continuous competitive pressures that accelerate product design, development and delivery,\u201d Cavanaugh points out. \u201cConsumer goods companies must move with speed and agility in bringing products to market, which includes ramping production volumes to maximize capacity, while optimizing productivity and efficiency. Consumer goods manufacturers must move with speed and agility to bring new products to market. Photo courtesy Target Corp. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on new product introduction, as every opportunity to expedite the path to commercialization requires seamless collaboration with manufacturing partners to reduce complexities through the use of best-practices and proven processes,\u201d adds Cavanaugh. As a result, digital manufacturing technology is becoming increasingly critical as companies seek to leverage automated production, improve quality and increase value, while lowering production costs. According to a recent McKinsey & Co analysis, automation, digitization and the drive for greater sustainability are changing the way that American manufacturers assemble their products. These factors are also encouraging CEOs to take a fresh look at where manufacturing is done. For companies that supply U.S. markets, the evolution of factor costs has significantly eroded the comparative advantage of global production locations and supplier networks. When organizations expand their definition of value to take account of sustainability issues and supply chain risks, the gap can narrow even further. Benefits of Domestic Production Making consumer goods in the U.S. makes sense for some manufacturers. One of the biggest advantages is the ability to respond quickly. Companies can adjust swiftly to issues that may arise regarding production schedules, supply chain issues or staffing changes. \u201cResponding to a supply chain crisis quickly can save a company millions of dollars,\u201d says Izzy Galicia, president and CEO of the Incito Consulting Group. \u201cIn addition, having employees close by to handle a problem can\u2019t be understated. \u201cYou are also able to get a product to market quicker,\u201d notes Galicia. \u201cOffshore production can lead to delays that eventually will be costly. While it might be cheaper to sometimes produce overseas, the potential for more problems does arise because of location and how long it may take to solve a supply chain issue.\u201d \u201cWhen manufacturers produce consumer goods in the U.S., they have complete control over their supply chain,\u201d adds Ryan McMartin, product marketing manager at Parsec Automation Corp. \u201c[It] means not having to worry about trans-ocean shipping costs, currency exchange rates, tariffs or international trade agreements. \u201cAnother benefit is related to basic geographic simplicity,\u201d says McMartin. \u201cIt takes far less time to procure materials when you operate within U.S. borders. This relative logistical ease also means manufacturers don\u2019t have to carry as much inventory. With faster delivery and just-in-time fulfillment, manufacturers gain the tremendous benefit of nimbler operations. \u201cWe have seen an increased push for domestic production and Made in USA consumer goods,\u201d claims McMartin. \u201cAmerican consumers tend to embody a sense of supporting the little guy when it comes to manufactured goods. \u201cWhen you consider the escalating political climate around China and Russia, it\u2019s easy to see why Americans may have a sense of national pride and a preference for shopping locally,\u201d McMartin points out. \u201cGeopolitical factors aside, I think the Covid-19 pandemic also encouraged consumers to support domestic businesses with more of a homegrown story, even if it means paying slightly more.\u201d Domestic production enables manufacturers to respond quickly to customer needs. Photo courtesy Gordon Brush Co. What Does \u2018Made in USA\u2019 Mean? Designating a product \u201cMade in USA\u201d involves more than just slapping a sticker of an American flag on a package. In fact, what constitutes the claim is somewhat confusing and subject to debate. There\u2019s no law that requires most products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about the amount of U.S. content that they contain. However, manufacturers that choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with rules and policy adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC monitors and enforces various claims, with violators subject to large fines. Its most recent Made in USA Labeling Rule went into effect Aug. 13, 2021. Traditionally, the FTC has required that a product advertised as Made in USA be \u201call or virtually all\u201d made in the United States. \u201cAll or virtually all\u201d means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no\u2014or negligible\u2014foreign content. When a manufacturer makes an unqualified claim that a product is \u201cMade in USA,\u201d it should have \u201creasonable basis\u201d to support the claim at the time it is made. This means the company needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \u201call or virtually all\u201d made in the United States. When claiming a product is assembled in the U.S., manufacturers should be able to prove that the item is \u201csubstantially transformed in the U.S., its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and U.S. assembly operations are substantial.\u201d The product\u2019s final assembly or processing must take place in the United States. The FTC then considers other factors, including how much of the product\u2019s total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product\u2019s overall processing. A product that includes foreign components may be called \u201cAssembled in USA\u201d without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \u201cassembly\u201d claim to be valid, the product\u2019s last \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d also should have occurred in the United States. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) has introduced bipartisan legislation to fix outdated labeling laws to inform Americans shopping online about where products are made, and to help U.S. manufacturers selling their goods through online retailers. \u201cRegardless of whether shopping online or in a store, Americans have a right to know whether the products they buy are being made right here in America, by American workers,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cWith more and more consumers buying their goods online, we must ensure online retailers are being just as transparent as brick-and-mortar stores.\u201d \u2018Locking\u2019 In Customers Pacific Lock Co. (Paclock) is a family-owned firm based in Valencia, CA, that specializes in padlocks. It produces multiple types of locks that are used to secure everything from garden sheds to gates and job boxes to trailer doors. Paclock\u2019s customers include homeowners, locksmiths and the U.S. military, plus leading manufacturers such as Boeing and Mercedes-Benz. Products are available in a variety of shapes and sizes for numerous light-and heavy-duty applications. The company also produces padlocks out of several materials, such as aluminum, brass and stainless steel. Options include traditional solid and laminated body padlocks, plus hidden shackle and hockey puck-style locks. Other variations include cylinder type, shackle diameter and shackle height. While most of Paclock\u2019s products are marketed through distributors, it has also sold padlocks in traditional retail settings, such as Home Depot, and online retailers such as Amazon. The company sells direct to large commercial customers like Disney and the U.S. Army. \u201cOur manufacturing capabilities allow us to manage and successfully produce large volumes,\u201d says Greg Waugh, president and CEO of Paclock. \u201cAs the exclusive supplier of padlocks to Public Storage, for instance, we have delivered millions of the world\u2019s best disc padlock without a single return for defects, while maintaining a near 100 percent on-time delivery rate. This retail display encourages consumers to purchase padlocks that are manufactured domestically. Photo courtesy Pacific Lock Co. \u201cWe engineer, machine, assemble and test a majority of our product line in the United States, which is our key differentiating factor,\u201d explains Waugh. \u201cBecause we manufacture in the U.S., we can control quality, production capacity and quickly develop new, innovative products in a matter of weeks, not months or years.\" According to Waugh, that gives his company a unique advantage vs. larger firms that dominate the market. \u201cOur biggest competitor makes components in the U.S., but does final assembly in Mexico,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen I first joined the company in 2005, all of our components were made overseas. Since then, we\u2019ve steadily onshored production. But, we\u2019ve always done all of our assembly here. \u201cWe have to use a few components that come from overseas, such as shackles and cylinders, because of cost,\u201d laments Waugh. \u201cThat\u2019s why our packaging says \u2018Made in USA with global components.\u2019 \u201cWe are limited by certain price points in the market,\u201d Waugh points out. \u201cBut, as we continue to develop more expensive, value-added products, we continue looking for ways to make more components domestically. We recently received a U.S. government contract for a high-security padlock, so we make its cylinder here. \u201cInnovation and quality are two of the biggest advantages of making products domestically,\u201d claims Waugh. \u201cBy producing in the states, we can control our lead times. However, there\u2019s also a lot of pride in U.S. manufacturing. That\u2019s why we include an American flag on all of our packaging. \u201cProducing the bulk of our products here gives us the ability to make small runs of new items to solve unique customer problems without taking a big risk,\u201d says Waugh. \u201cThere are a lot of unique needs that we cater to. For instance, we make custom padlocks for Disney World. \"Our competitors typically require at least a year to introduce a new product,\u201d claims Waugh. \u201cIn contrast, we can have a new item ready to go in just a few weeks.\u201d High quality goes hand in hand with a domestic production strategy. Photo courtesy Pacific Lock Co. High quality also goes hand in hand with Paclock\u2019s domestic production strategy. \u201cWe control quality,\u201d explains Waugh. \u201cOther lock manufacturers outsource production and pay Chinese or Taiwanese factories to make their products. \u201cIn addition, our proprietary machining practices give us unprecedented manufacturing flexibility that leads to short runs, fast turnaround times, almost zero waste and cost savings,\u201d claims Waugh. \u201cWe use American-made Haas Automation CNC machines to produce lock bodies, the most important component of a padlock. That enables us to maintain a 0.003-inch tolerance on all of our machining operations. \u201cTo succeed, we have to be a jack of all trades,\u201d says Waugh. \u201cIf a customer wants something unique, such as a custom color or a special engraving, we\u2019ll find a way to make it. \u201cThe only bad things about making products in the U.S. is the fact that finding skilled and competent workers is far more challenging today than it was in the past,\u201d adds Waugh. \u201cRegulations enforced by EPA and OSHA also make it challenging for domestic manufacturers to thrive. For instance, it\u2019s becoming harder to find local vendors that specialize in anodizing and plating. With less competition out there, prices go up.\u201d The \u2018Write\u2019 Way to Manufacture The Pen Company of America (PCA) is another family-owned firm that\u2019s bullish on domestic manufacturing. The Garwood, NJ, company has been in business since 1928. Today, it mass-produces a wide variety of writing instruments, including pens and industrial markers, in a 50,000-square-foot factory that\u2019s highly automated. \u201cWe have never manufactured products outside the United States,\u201d claims Colleen Shea, vice president of sales at PCA, who runs the company along with her father and two brothers. Automation enables U.S. manufacturers to go head to head with offshore competition. Photo courtesy Pen Company of America \u201cAs a fourth-generation writing instrument manufacturer, we have always worked hard to keep all our production domestic,\u201d explains Shea. \u201cMany of our pens are customized for the promotional industry. \u201cIn that arena, we are the only manufacturer whose entire line of metal and plastic pens is domestically made,\u201d explains Shea. \u201cWhile others moved offshore over the last few decades, we have dedicated our time, energy and resources to find creative ways to keep manufacturing in America.\u201d The company produces around 30 different styles of pens and markers. In addition, it makes internal metal components for other companies, such as Fisher Space Pen Co., which assembles its specialty products in Boulder City, NV. PCA also molds plastic parts that a medical device firm uses to produce surgical skin markers. \u201cThe majority of our business involves custom-made pens that are used for promotional purposes,\u201d says Shea. \u201cThey contain unique customer names, logos, colors and designs. We supply everyone from large banks to small mom-and-pop coffee shops. \u201cWe are vertically integrated,\u201d Shea points out. \u201cWe do all of our plastic-injection molding in-house, in addition to making the metal writing cartridges. We also do all printing, laser engraving and decorating ourselves. We even make our own springs, and we produce our own heat-transfer film, which is used for decorating pen barrels.\u201d PCA operates three assembly lines that mass-produce an average of 30,000 pens a shift or as many as 300,000 units a week. \u201cAll our metal pens have \u2018USA\u2019 embossed in them,\u201d says Shea. \u201cAll our plastic pens have \u2018USA\u2019 molded into them. Our standard, gift and executive boxes all indicate \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019 Even the boxes themselves are made domestically.\u201d A typical plastic pen consists of six main components, including the barrel, writing cartridge, a plunger and ratchet mechanism, a spring, a tip and a clip. Metal pens are more complex and contain up to 14 components. \u201cAll of our production processes are automated, including robots for assembly and pick-and-place applications,\u201d says Shea. \u201cAutomation plays an important role in keeping our pricing stable and constant. That\u2019s the only way we can compete with imported products. The writing instrument industry is very competitive, because pens are a commodity product. Photo courtesy Pen Company of America \u201cThe writing instrument industry is very competitive, because pens are a commodity product,\u201d explains Shea. \u201cWe pride ourselves on high quality and fast delivery times. \u201cA lot of metal pen companies have moved production offshore, including our biggest competitor,\u201d notes Shea. \u201cUnlike those companies, most of our products are delivered within seven to 10 business days. \u201cAnother thing that sets us apart is customer service,\u201d claims Shea. \u201cMany small companies in our industry have been bought up by larger firms that moved customer service offshore. We are more nimble and have a definite advantage in that regard. \u201cWith domestic production, we can react quickly to customers\u2019 needs,\u201d says Shea. \u201cWhen a customer needs 100,000 custom pens in a few weeks or a specially molded pen, we have the ability to fulfill these orders much quicker than the imported products. The disruption in the supply chain over the past several years has given us a unique competitive advantage. To succeed, domestic consumer products manufacturers must excel at customer service, delivery and quality. Photo courtesy Pen Company of America \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult for us to compete against offshore manufacturers,\u201d adds Shea. \u201cEven if we\u2019re a little more expensive, we excel at customer service, delivery and quality. However, we have to be creative and stay one step ahead in terms of finding ways to improve our costs. \u201cOverall, this is a good time to be an American manufacturer, because the COVID pandemic exposed a lot of supply chain gaps and deficiencies,\u201d concludes Shea. \u201cWe have seen a resurgence and appreciation for U.S. manufacturing.\u201d \u2018Brushing\u2019 Away the Competition Gordon Brush Manufacturing Co. is another firm that\u2019s proud of its Made in USA business philosophy. The company has a rich heritage as an American manufacturer of brooms and brushes. In fact, two of its 12 brands date back to 1855 and 1897. Gordon has even trademarked the term \u201cProud to be an American Manufacturer.\u201d Today, the company mass-produces more than 17,000 standard and specialty items. Gordon\u2019s diverse customer base includes NASA and the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, plus artists, bakers, chimney sweeps, doctors and janitors. Its products are used to clean everything from accordions to zoos and tanks to telescopes. Gordon\u2019s extensive product list includes brooms and brushes made out of a wide variety of materials, such as natural fibers, synthetic fibers and wire. Handles are made out of metal, plastic and wood. \u201cAs the demand for American-made products increases, we are proud to be at the forefront of that movement,\u201d says Ken Rakusin, president and CEO of Gordon Brush Manufacturing Co. \u201cWe never offshored anything and are proud that we\u2019ve been able to dramatically grow over our 72 years in business. Finding skilled and competent workers is far more challenging today than it was in the past. Photo courtesy Pacific Lock Co. \u201cWe are dedicated to maintaining American jobs and continuing the tradition of great American manufacturers, while creating the highest quality [products],\u201d Rakusin points out. \u201cOther than a small amount of hand assembly that is done by our team of people in Mexico, we never explored moving production overseas. We value our American employees and never have had a situation where we would have needed to terminate them because we tried to save a buck.\u201d Most of Gordon\u2019s products are manufactured in a state-of-the-art 183,000-square-foot factory in City of Industry, CA, that is ISO 9001:2015 certified. The company also operates a 66,000-square-foot factory in Hattiesburg, MS, that mass-produces brushes for automotive and marine applications. In addition, Gordon recently acquired Justman Brush Co. and its 45,000-square-foot facility in Omaha, NE. \u201cThe last several years have been a challenge, especially sourcing raw materials and labor,\u201d says Rakusin. \u201cFor a while during the pandemic, our lead times [doubled], but things are much better now. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested and are investing millions of dollars in new equipment to make us more efficient and productive,\u201d explains Rakusin. \u201cIt seems like the more we invest, the more our business grows and the more people we need. \u201cWe continue to invest a significant amount in new machinery and we have a couple of machines that use robotics,\u201d adds Rakusin. \u201cOur diverse product offering makes it challenging in most areas to have automated production lines, so we tend to invest in better, faster equipment. \u201cOur products are [primarily] not sold in a retail environment, so packaging isn\u2019t critical,\u201d notes Rakusin. \u201cHowever, labels state that our products are \u2018Made in the USA with global materials,\u2019 as many of our raw materials are not available in the states.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

In April, the German carmaker announced that it will head up a new project to explore the circular economy in automotive manufacturing. BMW is joining forces with representatives from the recycling industry, commodity processors and academia to work on ways to improve the quality of secondary raw materials obtained from recycling end-of-life vehicles. Backed by $7 million from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action in Germany, the Car2Car project will focus specifically on improving the quality and availability of recycled aluminum, steel, glass, copper and plastic. In the future, innovative dismantling and automated sorting methods will generate far greater quantities of these resources to be recovered from end-of-life vehicles than has so far been the case. This project also includes an end-to-end evaluation of both the ecological and economic impacts of closed-loop recycling of these materials. \u201cThe successful transformation of vehicle manufacturers and suppliers is crucial for Germany as a business location,\u201d says Michael Kellner, parliamentary state secretary at Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. \u201cA stronger circular economy that conserves and reuses resources is a key step towards climate neutrality and safeguards supply chains at the same time. [The goal is] to make the automotive industry less dependent on raw material imports and ensure a long-term supply of raw materials for the economy, thereby boosting industrial value creation.\u201d BMW has set a goal of increasing the proportion of secondary materials in its brands\u2019 new models from around 30 percent to 50 percent. To help achieve this, the recyclability of materials is taken into account during the design process for new models. Rethinking how materials are recovered from vehicles at the end of their life is also important. The raw materials obtained from recycling can only be used if they also satisfy the carmaker\u2019s quality standards. The BMW Group is supplying 500 end-of-life vehicles for the project, including BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles. Vehicles with combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and all-electric drive units will be recycled to produce a representative spectrum of materials. Consortium partners will look for ways to improve the quality and quantity of the recovered materials. The consortium is working out the optimum balance between the dismantling process and post-shredder technologies from a qualitative, economic and ecological perspective to retain as much of the value initially invested in the manufacturing of a car as possible. Today\u2019s recycling processes involve a high degree of manual effort and result in a loss of material purity, meaning they are only economically viable for a small number of vehicle components. The Car2Car project hopes to improve on that. Digital technology and artificial intelligence will be used to automate and speed up recycling processes that have previously been performed manually. For instance, the dismantling process could be partly or even highly automated with the help of robotics. Vision systems, assisted by AI, could be used to sort reusable materials after shredding, thereby improving the quality and purity of aluminum, steel, glass, copper and plastic materials. To achieve this, the consortium will need to develop new technologies, such as AI-enhanced spectroscopy, that can identify different steel and aluminum alloys. This will enable suppliers to obtain raw materials with a higher degree of purity, so less processing work will be required to turn scrap into reusable raw materials. BMW is also leading another consortium project called Future Sustainable Car Materials (FSCM). Under its lead, research institutes and companies are working together on innovative process routes and material concepts for sustainable use of secondary materials and for reducing the carbon footprint of raw materials such as steel and aluminum. The use of secondary aluminum is a prime example of how consistent use of recycled material can cut greenhouse gas emissions. BMW is also carrying out important groundwork when it comes to the actual recycling of vehicles at the end of their life. The company is the only carmaker to run its own recycling center, which has been in operation since 1994. Up to 10,000 vehicles a year are processed at the Recycling and Dismantling Centre in Unterschlei\u00dfheim near Munich. We hope manufacturers in other industries are inspired by BMW\u2019s efforts. Assemblers of many large, complex products, such as white goods, tractors and aircraft, could certainly benefit from a more circular economy.","filter_flag":1}

The United Nations Global Compact echoed this sentiment, and even the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) confirms that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by nearly 90 percent since 1970, much to the detriment of the global community. We can halt this rapid advancement of environmental and social degradation with sustainable supply chain practices. A sustainable supply chain can be defined as one that employs environmentally and socially sustainable practices across the entire gamut of the supply chain process. These environmental and socially sustainable practices are done with the intention of cutting down carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other air pollutants that are the primary greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming, thereby protecting people and the environment. Use of more efficient packaging allows manufacturers to layer more products onto one another, thereby reducing costs, improving supply chain efficiency, and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions The depletion of resources, deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, water security pollution, and loss of biological diversity all contribute to a shortfall in the ecological balance, so companies must, as a matter of necessity, develop ethical, logistical processes that ensure the environment is sustained. A company\u2019s supply chain practices must incorporate environmentally ethical practices such as green purchasing, green manufacturing, green warehousing, green packaging, and green transportation. A significant portion of sustainable supply chain practices are based on sustainable environmental practices. However, social standards are also integral to sustainable supply chain practices. These social standards cover issues such as forced labour, health and safety conditions, working conditions, and fair labour practices. Consequently, a comprehensive sustainable supply chain should include a process that yields immense environmental benefits as well as long-term benefits for workers and communities. Ecological and socially responsible supply chain practices Let\u2019s look at some environmentally and socially sustainable supply chain practices that companies and other critical stakeholders may employ in the supply chain. 1. Rethinking intricate material components Material components are all the inputs a company uses to create and deliver its product in a supply chain lifecycle. A fair assessment of material components includes both human and material efforts. In a supply chain process, raw materials and energy expenditure can all be classified as \u201cmaterial components.\u201d Companies can shift towards sustainable supply chain practices by revamping the material components they employ in the supply chain process. For instance, the office supply retailer, Staples, saved $3 million in fuel annually simply by directing its drivers to drive more slowly. It was eventually realized that by limiting the company\u2019s delivery speed to sixty miles per hour, Staples reduced its transport fleet\u2019s fuel consumption from 8.5 miles per gallon (mpg) to 10.4 miles per gallon, thereby utilizing 20 percent less fuel in the supply chain process and altogether reducing its CO2 emissions. Seemingly \u2018little\u2019 tweaks like the one from Staples have therefore shown that companies can rethink the components of their supply chain inputs, altogether reducing their carbon footprints and incorporating sustainable supply chain processes. 2) Using recycled materials to reduce plastic pollution A significant detriment to environmental sustainability is plastic pollution. Scientists confirm that excessive plastic in the global environment can result in \u201cplastic bio-accumulation.\u201d Sorely, about 8 million plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations every year. Meanwhile, plastic production is expected to double by 2050, having crossed more than 448 million tons by 2015. Using recycled materials during the supply chain process can significantly reduce the plastic footprint in the global environment. Manufacturers can reprocess plastic and other materials like steel, glass, and cardboard. The advantages of recycled materials are cross-cutting. Recycled materials do not only save energy\u2014since recycling materials \u200crequire less energy than refining petroleum into virgin plastic, crushing and smelting iron ores, or transforming pulp wood into cardboard\u2014they also save money. Supply chain enthusiasts have noted that it is now possible to convert waste plastic into \u201c3D printing filament\u201d, a product manufacturers can use to create new products at a lower cost than plastic. 3) Improving product packaging Closely related to the urgent need to reduce overall plastic footprint is the imperative for manufacturers to streamline and improve their product\u2019s packaging as they carry out the supply chain process. It is possible to save manufacturers money and benefit the environment by switching to streamlined packaging that uses fewer materials. The use of more efficient packaging allows manufacturers to layer more products onto one another, thereby reducing costs, improving supply chain efficiency, and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Streamlined packaging can also lead to significant improvements in supply chain efficiency. In effect, streamlined packaging can help manufacturers reduce transport costs, optimize inventory management, improve customer experience, enhance sustainability efforts, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. 4) Communicating sustainable supply chain initiatives to consumers Manufacturers must not think that customers are not emotionally invested in a sustainable supply chain process. A Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey found that 70 percent of customers are willing to pay a 5 percent price premium for sustainable goods. The US Small Business Association also found that four in five consumers buy environmentally friendly products and services. Manufacturers must inform customers about their sustainable supply chain initiatives in order to achieve this goal. As a result of this extended PR campaign, customers, communities, and manufacturers can build a self-fulfilling loop in which they can maintain the trust of their customers that products are environmentally friendly and that their business objectives are aligned with the environment. Conclusion A sustainable supply chain is achieved through a variety of means and methods, both from an environmental and social perspective. Nevertheless, manufacturers must take responsibility for ensuring the environmental safety of the products that arrive through the supply chain process since the goal is to balance profitability with sustainability.","filter_flag":1}

With festivities around the corner, there has been a significant surge in demand in the markets which are flooded with consumers. Every industry is witnessing the surge, and Beauty and Personal Care is not behind. However, the stiff competition for customers between online and offline brands has become more prominent than ever. To understand the commotion among the brands this season, these brands give us an insight into their 2022 journey and their 2023 growth plans. SUGAR Cosmetics This year SUGAR Cosmetics touched larger milestones, becoming one of the select few brands that have launched 120+ of their own stores in retail, reaching a total of 45000+ retail touchpoints across 550+ cities. SUGAR\u2019s IG page garnered 2.4M+ followers, becoming the largest consumer brand in India on the platform, along with our experiment into gamified AR filters that hit virality on platforms like Instagram and Moj. The brand\u2019s #ShukarHaiSUGARHai Campaign with campaign ambassadors Ranveer Singh and Tamannaah Bhatia was also a huge viral success allowing the brand to receive support from impactful investors namely LCatterton and Ranveer Singh. \u201cAt SUGAR in 2022, we managed to almost double our sales over the previous year, achieved the target of being one of the Top 3 brands in color cosmetics in India, and are looking at another year of massive growth,\u201d said Vineeta Singh, Co-founder, and CEO, SUGAR Cosmetics. She further added, \u201cOur plans for 2023 include targeting and achieving a 100 percent Y-O-Y revenue growth over last year, expansion to more than 60,000 retail outlets, making our D2C platform base stronger and larger, and growing our team size to 3,000 employees.\u201d Keeping its audience in mind, SUGAR is looking forward to tapping into different categories of the beauty industry. The brand will also focus on creating solid content to keep educating and engaging its community across all platforms\u2013digital and others. The Body Shop \"We at The Body Shop are embarking upon a new strategy of \u2018Change Making Beauty\u2019, which means that we aim to empower customers, employees, and partners to drive positive change for the world through our channels, our products, and our activism,\" stated Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, South Asia. With this vision, the brand is aligned to reach its goal of 25 new stores in 2022 at various locations. Currently, having 200 highly visible and accessible stores all over India, including Tier I and II cities, with the latest additions in Itanagar, Surat, and Indore. The brand's current product portfolio is already over 60 percent Vegan, aiming to become 100 percent Vegan by 2023. This aim is the natural next step forward for the brand's Cruelty-Free commitment, including reformulating all our core products from 100 percent Vegetarian to 100 percent Vegan, while focusing on making its product packaging 100 percent recyclable thus reducing its environmental impact. \"We are strengthening our retail and e-commerce channels by opening more workshop stores and launching new digital experiences. We are expanding our retail footprint with a clear focus on smaller cities and towns. Rolling out the new Workshop store format in as many stores as possible: 30+ new ACTIVIST Workshop stores per year, every year till 2025 bringing the brand to people where they love to shop,\" added Chaturvedi. Plum Plum would be closing the financial year at over 2x the revenue of the previous FY, complemented by the 44 percent growth seen in its overall customer base with a 96.54 percent increase in repeat buyers which is a great win in the D2C space. \u201cWe raised $35 million (Rs 270 crore) in a Series C round in March 2022 totaling our funding to over $50 million. With this, our efforts have been towards bringing in more salient brand communication, growing our omnichannel presence and onboarding high-quality talent with a focus on investments in marketing and technology,\u201d said Shankar Prasad, Founder & CEO, Plum Having launched over 8 exclusive brand outlets in the last year across cities, the brand plans to scale this up to 50 in the coming year. Furthermore, Plum onboarded Rashmika Mandanna and Mithila Palkar as its brand ambassadors for the Plum skincare range and Ananya Panday for the Plum Body Lovin\u2019 fragrance range. \u201cWe would be expanding our makeup range aggressively with a host of innovative product formats in the coming year. We would also be launching a line of products in the essentials and advanced ranges under both skincare and haircare categories,\u201d added Prasad. Colorbar The post-pandemic period has witnessed a radical shift in consumer behavior and expectations. As per research, the total retail sale is expected to reach $5.5 trillion by 2027 with online sales making up 30 percent of the market. The retail industry has been largely shadowed by challenges across the supply chain, economic uncertainty, and geo-political factors. I feel that going forward, the only way for retailers to sail through is by exhibiting strong levels of adaptability, agility, and flexibility. \"As we graduate into the next year, we can expect a renewed focus on enhancing the customer shopping journey by providing a seamless experience for hybrid shopping. Re-invention of physical store designs along with a robust omnichannel strategy would, however, emerge as a top priority. Many companies will be seen adding features to support new shopping initiatives while integrating technologies supporting AR\/VR advancements. We are aligned to lead the change and have a strong conviction that our strategy would create benchmarks of excellence in 2023,\u201d stated Samir Kumaar Modi, Founder, and Managing Director, Colorbar Cosmetics. Kapiva \u201cWe have been relentlessly working towards improving the health and wellness quotient of Indians with Ayurveda. Recently, we expanded in the US and UAE to enable this for the global audience as well. Our focus this year was on increasing the effectiveness of our products. We\u2019ve moved the needle on that front by successfully conducting a clinical trial for our Dia Free Juice. It has also proven to be effective in decreasing HbA1c to an extent of 11 percent and increasing insulin production in the body by up to 25-30 percent. However, the highlight of the year was definitely the recognition by Honorable PM Modi,\u201d said Ameve Sharma, Founder, Kapiva. In the upcoming year, Kapiva aims to double down, concurrently increasing brand awareness and recall to become a household name. Modern consumers are less concerned with outward appearance than they once were, and are more concerned with their complete well-being, which encompasses physical, mental, and emotional health. In order to capitalize on this trend, Kapiva is constantly creating consumer awareness by keeping the emphasis on the paramount importance of Ayurveda and how it can enable people to live a holistic lifestyle. Earth Rhythm 2022 was a favorable year for Earth Rhythm, as it brought in a lot of positive changes in terms of organization, growth, and product. At an organizational level, the brand was able to double the size of the team with its customer base growing 4x times compared to the previous financial year. The brand also went offline with the launch of its exclusive kiosks at 12 different locations across India. \u201cWe are expanding our makeup category which will go on to strengthen Earth Rhythm\u2019s wide-ranging portfolio, we have also been intensifying the existing categories. True to our digital-first identity, it was also a natural step for us to continue investing in technology in a bid to further streamline operations and give our customers every convenience they desire. We successfully launched our very own mobile App for both Android and iOS platforms this year and have been gaining steady traction on it. Next year, we plan to further build our portfolio by deepening the makeup category launched in 2022. We reckon 2x growth over FY 2021-22,\u201d said Harini Sivakumar, Founder, and CEO, Earth Rhythm. In keeping with this shift in the consumer\u2019s preference, the brand aims to reinforce its multifunctional product range in both makeup and personal care (face, body, hair), aimed at eliminating the need for and use of multiple products in everyday makeup and skincare routines. ARATA This year at Arata launched over 20 products and 30 offline stores across India, steadily growing 10 percent month on month with respect to GMV. \u201cIn the upcoming year, we will go full throttle to bridge the gaps in our product line and be a one-stop shop for all hair care needs. We have already begun our groundwork and have set processes to create formulas in the anti-hair fall, hair colorants, and hair styling segments,\u201d said Dhruv Madhok, Co-Founder, ARATA. BlushBee 2022 has been the year of the first full-fledged operations for Blushbee. Beginning with just three products and later expanding to 10 categories with 64 unique SKUs, the brand has witnessed massive organic growth in its customer base. BlushBee as a cosmetics line is a product of careful decisions in choosing what it wants, the other advantage is that being a clean and green beauty brand which is an important factor in the value proposition. \u201cWe hope to grow into a one-stop shop for all things related to color cosmetics, so we are actively looking into introducing new products like foundations, gloss, and so on. We have also discussed extending our horizons beyond just the realm of color cosmetics very soon,\u201d stated Shobana and Navneethan, Founders, BlushBee Organic Beauty Brand. Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co The brand was launched in 2022 with the mindset of embracing the true self and exploring the crazy side. The brand is PETA and IFRA certified, FDA approved, and currently provides the best possible sensorial experience in Hair Care with India's First Date Seed Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Hair Oil. \u201cIn the short term, we are working towards expanding on two fronts- launching more affordable luxury products across categories in which we operate. With the right set of team, products, and marketing strategy we were able to launch our brand, and today, 6 months post the launch we are happy to serve more than 2000+ households,\u201d commented Damanjit Kohli and Karishma Sahni, Founders, Crazy Owl - Your Skin Co. Increasing its touchpoint and interaction with the product, currently, Crazy Owl has signed up on all major marketplace platforms \u2013 Amazon Launchpad, Flipkart Propel Program, Purple, Snapdeal, Tata 1 mg, First cry, Myntra, Nykaa, Bigbasket and will be launching itself on Blink it, Paytm, Pharmeasy and Shopperstop planning to grow its channel every month. Pilgrim \u201cAs one of the fastest growing personal care brands in India, we have seen significant growth in the last 12 months and clocked a sale of Rs 10 crore per month along with a growth of 6X. With the trust that the brand has built throughout, we have had some great partnerships this year for our campaigns. Celebrity shout-outs from personalities like Soha Ali Khan, and Vidya Balan, and association with Kalki Koechlin in our most recent commercial have been one of the key highlights,\u201d said Anurag, Co-Founder and CEO, Pilgrim. With a strong consumer base of 1 million, the brand aims to improve its interaction and thus upgraded its technology. Along with updating its technology, the brand is also using innovative ways to reach its target audience. Pilgrim aims to be a Rs 1,000 crore brand in the next 3-4 years by facilitating new product and category launches and exploring newer international markets like the Middle East.
