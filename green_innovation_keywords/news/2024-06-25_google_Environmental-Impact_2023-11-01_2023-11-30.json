Progress will require a combination of technology, policy, and behavior change. An increasingly conscious base of consumers and employees may prove helpful. Bain & Company published today a major new study exploring the top sustainability concerns for business leaders, their customers, and their employees. \"We have spoken to thousands of executives about their sustainability ambitions and the associated trade-offs,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Faelli, partner and head of the global Sustainability practice at Bain & Company. \"They know they have a key role to play in the energy and resources transition. Many view this as their legacy, but they are worried about the growing gap between their progress and public commitments. While it will not be easy, there are three levers CEOs must prioritize: policy, technology, and behavior. Bain's new research offers some promising news for businesses\u2014their customers and employees are adaptable and eager to contribute along the path to progress.\" To get a broad sense of environmental concerns around the world, Bain surveyed 23,000 consumers. The results underscore the growing urgency of sustainability topics. Some 64% of people reported high levels of concern about sustainability. Most said their worries have intensified over the past two years and that their concern was first prompted by extreme weather. Surprising truths about consumers Bain's research reveals several surprising truths about consumers, dispelling some common misperceptions. Among them, the ideas that consumers won't pay more for sustainable products and that consumer behavior is fixed. Baby boomers are often just as concerned as Gen Z. Many companies have long viewed younger consumers as more focused on sustainability than their older counterparts, but the reality is not as clear-cut. For example, 72% of Gen Z consumers and 68% of boomers globally are very or extremely concerned about the environment, but in countries as diverse as India , France , and Japan , boomers are more concerned.

For example, 72% of Gen Z consumers and 68% of boomers globally are very or extremely concerned about the environment, but in countries as diverse as , , and , boomers are more concerned. Both liberals and conservatives are concerned about the environment. In the US, 96% of consumers agree that the climate is changing. Among those concerned about the environment in the US, 85% of self-described liberal voters are very or extremely concerned about climate change, compared with 39% of conservative voters. Yet conservatives say they worry more about specific issues such as water, biodiversity loss, and air pollution. In the US, 96% of consumers agree that the climate is changing.

Yet conservatives say they worry more about specific issues such as water, biodiversity loss, and air pollution. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products, 12% on average, but they are still priced too high. As concerns grow, consumers are looking to make environmentally sound choices and are willing to pay more for sustainable products. Yet, they often run into barriers. For example, consumers in the US are willing to pay an average premium of 11% for products with a minimized environmental impact. However, 28% is the average premium for products marketed as sustainable in the US. Consumers in fast growing markets, where Bain found environmental concerns to be highest\u2014such as India , Indonesia , Brazil , and China\u2014are willing to pay an even greater premium, between 15 and 20%. Consumers in the UK, Italy , Germany , and France , on the other hand, are only willing to pay between 8 and 10% extra.

Consumer behavior can change more quickly than many companies anticipate , with external factors such as government regulation heavily influencing the market. China began offering financial incentives on electric vehicles in 2009; now 19% of Chinese consumers report driving an electric car, compared with 8% of consumers globally. In England , the use of single-use supermarket plastic bags has fallen 98% since the government began requiring retailers to charge for them in 2015. , with external factors such as government regulation heavily influencing the market. began offering financial incentives on electric vehicles in 2009; now 19% of Chinese consumers report driving an electric car, compared with 8% of consumers globally. In , the use of single-use supermarket plastic bags has fallen 98% since the government began requiring retailers to charge for them in 2015. There is a disconnect between what consumers want and what most companies sell. Worldwide, 48% of consumers consider how products are used when thinking about sustainability. These consumers are more concerned about how a product can be reused, its durability, and how it will minimize waste. In contrast, most companies sell sustainable goods based on factors such as how they are made, their natural ingredients, and the farming practices deployed. These factors cause many consumers to conflate \"sustainable\" with \"premium.\" One result of this disconnect: Nearly half of all developed-market consumers believe that living sustainably is too expensive. By comparison, roughly 35% of consumers in fast-growing markets believe this. Worldwide, 48% of consumers consider how products are used when thinking about sustainability.

By comparison, roughly 35% of consumers in fast-growing markets believe this. Consumers struggle to identify sustainable products and don't trust corporations to make them. In Bain's survey, 50% of consumers said sustainability is one of their top four key purchase criteria when shopping. Yet they may be making decisions based on misconceptions. When asked to determine which of two given products generated higher carbon emissions, consumers were wrong or didn't know about 75% of the time. Consumers say they rely most on labels and certifications to identify sustainable products, yet most were unable to accurately describe the meaning behind common sustainability logos, such as organic production or Fairtrade. A lack of trust in corporations compounds the issue. Bain found only 28% of consumers trust large corporations to create genuinely sustainable products, compared to 45% who trust small, independent businesses. Four critical areas of focus for companies The momentum behind sustainability and dynamic shifts in consumer behavior have profound implications for any company. Bain sees four critical areas of focus. Devise a future-proof and flexible strategy. Few companies plan beyond the typical 3-year strategic planning window, and even those that do look out 5 to 10 years tend to focus on expectations for technology adoption. These plans fail to fully consider two other factors that move just as rapidly and with as big an impact: regulations and consumer behavior.

These plans fail to fully consider two other factors that move just as rapidly and with as big an impact: regulations and consumer behavior. Acknowledge a fragmented consumer base. Companies need to deaverage consumers and innovate products and design propositions that appeal to different segments\u2014 local markets, consumers with different definitions of sustainability, and consumers with a range of purchasing motivations. Companies need to deaverage consumers and innovate products and design propositions that appeal to different segments\u2014 local markets, consumers with different definitions of sustainability, and consumers with a range of purchasing motivations. Test and learn to determine what works\u2014and repeat. In such a fluid environment, companies can lean aggressively on marketing experimentation, using digital tools to quickly test the sustainability messages that resonate with different segments and adapt accordingly. It's a way to help consumers gain enough clarity to make decisions that are consistent with their values. In such a fluid environment, companies can lean aggressively on marketing experimentation, using digital tools to quickly test the sustainability messages that resonate with different segments and adapt accordingly. It's a way to help consumers gain enough clarity to make decisions that are consistent with their values. Get out in front of regulations. As we've seen throughout the world, government policy inevitably becomes a huge contributor to changing consumer behavior. Across all industries, companies need to be at the forefront of helping to shape the regulations affecting their business. A company's ability to anticipate policy shifts and build future-proof portfolios will help determine whether it can outpace competitors. Upskilling employees to rise to the challenge Bain found 75% of business leaders believe they have not embedded sustainability well into their business. The instinct of many CEOs is to prioritize external hiring to address all skill gaps, including in sustainability. Bain advocates for addressing sustainability's challenges through a combination of smart upskilling and cultivating a learning mindset. A new Bain survey of 4,700 people found 63% felt different skills and behaviors would be required for their company to execute on its ESG ambition or strategy. Yet only 45% of nonmanagers said their employer offers the reskilling and upskilling opportunities that would enable internal mobility. Despite almost every CEO saying they have a talent problem, few companies have defined what it means to be a great employer. In Bain's recent survey, 44% of respondents said it is easier to find a better opportunity outside of their company than within it. Bain is leading by example on this cause. The firm has committed to cultivating a growth mindset in its team, partnering with 12 world-class universities\u2014including MIT, HEC Paris, and Melbourne Business School\u2014to upskill its employees on ESG. To date, its consultants have completed over 17,000 hours of ESG training through the program.

In the run-up to COP28, we spoke with Robert Metzke, Global Head of Sustainability, on how Philips has continued to make steps to embed sustainability and climate action in healthcare delivery. With its Scope 1 (internal) and Scope 2 (energy sourcing) emissions firmly under control, the company has turned its sights on partnering to reduce its Scope 3 emissions \u2013 those beyond its direct control \u2013 to ensure end-to-end value chain sustainability. In early 2023, Philips became the first health technology company to have its entire value-chain CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). What is Philips\u2019 focus at COP28? Robert Metzke: One of the best parts of my job is engaging with inspiring thinkers - from international organizations, governments, business companies and civil society - to learn from each other\u2019s expertise, share our own experience, embrace new ways of thinking and operating, and galvanize shared action to tackle global challenges. Our focus at COP28 is extending our sustainability impact with the healthcare industry by engaging with governments and partner stakeholders. In the healthcare industry, there\u2019s strong global momentum \u2013 a huge number of care providers recognize that they need to tackle their impact on the environment, in terms of both carbon emissions and beyond. In our conversations with hospitals, they tell us they want to commit to become carbon neutral. We can help them start and scale with our decades of experience, our in-house expertise, successful case studies and best practices. In healthcare, the main share of carbon emissions (71%) are indirect emissions caused by the production and transportation of goods and services that hospitals purchase, such as medicines, food, equipment, clothing, and waste treatment [1]. Reducing these is a big opportunity. The good news is that suppliers are also focused on this topic, where increasingly a combination of legislation, transparency, reporting pressure, and employees who prefer to work for sustainable companies is driving change. The critical part is the capability to act. Philips builds capabilities with its customer and suppliers, providing very practical help. What capabilities does Philips have to contribute the improving sustainability in healthcare? Robert: Underpinned by innovation, digitalization and collaboration, Philips\u2019 efforts to drive sustainable healthcare are based on 1) Energy efficiency within the company\u2019s own operations and across our product portfolio, with an added focus on reducing the amount of energy its products consume when in use; 2) Resource efficiency to maximize the value of our products and solutions over their lifetime, while minimizing material and resource use and reducing waste; 3) Care pathway optimization by co-creating new (digital and circular) health solutions that reduce healthcare\u2019s carbon footprint and enable the delivery of quality care to those who need it, especially in medically underserved communities. What approaches is Philips taking to achieve its energy and resource efficiency goals? Robert: Since 2020 our global operation is carbon neutral, using 100% renewable electricity. We continue to build new partnerships for renewable electricity.\u201d An example is the consortium led renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) through which Philips and global brewing company HEINEKEN agreed to purchase the output of energy company Cero Generation\u2019s new 70MW Pontinia agrivoltaic solar farm project in Lazio, Italy. The agricultural element of the project will also provide crop-growing experience and training to vulnerable and socially excluded people in the Lazio region. ","filter_flag":1}

More concerning, only 14% of companies indicated reducing emissions in line with their ambitions, down 3pp from those reporting the same in 2022. Companies indicated that their reduction efforts have been obstructed by several challenges, most notably difficult macroeconomic conditions and capital constraints. Signs of Progress Despite these discouraging results at a global level, there are bright spots to highlight. On Scope 3, for example, companies have taken steps to significantly improve the coverage of their emissions measurement and reporting. The number of respondents indicating partial measurement and reporting of Scope 3 emissions has increased by 19pp since 2021, from 34% to 53%. In tandem, more respondents said they have set Scope 3 reduction targets\u2014up 12pp since 2021, from 23% to 35%\u2014with the most common areas of focus being waste management and purchased goods and services. According to the CDP, supply chain emissions (Scope 3) are, on average, 11.4 times greater than operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). Hence, the reported increase in Scope 3 measurement and reporting is encouraging, as increased collaboration along the supply chain is essential to attaining net zero. In addition, some regions have demonstrated a clear improvement in emissions measurement during the past two years. Since 2021, the number of Asia-Pacific respondents comprehensively reporting Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions increased by 7pp, while the number of South American and North American respondents comprehensively reporting their internal emissions\u2014Scopes 1 and 2\u2014grew by 9pp and 5pp, respectively. To drive more robust emissions accounting, countries have started to implement regulations related to climate-related disclosure and reporting. Many of these regulations initially call on large, publicly listed companies to report emissions and other climate impacts; in follow-on phases, the regulations will be expanded to smaller entities. Such regulations will likely spur more comprehensive reporting of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions over the next few years, once they are fully in effect. Competitive Advantage Decarbonization provides a host of financial and nonfinancial rewards to businesses. A growing number of companies recognize this, citing the following as top benefits: reputational value, lower operating costs, greater regulatory compliance, higher valuations, increased revenues, the improved attraction and retention of talent, and tax savings. When asked to quantify, 40% of respondents estimated an annual financial benefit of at least $100 million for meeting emissions reduction targets, a 3pp increase compared with last year\u2019s survey. Businesses that have made decarbonization progress are capturing these wide-ranging benefits and gaining a competitive edge over their peers. To catch up, laggards will need to accelerate their emissions reduction in the near term, even as their measurement and reporting are still maturing. A Path Forward When we compare companies that report reducing their emissions in line with their ambitions and those that do not, we find that the former disproportionately display four notable traits: They collaborate with suppliers and customers on emissions measurement and reduction. They calculate emissions at the product level. They harness the power of digital technology in the emissions management process. They consider emissions-reporting regulations to be a key enabler of reduction. Collaborating with Suppliers and Customers. As indicated above, companies globally have made strides in expanding their Scope 3 coverage and establishing reduction targets over the past two years. Businesses reported that, in their efforts to meet these new targets, they have benefited significantly from robust partnerships with both suppliers and customers. Indeed, 75% of companies that cut emissions in line with their ambition have joint reduction initiatives with most of their suppliers, and 54% have similar initiatives with most of their customers. Schneider Electric, a global energy technology company, is an example of an organization unifying its supply chain in a broad emissions reduction effort. In 2021, the company launched partnerships with more than 1,000 of its suppliers to calculate, report, and set goals on emissions reduction. Through workshops and educational webinars, the company catalyzed nearly 900 suppliers to begin reporting and actively decreasing emissions, driving progress beyond the gates of its own operations. Calculating Emissions at the Product Level. We find that 75% of companies attempt to measure emissions for at least some of their products from cradle to gate, that is, from raw materials to distribution. To be most effective, these product-level assessments require regular supplier input and accurate attribution of emissions to each product. Reckitt, a multinational consumer goods company, sees its product-level approach as critical to meeting its sustainability targets, including emissions reduction. Fabrice Beaulieu, the company\u2019s chief marketing, sustainability, and corporate affairs officer, adds, \u201cConsumers expect brands to meet their needs, while also using less plastic and emitting less carbon. Our playbook for sustainable product innovation leverages the power of product-level data to meet these expectations and drive more sustainable product design.\u201d As consumers drive demand for new or upgraded products, the company deploys its internal Sustainable Innovation Calculator to compare the footprints of various product designs, evaluating the impact that different compositions, packaging, transport modes, and other factors have on a product\u2019s overall sustainability score. Reckitt uses these assessments to innovate and develop new products that have lower environmental impact compared with the products they replace. Fabrice highlights, \u201cWe innovate to create value for consumers, meet their evolving demands, and lower our environmental impact. The scientific precision of our tools helps us create more sustainable and attractive products, fulfilling these goals.\u201d Reckitt also seeks to use product-level innovation to improve sustainability in consumer behaviors. For example, Reckitt\u2019s dishwashing brand, Finish, is innovating to meet the UN\u2019s Sustainability Development Goal focused on clean water and sanitation. The brand reformulated Finish dishwashing products to eliminate the need for prerinsing, enabling customers to save water in their everyday use of the product. This type of innovation allows Reckitt to engage consumers, persuade them to act differently, and, in doing so, reduce their own environmental footprint. Kl\u00f6ckner & Co is one of the largest producer-independent distributors of steel and metal products and one of the leading steel service companies worldwide, with more than 90,000 customers. As a pioneer in the sustainable steel industry, Kl\u00f6ckner & Co developed a proprietary Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) calculation engine, the Nexigen PCF Algorithm, which has calculated more than 200,000 PCFs. (Nexigen is a trademark of Kl\u00f6ckner & Co.) Each PCF calculated is accompanied by a T\u00dcV S\u00dcD certificate that is available to Kl\u00f6ckner & Co\u2019s customers with each green material purchased. Taking its Nexigen PCF Algorithm a step further, Kl\u00f6ckner & Co developed a solution, Nexigen Data Services, that enables customers to see the carbon footprint of their past purchases and offers greener alternatives for future purchases. Felix Schmitz, CEO of Kl\u00f6ckner & Co subsidiary Kloeckner Metals Germany, comments, \u201cGreen steel is the way forward, and we arm our customers with decision-useful product-level data. This information enables customers to make green purchase decisions, and it sends a demand signal back through the whole supply chain.\u201d As a result, Kl\u00f6ckner & Co\u2019s customers are empowered by knowing the exact carbon footprint of each product and can easily choose greener alternatives. Harnessing the Power of Digital Technology. Technology solutions improve accuracy and efficiency when assessing emissions and can help identify innovative ways to reduce them. Our survey finds that companies with automated digital solutions for measurement are 2.5 times more likely to measure their emissions comprehensively. In addition, surveyed companies listed technology adoption and use as the leading strategic enabler for improving emissions reduction in their organization. As an example, The Economist Group, a global media and information services company, deploys CO2 AI\u2019s data platform, an end-to-end sustainability platform that helps large, complex organizations manage their sustainability goals by measuring and reducing emissions at scale. The decision to use a technology solution such as CO2 AI came from The Economist Group\u2019s focus on a science-based and data-driven approach. \u201cThe Economist Group is known for the rigor and accuracy of both its reporting and its business-intelligence products and services, and we wanted to ensure that this was reflected in our [sustainability] approach,\u201d says Emily Jackson, SVP Sustainability. CO2 AI\u2013enabled automation of measurement also generates efficiency for the company. \u201cMeasuring emissions is key for monitoring our progress and for KPI and disclosure reporting\u2014but it is a highly repetitive process. It made good business sense to use an automated tool to do this on a monthly or quarterly basis, rather than tie up team resources,\u201d remarks Jackson. Most important, The Economist Group uses the platform in translating measurement into actual reduction. The company has identified hot spots, found new reduction levers, and used key tool outputs to engage top-emitting suppliers in new joint reduction initiatives. \u201cEmissions heat maps have opened up transparent conversations on reduction with our suppliers where we didn\u2019t have them before,\u201d Jackson adds. As AI matures, digital technology solutions will continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and decision making in emissions management. Companies recognize this potential. Of those surveyed, about 30% plan to expand deployment of AI-powered tools in the next three years across a variety of functions, including predictive modeling and supply chain tracking. Viewing Regulations Positively. Companies that are reducing their emissions in line with their ambition are twice as likely to view emissions-reporting regulations as helpful guidance to their emissions measurement approach and twice as likely to view the regulations as an enabler of emissions reduction. These findings suggest that, in addition to the internal company practices highlighted above, external reporting mechanisms can play a pivotal role in advancing emissions reduction. Through collaboration, product-level assessments, and digital technology, companies can find the data and strategies they need to close the gap between their actions and their ambitions in reducing emissions. Progress in these areas will not only alleviate the burden of climate change but also deliver a boost to the bottom line.

It\u2019s a big opportunity. An estimated 22 billion pairs of shoes are thrown out annually while roughly the same number are produced, according to industry stats. The fashion and apparel sector contributes about 8 percent of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the United Nations. Crocs announced a series of sustainability goals in 2021, but quietly delayed its plan to reach net zero by a decade to 2040 after the company reported a big increase in emissions between 2021 and 2022. Deanna Bratter, vice president and global head of sustainability for the Broomfield, Colorado-based company, said circular design and production principles are core to delivering on that commitment. \"When you think about the circular economy, sometimes people just think about waste and doing something with waste,\" Bratter said. \"But when we think about the concept of creating a circular economy, it requires a variety of solutions, a lot of creativity.\" Three things will help Crocs deliver, she said: Design changes that enable products to be used for longer. Considering the need for future deconstruction and recyclability. Finding sources for renewable inputs. From \u2018gently used\u2019 to \u2018unwearable\u2019 Crocs\u2019 new collection program will produce metrics to help it better understand the social and operational challenges it faces, Bratter said. Rather than randomly assigning takeback locations on a nationwide basis, it picked states that represent a cross-section of attitudes about climate change: Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. Retail locations in those states, about 50 in total, will include collection bins to make it simpler for consumers to drop off products. Crocs will accept shoes in any condition. \"Gently used\" ones will be donated to Soles4Souls, a nonprofit that works with entrepreneurs building secondhand apparel businesses. Those that are \"well-loved\" or \"unwearable\" will head back to Crocs, where product designers will experiment with ways to reuse the materials, Bratter said. Here are some questions Crocs hopes to answer with its collection program: Who is returning shoes? What marketing messages are working? Are consumers donating because of the social or environmental impact? What types of shoes are most commonly returned and how old are they? Do gently used or well-loved shoes dominate the bins? The goal is to expand nationally, Bratter said. Crocs chose the U.S. as its first foray into product take-back because it can transport them to other locations for processing more easily. What\u2019s inside Crocs\u2019 clogs The predominant material in Crocs\u2019 clogs \u2014 more than 81 percent \u2014 is Croslite, a proprietary resin designed for durability and sourced predominantly from fossil fuels. Croslite is responsible for 35-40 percent of Crocs\u2019 emissions, its largest single source, Bratter said. Crocs has committed to sourcing 50 percent of its Croslite from bio-based options by 2030. The two most prominent alternative sources are tall oil, a byproduct from paper mills, and used cooking oil. In 2022, only 2.2 percent of Croslite came from non-fossil sources, but Crocs is on track to meet 20 percent by the end of 2023, Bratter said. Crocs is also increasing its use of recycled material. The company uses manufacturing scraps in 6.5 percent of its Croslite, according to the company\u2019s 2022 ESG report. It\u2019s possible that unwearable shoes collected by Crocs could be ground down and used in future products, increasing that amount, Bratter said, but it hasn\u2019t publicly set goals for how many of them will be converted. Baby steps rather than a big leap The entire footwear sector is under pressure to cut waste and reduce emissions, according to Paul Foulkes-Arellano, founder of Circuthon Consulting and co-author of a book about materials and sustainability. While he praised Crocs\u2019 decision to partner with \"well-respected\" Soles4Souls, he characterized the footwear company\u2019s overall circular economy strategy as nascent and said it\u2019s \u201cnotoriously difficult\u201d to make takeback programs work at scale. One advantage Crocs will have as it transitions is the makeup of Croslite. \"It\u2019s principally a monomaterial, so once the few extra components are removed, it can be reground as material for new shoes,\" he said. Recycling a material that includes both fossil fuels- and plant-based resins is more difficult, he said. Other shoemakers are striving for higher percentages of reused material on a shorter timeline, Foulkes-Arellano said. \"The footwear industry is way behind the textiles industry in its understanding of environmental impacts.\"","filter_flag":1}

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda? It is vital governments talk about the seriousness of climate change through a concerted public awareness campaign. Citizens will be unwilling to support action until our heads of state explain clearly how we require fundamental change. A massive program of decarbonization requires governments to think differently about how it will be financed and how society itself is structured. In 1940, Winston Churchill asked the House of Commons for a vote of confidence in his new all-party government, explaining: \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\u201d Tackling the climate crisis requires a war-time effort from bold politicians. What sustainability effort do you hope will gain popularity with the general public this year, and why? Humanity is a vast, complex, adaptive system in the middle of a major reconfiguration. High-carbon products and services are becoming less acceptable and desirable, but we need to focus our efforts on shifting advertising spend. The industry spent $795 billion in 2022, but it is becoming increasingly expensive persuading people to buy products and services that we know are causing damage to ourselves, our planet, and our children. New products like alternative proteins have potential to undercut meat. An electric car is simply a cheaper, better product that makes the right choice very easy to make. What\u2019s the most important climate legislation that could pass in the next year? We urgently need to tax aircraft and ship fuels. In general, all climate policies are good, like carbon regulation through the E.U. emissions trading scheme, industrial investment by China in electric vehicles and renewable energy that in 2022 roughly matched the rest of the world combined, or the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. that offers $370 billion in low-carbon incentives. Like cigarettes, we should ban the advertising of high-carbon products. Whichever countries move fastest to decarbonize will gain leadership in industries of the future. Above all, we must stop fossil-fuel money controlling politics in democracies. The IRA has sparked a global race to capture clean tech. I would hope to see more efforts by national governments to pass legislation to win over new climate-related investments. Contact us at letters@time.com.","filter_flag":1}

Recent history has taught us that every time a new building code is adopted, stricter codes for meeting high-performance design requirements are expected. Paired with the sustainability goals of developers and owners, there is increasing energy-savings pressure on retrofitting the 6 million commercial buildings and 101 million single-family homes that were built prior to 2000. Owners of these older buildings expect architects to know how to meet the new codes, understand how to best use new and innovative building products, and avoid fines while reducing environmental impact and navigating the achievement of building certifications like WELL AP and LEED. Plus, some U.S. states and municipalities are adopting codes to limit or ban on-site fossil fuels\u2014oil, gas, and propane\u2014in new buildings and instead be powered on-site or off-site renewable energy. Alongside each building owner\u2019s goals to reduce carbon emissions and meet net-zero goals, it\u2019s no surprise there is considerable pressure on architects to deliver streamlined energy-reducing retrofit designs. However, with experts predicting $21 billion that\u2019s expected to be spent on retrofits through 2030, knowing how to strategize and implement energy-efficient technologies and systems is an expertise that is also a worthy investment. Partnering with a local utility company that prioritizes decarbonizing the economy and providing clean, fair, and affordable power, like National Grid, is one way to help relieve some of the pressure. Through initial rebates for energy-saving building products like lighting, HVAC, smart technology, and other systems, local utility partners like National Grid are helping their customers meet sustainability goals for environmental product declarations, lower embodied carbon of their buildings, and decreased emissions. Even with millions of buildings falling short of low carbon emissions, only about 1% of existing buildings are retrofitted each year with upgraded insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, smart thermostats, energy-efficient lighting, and other weatherization strategies. That\u2019s far lower than the International Energy Agency\u2019s benchmark that requires an annual rate of 2.5% retrofits of older buildings, which would reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This push toward net-zero isn\u2019t possible without everyone working together during the planning and design phase of a retrofit. Carefully planned upgrades can reduce water and energy usage, reduce the building\u2019s carbon footprint, and control humidity levels while meeting sustainability and benchmarking goals. Still, not all older commercial buildings and houses are worthwhile retrofit candidates. And until the launch of the CARE Tool, which helps designers and owners assess whether reusing or building new is the best carbon strategy, it wasn\u2019t easy to evaluate the embodied carbon benefits of retrofits. Weighing the benefits of reusing older buildings with embodied carbon and carbon emissions as a benchmark, the decisions made during the assessment, design, and planning stages are essential to deliver a smart retrofit that helps increase the nation\u2019s building stock to reach net-zero by 2050. With the race toward net-zero underway, it\u2019s helpful to consider working with a trusted partner like National Grid who can help achieve energy-savings goals in retrofit projects.

Asos and Primark are among the big names signed up to Wrap\u2019s voluntary environmental pact, Textiles 2030. While the companies involved have managed to reduce both the carbon intensity and volume of water per metric ton used in their clothing manufacture, in its annual progress report, published today, the climate action NGO warns of hard-won gains being \u201ccanceled out\u201d because clothing production is \u201cspiraling upwards.\u201d Textiles and fashion are responsible for up to 10 percent of global carbon emissions. Catherine David, Wrap\u2019s director of behavior change and business programs, said the progress made by 130 brands and retailers involved showed \u201cit\u2019s possible to change this.\u201d But that at the moment, \u201cas fast as positive improvements happen, they\u2019re canceled out by rising production.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working with companies to improve clothes, but the other part of the equation is our role as shoppers.\u201d The companies had reduced the carbon impact of their textiles by 12 percent and water by 4 percent (on a per-ton basis) between 2019 and 2022. However, this was negated by a 13 percent increase in the volume of textiles produced and sold, according to the report. The increased production rates meant overall water use actually rose by 8 percent over the period, while the carbon reduction figure stood at just 2 percent. Since production is obviously related to consumption, David said consumers had a part to play. \u201cWe\u2019re working with companies to improve clothes, but the other part of the equation is our role as shoppers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe buy more clothes than any other nation in Europe. \u201cOur research shows that a quarter of most wardrobes go unworn in a year and nearly a quarter of us admit to wearing clothes only a few times,\u201d she continued. \u201cMoving into winter is the perfect time to look through our wardrobes\u2014wear what we have and consider whether it\u2019s time to let something go. You can donate, sell or give clothes away\u2014it all helps them move around the economy and reduce the amount produced.\u201d Wrap wants businesses to design clothes for a longer life, with good durability and recyclability and more recycled content. On a positive note, the report revealed that increased use of recycled polyester and polyamide had helped reduce the amount of fabric made from virgin materials. Also nearly three-quarters of cotton used by signatories now comes from improved sources such as the Better Cotton Initiative. With more brands and retailers operating take-back schemes, the volume of used textiles collected and sold for reuse or recycling between 2019 and 2022 had doubled, it said.","filter_flag":1}

In this article we\u2019ll discuss the first of the above, namely the environment, and how it relates to the Metaverse and Web3. A new form of efficiency thanks to the Metaverse The concept of efficiency goes beyond economic costs, as there\u2019s also another definition of efficiency (even more important for some people) associated with the environmental impact that we generate, be it that of a large company, an SME or even a family. One of the most positive impacts of the Metaverse with respect to environmental efficiency is related to reduced travel. The Metaverse enables us to carry out activities that normally take place in person in the real world, such as going to work, attending international congresses, travelling to conventions and concerts and so on, in a completely virtual environment from the office or the living room at home. This significantly helps us to reduce the tonnes of greenhouse gases that we normally generate when we travel by car, train or plane. One example is Movistar Immersive Experience (MEI), a new way of interacting with our Movistar world and our loved ones in a more immersive manner, together with Telef\u00f3nica Theme Park and Telef\u00f3nica World, virtual experiences that include fair games and attending events. Telef\u00f3nica promotes sustainability by means of the Metaverse by allowing us to visit a work of art such as Okuda at MEI from home without going to the museum, displaying Movistar\u2019s products and services in our virtual store and enabling us to attend the MWC from the sofa by means of the \u201cmetaversistic\u201d recreation of our physical stand, as well as events such as Metaverse Day from home with our Talent & Innovation Hub. The three Rs of recycling: reduce, reuse and recycle Web3 goes hand in hand with the concept of server decentralisation. This facilitates improved resource management, as we can manage energy efficiency and even automatically allocate energy in keeping with demand, thus reducing energy consumption. Moreover, thanks to tokenisation projects, tokens generated by the user can be converted into credits to offset the carbon footprint of various forestry projects, with several different initiatives. One example applied to the home is the App Compensa tu Huella available in the \u201cApps\u201d section of Movistar Plus+, helping us to offset the amount of CO2 generated in our home. This programme converts the use of Movistar\u2019s digital environment into tokens redeemable for exclusive rewards: data allowances, monthly subscriptions to Movistar Plus+ channels, film rentals and even Movistar LaLiga and the Champions League. When we refer to Web3, we shouldn\u2019t forget blockchain technology, which helps us to decentralise the above-mentioned servers, also serves as a tool for transparency and traceability, enabling us to track each phase accurately and simply in the life of both products and services (production, storage, transport, use and reuse). This is why Telef\u00f3nica has teamed up with the Celo non-profit organisation, which manages the development of blockchain while being carbon negative. At the same time, Telef\u00f3nica has also become a member of the \u201cCelo Alliance for Prosperity\u201d, which seeks to increase sustainability and financial inclusion through an open source, accessible and decentralised blockchain ecosystem. Telef\u00f3nica reuses its extensive network infrastructure, thus playing a key role as a transaction validator and facilitating the stability and security of blockchains. Also, thanks to Web3 smart contracts are also possible. These can automatically manage the sorting and recycling of waste to ensure they are done properly. A new technology, new sustainability As you\u2019ve seen, this new technological world is full of potential, but the relationship between innovation and sustainability will only be positive if projects like the Metaverse and Web3 also focus on being environment friendly. Telef\u00f3nica believes that there can be no progress without caring for the environment and, for this reason and many others, it participates in the GSMA Open Gateway initiative, which is laying the foundations for the networks of tomorrow to make them globally more efficient and enable us to reduce the number of servers that pollute, reuse APIs and drive future development and innovation.","filter_flag":1}

Over the past five decades, its vast productivity gains have greatly improved food security and substantially reduced the share of income that people need to spend for food. The food system has become so productive that it is now also helping to address other global issues, such as energy supply, through the growing use of biofuels. But, like virtually all other industries, food and agribusiness companies face mounting demands, from tackling the long-term health consequences of food products to fixing an outsized contribution to global climate and nature challenges. Today, agriculture consumes 70% of the world\u2019s fresh water, and the food system more broadly contributes over one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and is at the heart of the 20% of annual deaths attributed to poor diet. As a result, agriculture producers, consumer products companies, retailers, and others that make up the global food system are on the verge of coming under the same high-level scrutiny experienced by oil and gas companies. Elevating the ambition With this backdrop, food and agriculture companies have an urgent need to raise their ambitions on sustainability and health to build more future-proof and competitive businesses. There\u2019s a lot at stake for companies that fail to take the aggressive steps required. Latecomers will face rising costs to address carbon requirements for their value chains, for example. Incumbent consumer goods companies will continue to cede growth to insurgents that are doing a better job of serving consumers\u2019 rising demands for healthier food. Companies across the food chain will find themselves losing out amid the scarce supply of limited raw materials that meet environmental standards. They\u2019re already lagging in the war for top talent. A telling fact: No agribusiness or food producer was named in the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list in 2023. Acting now allows companies to turn risks into opportunities\u2014new products, categories, and markets, or increased share of growth. By our analysis, food companies that seize the initiative can benefit from a potential 15% five-year revenue uplift compared with a 43% revenue decline for companies that fall behind based on a scenario of increasingly aggressive regulation. By changing product and ingredient portfolios, as well as where and how foods are produced, large food and agriculture companies can shift the food system toward healthier and more nutritious food\u2014and healthier populations\u2014while tipping the environmental impact from negative to a net positive. An integrated food systems ambition, once defined, will have strategic implications for agriculture and food businesses in three particularly critical areas: product portfolio, agricultural sustainability, and ways of working. Here are examples of winning approaches in each of those areas. Reinventing the portfolio Product portfolio reinvention will be a critical element of food system transformation for upstream and downstream companies alike. As an example of the scale of the issues at hand, one study determined that among 50,000 food products in the US, 73% is made up of ultraprocessed foods.1 Such foods are linked to a wide range of health issues, and reduced consumption is recommended in national dietary guidelines in places as diverse as Canada and Brazil. The need to transform portfolios is not limited to downstream players. For example, agricultural input portfolios may need to add seeds that support more diverse crops, or equipment and inputs to support more sustainable farming practices\u2014in addition to supporting reduced fertilizer and chemical volumes through more precise application. Facing mounting pressure to offer healthier and more sustainable goods, companies can reevaluate their portfolio strategy to determine the product mix that will best help them meet those new demands without dismantling a core that has delivered decades of profitable growth. That means identifying and exiting the unfixable parts of the portfolio and spending more time and energy on the brands and products that have the fundamentals that will allow them to satisfy consumers' needs for delicious, healthy, and sustainable foods. When it comes to shifting food product portfolios toward better health, a common refrain from food company executives is that the indulgent segments of consumer goods categories are growing faster than the \u201cbetter for you\u201d segments. Indeed, in the US, consumption of ultraprocessed foods increased from 53.5% in 2001 to 57% in 2018, and the consumption of whole foods declined over the same period. However, many leaders are not accepting that such a shift is an either\/or decision, and the winners of the future will likely have more balanced portfolios than most food companies today. They will offer products that reduce trade-offs for consumers, introducing ones that can be delicious, healthy, and affordable. PepsiCo took a step in this direction when it started gradually lowering the amounts of sodium, saturated fat, and sugar in its snacks and beverages, with plans to bring them even lower\u2014and to do it without consumers noticing. The company already has reached its 2025 target of producing 75% of its food portfolio volume with 1.1 grams or less of saturated fat per 100 calories. It also is advancing on its targets for reducing sodium and added sugars. This shift toward healthier portfolios will get a big push from sugar and salt taxes introduced, as well as from newly required health labeling on packages. Consider that around 85 jurisdictions around the world have implemented a form of sugar tax. Also at play: a flood of venture financing\u2014roughly $13 billion\u2014was invested into sustainable food systems technology and innovation globally in 2021. (By comparison, the total R&D budget for the top 10 global food companies was roughly $4 billion.) This magnitude of venture funding to solve the problems of health and sustainability shows these issues are already a major focus among private investors. Now, the question is whether food companies will get ahead of this imperative or be disrupted by it. In addition to aggressively reducing salt and sugar content in its products, Nestl\u00e9 has turned to M&A to transform its portfolio. In the years 2017\u201322 the world\u2019s largest food company made more than 20 acquisitions and sold 10 business units. During that period, total shareholder return rose by an annual 9.5%. Nestl\u00e9 also has committed substantially more funds to sustainability efforts, more than $1 billion annually, twice as much as the next competitor. Accelerating agricultural transformation Almost all food and agriculture companies are way behind in their Scope 3 emissions reduction. Agricultural production contributes two-thirds of those emissions, which could be substantially reduced through more sustainable farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture for crops (see Figure 1). But adoption of these practices is low, and until companies can solve the scaling problem, they will fail to achieve their Scope 3 commitments. Most important, they will fail to realize the opportunity that exists for agriculture to reduce its own climate impact and be a positive contributor on the path to net zero and in other areas such as water and biodiversity. Figure 1 Addressing Scope 3 emissions through regenerative agriculture is a powerful opportunity to deliver on GHG commitments Reducing the food supply carbon footprint requires engagement across the food value chain\u2014everyone from input and equipment providers, to farmers, to commodity traders and processors, to ingredient and food companies\u2014and with a broader ecosystem of stakeholders such as governments, financial services providers, investors, and grower organizations. As far back as the 1980s, soil health was a growing concern for many stakeholders in the Canadian food system who wanted to generate acceptance for conservation tillage, a regenerative agriculture practice. After local farm associations spread awareness and provided technical expertise, equipment companies marketed new equipment, prototyped by entrepreneurial local farmers, that made conservation tillage compatible with mechanical seeding. Meanwhile, the federal government offered grants to reduce upfront costs of new equipment. As a result of coordinated ecosystem action, adoption of conservation tillage practices in Canada are now at almost 80%, substantially further ahead than other developed markets. Success calls for a paradigm shift for upstream and downstream companies: putting growers at the center, surrounded by the right conditions for making changes. We refer to these as the 4As of adoption. Awareness: Farmers must know about climate-smart and nature-positive practices and technologies\u2014and have access to the technical expertise and support needed to implement them. Advantage: Farmers must have confidence that adopting new practices and technologies will deliver an attractive rate of return, both now and into the future. Access: The right inputs, tools, equipment, and methods must be available to farmers, when and where needed. Affordability: Upfront costs for farmers must be reasonable, with affordable financing available to support initial investments. Collaboration between players across the ecosystem is essential to establishing these 4A conditions for farmers, particularly for creating the economic case for change to growers (Advantage and Affordability), which our analysis shows is the biggest barrier to change. This requires involvement of players inside the value chain as well as those outside it, such as financial services providers. The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund is one such innovative, precompetitive partnership model, which brings together actors across the value chain (including Nutrien, Cargill, PepsiCo, Target, and ReHarvest Partners, a financial services provider) and the Iowa Soybean Association. SWOF aids farmers\u2019 transition to regenerative agriculture through payments for carbon and water outcomes. While partnership models like SWOF are encouraging, still more investment is needed. Most regenerative practices are not widely adopted, and many have yet to be adopted on even 10% of the roughly 230 million acres of soy, corn, and wheat planted annually in the US. Changing the organization Just as important as what needs to be done is how companies mobilize their enterprises to progress on these priorities. For example, it requires cross-functional collaboration in newly established forums to factor the impact on sustainability or health in funding decisions. The food systems imperative will give rise to a new set of heroes. In food retailers, it will be the merchandisers. In consumer goods companies, it will be supply chain and procurement teams. They will be the ones driving Scope 3 decarbonization. But they won\u2019t be able to do it alone. They will need to partner with brands and R&D functions to collaborate on how to address sustainability challenges in ways that deliver delicious and affordable products for consumers. As with any successful change to ways of working, this one starts with management alignment and commitment. As an example, General Mills\u2019 Global Impact Governance Committee, which includes the company\u2019s CEO, CFO, and group president, North America Retail, among others, has adopted and signed a formal charter that articulates its ownership over this enterprise mission. It is not a steering committee sitting in judgment of others\u2019 efforts. Instead, it has taken on the responsibility of seeing General Mills\u2019 mission through. In a global food system facing huge changes, winning companies will be those with unwavering support from the top\u2014and with leaders willing to make the tough trade-off decisions that inevitably will be required. Getting started Companies can begin this journey into the future by asking and answering a series of fundamental questions. How are we contributing\u2014both positively and negatively\u2014to the health and environmental footprint of the food system? How might environmental, health, consumer, technology, and regulatory dynamics\/developments affect the food industry over the next 10 years?

Asos and Primark are among the big names signed up to Wrap\u2019s voluntary environmental pact, Textiles 2030. While the companies involved have managed to reduce both the carbon intensity and volume of water per tonne used in their clothing manufacture, in its annual progress report, published today, the climate action NGO warns of hard-won gains being \u201ccancelled out\u201d because clothing production is \u201cspiralling upwards\u201d. Textiles and fashion are responsible for up to 10% of global carbon emissions. Catherine David, Wrap\u2019s director of behaviour change and business programmes, said the progress made by 130 brands and retailers involved showed \u201cit\u2019s possible to change this\u201d. But that at the moment, \u201cas fast as positive improvements happen, they\u2019re cancelled out by rising production\u201d. The companies had reduced the carbon impact of their textiles by 12% and water by 4% (on a per-tonne basis) between 2019 and 2022. However, this was negated by a 13% increase in the volume of textiles produced and sold, according to the report. The increased production rates meant overall water use actually rose by 8% over the period, while the carbon reduction figure stood at just 2%. Since production is obviously related to consumption, David said consumers had a part to play. \u201cWe\u2019re working with companies to improve clothes, but the other part of the equation is our role as shoppers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe buy more clothes than any other nation in Europe. \u201cOur research shows that a quarter of most wardrobes go unworn in a year and nearly a quarter of us admit to wearing clothes only a few times,\u201d she continued. \u201cMoving into winter is the perfect time to look through our wardrobes \u2013 wear what we have and consider whether it\u2019s time to let something go. You can donate, sell or give clothes away \u2013 it all helps them move around the economy and reduce the amount produced.\u201d Wrap wants businesses to design clothes for a longer life, with good durability and recyclability and more recycled content. On a positive note, the report revealed that increased use of recycled polyester and polyamide had helped reduce the amount of fabric made from virgin materials. Also nearly three-quarters of cotton used by signatories now comes from improved sources such as the Better Cotton Initiative. With more brands and retailers operating take-back schemes, the volume of used textiles collected and sold for reuse or recycling between 2019 and 2022 had doubled, it said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problematic plastics category has spurred a new investment partnership between global giant Nestl\u00e9 and technology company Impact Recycling\u200b. Eco-focused tech developer Impact Recycling has developed a breakthrough plastic recycling tech that will be at the centre of the company\u2019s new UK recycling plant. Nestl\u00e9 is investing \u00a37 million into Impact Recycling, which it hopes will advance how the food and beverage industry handles hard-to-recycle plastics in an environmentally responsible way. Along with a grant from Innovate UK, the plastics facility will be operational in late Summer 2024. \u201cWe want to look for solutions where we can invest to stimulate the development of much-needed recycling infrastructure in the UK,\u201d \u200bSokhna Gueye, Head of Packaging at Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland, told FoodNavigator. The problems around plastic recycling\u200b Plastics-focused plans, targets and advocates are gaining ground in the UK, spurring change in food and beverage operations. The UK government\u2019s waste reduction strategy\u200b, the Plastics Pact\u200b and Innovate UK\u2019s Circular Plastics Network\u200b seeks to eliminate the detrimental environmental impact of plastics. Flexible plastic packaging makes up a quarter of the UK consumer packaging, yet only 8% was collected for recycling in 2022, for example, Ecosurety, a B Corp-certified UK compliance scheme, shared\u200b. In response, Nestl\u00e9 stated it has undertaken extensive efforts to redesign its flexible packaging, transitioning from complex multi-material structures to simpler mono-material designs that are easier to recycle. \u201cUnfortunately, the current recycling infrastructure in the UK is not adequately equipped to handle these materials,\u201d \u200bsaid Gueye. \u201cThis investment aims to address this pressing challenge and improve recycling capacity for flexible packaging,\u201d\u200b added Gueye. The UK\u2019s Plastics Pact\u200b, launched by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) charity, aims to address plastic waste\u2019s impact on climate change. It aims to meet several targets: to eliminate problematic plastics, understand reusable versus recyclable packaging, increase plastics recycling to 70% and achieve 30% recycled content. The UK charity encourages more companies to engage in industry innovation and progress to achieve these targets. Innovate UK\u2019s Circular Plastics Network\u200b comprises a community of 5000-plus individuals who strive to progress plastic production, use and understanding to ensure they fit within a circular economy. One of its focus areas is its \u00a360 million Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging Challenge\u200b, which aims to support developments that can create positive change in the UK\u2019s ability to tackle the 3Rs of plastic packaging waste: reduce, reuse and recycle. \u200b A new way to recycle plastics\u200b Impact Recycling will open its new plastic recycling facility in Durham, UK. The plant is designed to process hard-to-recycle flexible plastics typically used in food packaging. Its tech will turn these plastics into pellets that can be reused and repurposed into new flexible products such as postbags and refuse bags. The tech works by separating post-consumer mixed rigid plastic waste to recover two consistent streams of post-consumer resin (PCR), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), each containing a 98% purity. A process called Baffled Oscillation Separation System (BOSS) organises the waste plastics by spinning them in water, which sorts different materials into those that sink and those that float, depending on their density. Separating plastic materials makes it easier to identify which ones can be recycled and enables businesses to implement the required measures to do so. Speaking on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s goals for the facility, Gueye shared: \u201cWhen open, the facility will have the capacity to take 25,000 tonnes of flexible plastic, which means it has the potential to recycle more than the amount of flexible plastic packaging Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland places on the market.\u201d\u200b Nestl\u00e9\u2019s plastic goals\u200b Plastics are a crucial element of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s business operations. \u201cIt keeps our products safe and fresh on their journey to consumers, enables them to be transported and delivered safely, and offers information about the product itself,\u201d \u200bGueye said, commenting on understanding the critical role packaging plays at Nestl\u00e9. \u201cBut we also recognise the urgent need to address the environmental impact of packaging waste, particularly plastics,\u201d \u200bGueye added. Nestl\u00e9 has implemented a process to collect packaging, such as KitKat wrappers, Purina pet food pouches, Rowntree confectionery sharing bags and Nestl\u00e9 Cereal bags from major supermarket collection points and onto recycling. \u201cEvery action we take has an impact on making a difference to how packaging is recycled and giving it a second life,\u201d\u200b Gueye said. \u201cSupporting innovative technologies like Impact Recycling is just one of the many steps we are taking on our journey to ensure our packaging doesn\u2019t end up as waste,\u201d\u200b Gueye added. Nestl\u00e9 has adopted a five-pillar strategy across three main areas as part of its waste reduction strategy. Firstly, it aims to create less packaging by reducing plastic or using virgin plastics. It also focuses on reuse and refill, Gueye said, rather than disposable packaging and strives to create better packaging by using alternative materials to facilitate recycling. In addition, it is working to develop better recycling systems and help to rethink behaviours internally and with partners and consumers. \u201cIn the UK and Ireland, our efforts continue at pace to ensure as close to 100% of our packaging is designed for recycling by 2025, and we continue to work towards all of our packaging being recyclable or reusable,\u201d \u200bsaid Gueye.","filter_flag":1}

This collaboration extends the reach of CaptureCrete, a concrete additive designed to permanently capture CO2, to the broader cement and concrete manufacturing industry. The technology offers a sustainable solution for decarbonizing a range of structures, from homes to major infrastructure projects. Supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, CaptureCrete empowers manufacturers by providing them with a licensable formula that allows them to produce the additive on-site and incorporate it into precast or ready-mix concrete, addressing the carbon emissions associated with concrete production. Recently unveiled at the 2023 Deck Expo in Las Vegas, NCP Industries introduced its new eCO2LUXE line, incorporating CaptureCrete. The line features products such as the ADORN Stone Premier Series, an exterior stone profile designed for aesthetics while actively capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, contributing to a reduction in its carbon footprint. CaptureCrete not only provides a sustainable solution but also generates carbon credits every time it is used in concrete. These credits are validated by Bureau Veritas under Covalent\u2019s Certification Standard and are available for purchase on Carbon Limit\u2019s website. Addressing the environmental impact of cement, a key ingredient in concrete production, is crucial. Cement production contributes to over 8 percent of global carbon emissions. The Global Cement and Concrete Association, representing major industry players, has pledged to reduce concrete\u2019s carbon footprint by 25 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Carbon Limit's CEO, Tim Sperry, emphasized the industry's role in the sustainable construction revolution, stating, \"There is more interest than ever in finding a way to reduce CO2 emissions. Carbon Limit gives the concrete and cement industry the power to be a critical part of the sustainable construction revolution and lead the way to climate resilience.\" This article was produced with assistance from OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture.","filter_flag":1}

HARMAN retrofitted the more than 107,000 sq ft manufacturing facility to enable HARMAN to heat and cool the facility with geothermal energy by using a water-to-water heat pump. Furthermore, electricity for the entire facility will be sourced by onsite solar PV panels in 2024. The activities to lower the manufacturing environmental impact in P\u00e9cs are guided by HARMAN\u2019s bold target to be carbon neutral by 2040. This includes waste reduction efforts in manufacturing operations, 100% of HARMAN\u2019s manufacturing electricity to be sourced from renewable energy sources, and an overall reduction of electricity consumption in operations by 15%. \u201cOver the past six years, the Martin brand put into production more than 20 major LED lighting product SKUs with more new products being announced soon, and it is imperative that we not only create more space to meet demand but do so responsibly and in line with our corporate goals,\u201d said Brian Divine, President, HARMAN Professional Solutions. \u201cThe completion of this project is another proof point to our customers that we produce reliable products in technologically advanced facilities while doing so with reduced impact to our environment.\u201d Prior to the move, HARMAN Professional shared factory space with HARMAN Automotive in P\u00e9cs. The growth of the two businesses units led to the decision to retrofit a three-story standalone facility for HARMAN Professional that includes production, warehouse, technical services, and a new contemporary office environment - all contained in one building. \u201cThis was an ambitious project because we set out to design, renovate and move facilities in eight months while conforming to HARMAN\u2019s high construction and sustainability standards without interruption to production,\u201d said Wolfgang Heitmann, Vice President, Supply Chain and Operations, HARMAN. \u201cThe combined contributions of people throughout company and the 300 HARMAN employees in the new building led to the success of this project which is a model for future builds that will lead us to achieving our carbon neutrality goals over the next decade. We\u2019re very proud of the example we\u2019re setting for the industry.\u201d To learn more about HARMAN\u2019s Sound Purpose: Driving Cause with Impact program, visit the latest Sustainability Report at https:\/\/www.harman.com\/sustainability.

EIT Food is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union, and research, based on a survey of nearly 10,000 consumers from 18 European countries, found that 67% said they would use such a label, while just 13% felt they would be unlikely to do so. Label greenwashing The research comes on the back of a special label greenwashing and what it means to eat \u2018clean\u2019 report on ConfectioneryNews\u200b - and has been released to mark the launch of the new Consumer Observatory. Part of EIT Food, the Consumer Observatory aims to bring together the breadth of consumer insights and knowledge from the world\u2019s largest food innovation community. While there are currently no internationally agreed standards for environmental sustainability labelling and no agreement on what sustainable production should measure, authorities are discussing the development of a common eco-label that would inform consumers about the impact that food products have on the climate and society. The research found that almost two-thirds of Europeans - 63% - believe food brands pretend their products are more sustainable than they really are, while only a third of Europeans, 33%, believe their government is transparent about regulating sustainability labels on food. Klaus Grunert, Professor at Denmark\u2019s Aarhus University and Director of the EIT Food Consumer Observatory, said: \u201cIn a world where there are over 450 sustainability logos in operation, many companies use green claims and eco-labels to help market their products. But currently, there is no universal standard for these labels, leaving many consumers confused by all the different symbols and logos on the market\u200b. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from our research that consumers want to be better informed about the environmental footprint of their food and that there is widespread support for a universal, independent and factually substantiated label for sustainable food products. Introducing such a label - and ensuring that all eco-labels include clear and concise information - could be the best way to empower consumers to make informed choices about how what they eat impacts the planet\u200b.\u201d Among the 18 countries surveyed, Italy, Spain and Poland were those with the highest levels of support for such a label, with 81%, 79% and 78% of consumers respectively saying they would use it, while Czech consumers are the least supportive (45%). In Turkey, 40% of consumers said they would be \u201cvery likely\u201d to use it. The recyclability of the packaging, animal welfare, and pollution and the use of chemicals and fertilisers were the areas that consumers most wanted to see covered by an eco-label, with 90%, 89% and 88% of consumers saying they would like to see these respective elements. The research also found: Consumers in the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Romania are particularly distrustful of their governments, with just 21%, 24% and 27% respectively saying they believe they are transparent about regulating ecolabels on food. Women are more sceptical of government than men: just 31% felt they were transparent when regulating eco-labels compared to 36% of male respondents. The Netherlands, Germany and Ireland are the countries where people have the least trust in food brands\u2019 green claims, with 73%, 69% and 69% of consumers respectively saying they believe they pretend their products are more sustainable than they are. Commenting on the launch, Sofia Kuhn, Director of Public Engagement at EIT Food, said: \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture: the food system must be transformed if we are to succeed in ensuring it can deliver healthy, sustainable food for all. In the Consumer Observatory, a crucial forum now exists to help realise this aim within Europe, putting consumer insights at the forefront. The knowledge the Consumer Observatory gathers into consumer behaviours will be available to food systems actors to help reach the shared goal of driving forward a healthier and more sustainable food system.\u201d\u200b","filter_flag":1}

Food and beverage brands are launching upcycled foods and promoting their product to consumers. Little is known about how consumers respond to upcycled foods, nor how these products can be most effectively promoted. To better understand marketing strategies for upcycled foods, two studies were conducted, one online ( n = 300) and one in retail stores ( n = 65), in New Zealand to examine differences in consumer sentiment toward upcycled beer. In both studies, environmental benefits were identified as the most important benefits of upcycled foods and information provision on pack and online were important promotional strategies. Consumers reported greater awareness and acceptance of upcycled food in-store, yet raised concerns relating to taste and price. Only 31% of participants surveyed in-store associated \u2018no negatives\u2019 with upcycled foods compared with 47% of consumers surveyed online. These findings help differentiate a potential promotion strategy for upcycled foods. 1. Introduction Food waste is a significant issue, causing negative impacts on both the environment and the economy. Across the globe, $1 trillion of food is wasted every year (1). Twenty-eight percent of agricultural land is used to grow food that is never eaten (2), and in New Zealand, approximately 571,000 tons of food go to landfill each year (3). This food, produced for human consumption, if diverted at the right time and in the right way, could be retained in the food supply chain. Given that food waste is a major global problem, many solutions to this problem have been proposed. While an extensive review of all the solutions to food waste is beyond the scope of this research, we focus on a relatively new but promising solution, i.e., upcycling. Upcycling is a partial solution to the global food waste problem, and a group known as the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) established in October 2019 is working to co-ordinate the upcycled food sector by defining upcycled food products and designing a certification for these products. The definition for upcycled foods proposed by the UFA is: \u201cUpcycled foods use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment\u201d (2). The predicted potential value of the upcycled food industry is estimated to be $46.7 billion and has an expected compound annual growth rate of 5% over the next 6 years (4). This demonstrates that while food upcycling can be positive economically, the sector also has the potential to create jobs and focus on the production of healthy foods (5), offering customers more sustainable food choices. Further, there is an emerging body of literature that investigates the commercial potential of upcycled foods (6\u201318). This stream of research has inquired into many aspects of consumer acceptance of upcycled foods. These aspects range from consumers\u2019 awareness about upcycled foods to their willingness to pay for such foods. These findings suggest a preliminary acceptance of upcycled foods by consumers and point to the need for more research on this topic. The current research is inspired in part by the promise of upcycled foods to alleviate the food waste problem and in part by the findings indicating consumer interest in sustainable food consumption. While the existing literature on upcycled foods is encouraging (5\u201321), equally noteworthy is research on consumer perceptions of how their food consumption impacts the environment. The International Food Information Council (IFIC) survey in 2021 found that 42% of participants believe their food and beverage purchasing decisions can (moderately (~24%) or significantly (~18%)) impact the environment, and amongst participants who believe their decisions have a significant impact on the environment, two in three recognize the environment as a key purchase driver. Purchasing from businesses and companies that have aligning value sets, especially concerning action to mitigate environmental and social issues is a mechanism for consumers to make their consumption more sustainable (22). The Colmar Burton Better Futures Survey for 2020 showed that 70% of New Zealanders are looking for claims\/labels to help them identify more sustainable choices and 67% want to make eco-conscious decisions, even if they cost more (23), and the IFIC 2021 survey found that for 53% of participants, a greater understanding of the impact of their purchases would influence their purchasing decisions (see text footnote 1). Given that consumers are sensitive toward the environmental impact of their consumption, it is not surprising that the food and beverage industry is responding to this trend. Food and beverage manufacturers are exploring opportunities to offer more sustainable products to consumers that reduce food waste and associated emissions by upcycling food waste into ingredients and finished foods. One such company is Citizen Collective, based in New Zealand. Citizen Collective uses surplus bread to produce craft beer, and the spent grain from making beer is then utilized to create artisan bread, thus creating a closed-loop system. To produce the beer, surplus bread is processed into croutons which replace 25% of the malt and the fermentable starch is extracted from the croutons. The flour for the artisan bread is created by drying and milling the bread-brew mash and replaces 15% of the regular flour in the loaves. Bread is the most wasted food by New Zealand households, costing New Zealanders NZD 62.5 million annually and amounting to 9.6% of all \u2018avoidable\u2019 food waste at a household level (24). Upcycling provides a solution for consumers to help reduce food waste by altering their purchasing decisions. While the effort by Citizen Collective is in the right direction, the commercial success of their product(s) is largely dependent on how well consumers accept such non-traditional products. Only 10% of consumers surveyed in a recent New Zealand study reported awareness of upcycling (19). Aschemann-Witzel and Peschel (20) suggest that it is important to \u201cpre-test\u201d new food products, including upcycled food products via soft launches and in-store tastings. Grasso and Asioli (14) also recommend that research be carried out using real products in the field (i.e., in supermarkets). Most consumer research on upcycled food to date has been conducted using online survey only (10, 12, 14\u201319, 25) yet in-store surveys present the advantage of having someone there not only to promote the product but also to discuss the concept of upcycled foods with consumers (20). This study sought to inform effective promotional strategies for upcycled craft beer by examining differences in consumer sentiment toward upcycled craft beer when the product was presented in the retail store compared to an online environment. While the studies were conducted with upcycled craft beer and are exploratory in nature, several of the findings can be generalized across upcycled food and beverages of different types. 2. Methods Given the nascent state of literature on this topic, there was a need to employ exploratory research methods. The researchers used non-probabilistic sampling and an exploratory lens in order to uncover some basic insights as to consumers\u2019 acceptance of upcycled craft beer. Accordingly, a survey with both open-ended and closed- ended questions was developed. The initial survey was developed by the researchers in collaboration with Citizen Collective and pre-tested with customers in three retail stores on the 22nd and 23rd of January 2021. The survey was refined as a result of participant and researcher feedback. These changes reduced the average response time from four-and-a-half minutes to one-and-a-half minutes. The final survey was then administered via two mechanisms (1) in-store and (2) online, to understand consumer sentiment toward upcycled craft beer. As noted above, executing the survey both online and in-store allowed for triangulation of results and improved confidence in the findings. Next, we describe the process of data collection in both the online and in-store environments before reporting the results. 2.1. In-store survey In-store sampling and surveying introduced consumers to upcycled beer at seven full-scale retail stores (New World and PAK\u2019nSAVE) operated by a large New Zealand retailer Foodstuffs. Research was undertaken in two major cities (Auckland and Wellington, the two cities with the greatest proportion of stores selling upcycled craft beer) in February 2021. The researchers worked with the Merchandise Management team at Foodstuffs to recruit stores as research sites in these locations. To provide the customers with a true in-store experience, Citizen staff conducted the sampling and discussed the product with customers and a researcher accompanied the Citizen team to administer the survey. A tasting station was set up in the craft beer section of the store and the research team invited shoppers who entered the craft beer area and sampled the beer to participate in the survey. Prior to offering samples photo identification was sought to determine that all participants were aged over eighteen and legally allowed to be served alcohol. During product tasting, Citizen staff educated the customer about the product, including a verbal summary of the product manufacturing process. This summary informed customers that the craft beer was made from surplus bread sourced from supermarkets, and the spent grain from the beer-making process was converted back into artisan bread; a process known as upcycling. Customers who sampled the beer were then invited to complete a short survey. The survey included six questions covering general selection criteria for craft beer, prior awareness of upcycled foods, perceived benefits and concerns associated with upcycled foods, appeal of upcycled craft beer compared to conventional craft beer and factors that would aid future purchasing decisions concerning upcycled foods (see Supplementary Table 1). In order to emulate a true in-store sampling experience, of which a core component is hearing about the story of the product from the producer and what makes this product different from others on the market, customers were informed of the upcycled nature of the product prior to undertaking the survey. To overcome potential bias when gauging consumer awareness of upcycled foods in the survey the question was worded \u201cHave you ever heard of upcycled foods before today?\u201d The temporal reference in this question was included in order to focus the respondent on prior awareness. These conditions were replicated in the online survey format in the form of a contextual paragraph about the product at the beginning of the survey (see Section 2.2). The survey took approximately one-and-a-half minutes to complete, and shoppers were free to decline to answer any questions in the survey. Sixty-five shoppers participated in the in-store survey (n = 65). Ethics approval was gained from the University of Otago Ethics Committee (Ref No: 20-09B) in December 2020. Included in the approval of the Ethics application were the survey questions, survey protocol, Participant Consent Form and Participant Information Sheet. 2.2. Online survey The survey was then replicated online in March 2021 using an online platform called Yabble and was conducted according to the code of ethics for the Research Association of New Zealand. In March 2021, PAK\u2019nSAVE and New World panels were used to administer the same survey to craft beer consumers. Shoppers who did not purchase craft beer were excluded through a vetting question at the beginning of the survey \u201cDo you purchase craft beer from New World or PAK\u2019nSAVE supermarkets?\u201d If respondents answered \u2018yes\u2019 they were able to proceed to the survey. If respondents answered \u2018no\u2019, the survey did not progress. Three hundred consumers answered \u2018yes\u2019 and completed the online survey (n = 300), participants were entered into a prize draw to win one of four $50 New World or PAK\u2019nSAVE gift cards. While there was no live sampling, the online survey participants were provided with a short blurb and a photo of Citizen Beer before they begun the survey to mimic the information provided to participants surveyed in store: \u201cCitizen beer is a new craft beer that takes surplus bread from supermarkets, like New World and PAK\u2019nSAVE and turns this into craft beer, this process is known as upcycling.\u201d 2.3. Analysis Data from the surveys were exported from Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) and imported into Microsoft Excel. Descriptive statistics were undertaken to determine the percentage of participants in the online sample and the in-store sample that selected each multi-choice answer. A test of two proportions was then undertaken to understand whether there were statistically significant differences between responses of participants surveyed in-store and participants surveyed online. A value of p < 0.05 was selected as the threshold for a statistically significant difference between samples due to the small sample size. 3. Results Of the in-store sample, 69% percent of participants were male. The largest proportion of participants were aged 18\u201334 (42% of participants), with the smallest representation in the over 65 years category (6% of participants). Of the online sample, 58% of participants were male, and the largest proportion of participants were aged 35\u201354 (45% of participants), with the smallest representation aged 18\u201334 (12 percent of participants) (Table 1). TABLE 1 Table 1. Demographic variables of participants surveyed in-store and online (n = 365). In setting the context for the survey, participants were asked about the aspects they found important when selecting craft beer. Irrespective of whether customers were surveyed in-store or online, the most important three attributes identified were taste, price, and Country of Origin (New Zealand made). Next, inferential tests (z tests) were conducted to determine whether there were significant differences between the two samples (online vs. in-store) on key attributes of upcycled craft beer. A z-test revealed that significantly more participants surveyed in-store identified taste (z = 2.20, p < 0 0.05), sustainability (z = 5.89, p < 0.01), and company ethics (z = 5.13, p < 0.01) as important attributes compared to participants surveyed online (see Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Important attributes for consumers when selecting craft beer. Asterisk shows significant differences between the in-store and online categories (p < 0.05). The survey then sought to understand customer awareness for upcycled foods. Accordingly, a z-test was conducted to test the difference in consumer awareness of upcycled foods between the two samples (online vs. in-store). Overall, a greater proportion of participants surveyed in-store reported being aware of upcycled foods prior to participating in the survey compared to participants in the online survey (43% in-store vs. 27% online; z = 2.57; p < 0.05; Figure 2). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Awareness of consumers regarding the term \u2018upcycled food\u2019 before survey date. After gauging the importance of craft beer attributes and awareness of upcycling in foods, the survey proceeded to assess the benefits that customers sought from upcycled foods (see Supplementary Table 1). The top three benefits consumers associated with upcycled foods were the same whether participants were surveyed in-store or online. These benefits were the potential for upcycled foods to reduce food waste (98% in-store, 96% online), that they may be more sustainable (78% in-store, 60% online) and that they may reduce the carbon footprint of a product (66% in-store, 50% online). Again, z-tests were conducted to test differences between the two samples. Significantly more participants who were surveyed in-store identified the benefit of upcycled foods as being more sustainable (78%, z = 2.80, p < 0 0.01), that they reduce carbon footprint (66%, z = 2.37, p < 0.05), and their ability to increase social status (11%, z = 2.23, p < 0.05) compared to those surveyed online. On the other hand, significantly more participants who were surveyed online found nutritional benefits (37%, z = \u22124.10, p < 0.01) and the ability of upcycled foods to help producers earn more money (48%, z = \u22124.8271, p < 0.01) as important compared to those surveyed in-store. The proportions for all the benefit appeals are reported in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Perceived benefits that consumers associated with upcycled foods. Asterisk shows significant differences between the in-store and online categories (p < 0.05). The survey then asked consumers to think about potential concerns associated with upcycled foods (see Figure 5). The researchers tested for differences between the two samples on this measure using z-tests. Of those surveyed in-store, significantly more (35%, z = 2.90, p < 0.01) participants were concerned as to whether the upcycled food product would taste good, compared to those surveyed online (19%). Also in-store, concern as to whether the product would be expensive was identified by 34% of participants, more so than when surveyed online (13%, z = 4.08, p < 0.01), and whether the product would be of good quality was a concern identified by 30% of participants. When surveyed online, 47% of participants believed there were no negatives associated with upcycled food products, significantly more than those surveyed in-store (31%) (z = \u22122.39, p < 0.05). Only 12% of in-store participants and 18% of online participants highlighted food safety as a potential negative associated with upcycled foods. When surveyed in-store, 79% of consumers identified that an upcycled craft beer was either \u2018a little more\u2019 or \u2018a lot more appealing\u2019 than a conventional craft beer (51\/65 consumers) (see Figure 4). When surveyed online, only 54% of consumers identified that an upcycled craft beer was either \u2018a little more\u2019 or \u2018a lot more appealing\u2019 than a conventional craft beer. Like other measures, z-tests were conducted to assess differences between the two samples. Regarding participants who found upcycled craft beer \u2018a lot more appealing\u2019 than conventional craft beer, there was a statistically significant difference (Z = 3.01, p < 0.01) between respondents surveyed in-store (31%) and online (15%). Also, statistically significantly more (Z = \u22122.94, p < 0.01) participants surveyed online (41%) deemed upcycled beer as no more or less appealing, compared with 21% of those surveyed online. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Appeal of upcycled craft beer to consumers compared with conventional craft beer. It is particularly important to note that no participants identified upcycled craft beer as less appealing than conventional craft beer in the in-store survey. In the online survey, just 5% of participants identified upcycled craft beer as less appealing than conventional craft beer. Participants surveyed in-store identified clearly highlighting on the packaging that the product is upcycled as the most important tool in encouraging uptake of upcycled craft beer, whereas, for those participants surveyed online, price was the most important enabler (see Figure 6). Price (56%, z = \u22125.49, p < 0.01), a dedicated upcycled area in-store (29%, z = \u22122.52, p < 0.05) and a third party upcycled endorsement (22%, z = \u22122.35, p < 0.05) were identified as important promotional tools by more of those surveyed online than in-store (see summary of results in Supplementary Table 2). 4. Discussion Food waste continues to be a major challenge across the globe even when millions of people are experiencing food insecurity. Hence, research has focused on finding solutions to this pernicious problem. Of these, upcycling is a solution that tackles food waste early in the food supply chain and is therefore a better solution than composting or feeding surplus food to animals (8, 9). While intuitive, upcycling as a concept is new to the food and beverage industry. Despite their economic and environmental benefits, upcycled foods can be successful in alleviating the food waste problem only if they are widely accepted by consumers. This research was conducted to contribute to the small but growing literature on consumer acceptance of upcycled foods (6\u201321). Findings from this research contain several insights for better marketing of upcycled foods. Increasing consumer awareness for upcycled products may be the first frontier. Previous studies which have attempted to understand consumer awareness of upcycled foods have asked consumers of their previous knowledge of the term \u2018upcycled\u2019 before describing the term to participants. In these studies, only 10% of New Zealand consumers surveyed in 2020 (19) and 15% of UK consumers surveyed by Grasso and Asioli in 2020 (14) reported prior awareness of upcycled foods. Studies, such as Coderoni and Perito (12, 21) which provided consumers with a description of the process of making food from by-products before asking about prior awareness of upcycled foods have found a higher awareness rate (81% in the 2019 study and 85% in the 2021 study). The present study employed the same approach, describing the process of creating beer from surplus bread to illustrate the concept before asking respondents about their prior awareness of this concept, resulting in 27% of those surveyed online and 43% of those surveyed in-store (Figure 1) reporting previous awareness of upcycled food. The increase in consumer awareness in this study and other studies which describe the concept of upcycling prior to gauging awareness compared to studies which present the term without context illustrates that overall perhaps consumers have greater awareness of the concept of upcycling, but lower awareness of the term. Therefore, producers of upcycled foods should consider presenting context when using the term upcycling to trigger recognition with consumers. Using a consistent definition, for example the definition proposed by the Upcycled Food Association (2), could be one way to achieve this, the consistency in the definition is important to reinforce the meaning of the term to consumers. In the present study, consumers reported both greater awareness of the concept of upcycled food (Figure 2) and greater acceptance (Figure 4) in an in-store environment, compared to those surveyed online. Therefore, messaging to further raise awareness for upcycled foods may be effectively positioned in-store where overall interest in such products is heightened, and where it is possible to interact and engage with consumers. Point-of-sale messaging of suboptimal foods to increase acceptance and awareness was also identified by Aschemann-Witzel et al. (25) to be effective in communicating these foods to customers. A promising finding from this research was that 47% of those surveyed online and 31% surveyed in-store identified no negatives with upcycled foods (Figure 5). Of the list of possible concerns provided, concern for product quality was evident amongst those surveyed online and those surveyed in-store. Such concerns, which are natural with new products, are especially pertinent for edible products that impact one\u2019s well-being more directly. Upcycled beer manufacturers will need to devise a strategy to assure consumers of the quality of their craft beer using appropriate marketing communications. Providing the opportunity to sample the product in-store did not appear to influence consumer concerns about quality. Awareness and assurance must be the key elements of the marketing strategy around this new product. Whether the product would taste good and whether the product would be more expensive were named as concerns by significantly more consumers surveyed in-store compared to those surveyed online. This is an interesting finding considering consumers were offered the opportunity to taste the product, and the price information was available in-store. Those surveyed online were not provided the price information nor the opportunity to taste, which may provide an explanation as to why those concerns were not top of mind. In contrast, significantly more consumers surveyed online raised price as an important promotional strategy for upcycled foods compared to those surveyed in-store (Figure 6). While the concerns need to be dealt with, there is a silver lining in the survey findings. Many consumers indicated potential benefits from consuming these products. Irrespective of whether consumers were surveyed online or in-store, benefits relating to environmental outcomes were identified as important by the greatest proportion of consumers (Figure 3); such a finding was also reported by Grasso and Asioli (14) in their case study of consumer acceptance of upcycled biscuits conducted in the UK. Positioning implications derived from careful consideration of these environmental benefits will be useful for building a promotional strategy for upcycled beer. Regardless of being surveyed in-store or online consumers identified that information on the product packaging and information online relating to the upcycled attributes and development of the product were important promotional strategies (Figure 6). Peschel and Aschemann-Witzel (17) also found that greater transparency concerning the communication of sustainability benefits of upcycled foods was associated with increased consumer likelihood to opt for an upcycled product (considered without the context of price) and that information provision about the process of upcycling can increase consumer attitudes toward these products (20). This result was particularly evident in \u201cvice\u201d or discretionary products, of which beer is. The present study uncovers suggestions about how the upcycled beer can be promoted (Figure 6). As with many new products, consumers are apprehensive at first due to concerns relating to quality and benefits of the new product (11). However, the role of marketing in overcoming the concerns and shaping consumer acceptance is key (11). From the results of this case study, it is evident that point-of-sale communications to build transparency about upcycled beer will likely aid in further developing consumer awareness and acceptance of the product. Promotional strategies should leverage environmental motivators and allay concerns about product quality. Comparability of pricing between upcycled products and conventional products was also a concern yet was highlighted as an opportunity that can be realized as part of a promotional strategy. While the commercial success of upcycled craft beer remains to be seen, this research provides useful directions for developing promotional strategies to increase consumer acceptance. FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Potential negatives that consumers associated with upcycled foods. Asterisk shows significant differences between the in-store and online categories (p < 0.05). FIGURE 6 Figure 6. Promotional factors that would encourage consumers to purchase an upcycled craft beer over conventional craft beer. Asterisk shows significant differences between the in-store and online categories (Indicates p < 0.05). There were however limitations to the study, which include the unmatched demographics between the in-store survey population and the online survey population. As the demographics are not directly comparable, this should be considered when interpreting the results. The samples were also not matched by size, due to the short data collection window for in-store sampling, constrained by store availability for taste-testing sessions. It was only possible to undertake 65 surveys in-store, to increase the total sample population additional participants were recruited to participate in the online survey. Another limitation of the study was that the survey was multi-choice and therefore participants were required to choose from the answers provided which may not have represented their views accurately, as the in-store surveys were conducted on i-Pads it was decided that the addition of free text questions was not practical. There were however strengths to the study, which attempted to understand consumer sentiments to upcycled food in an in-store environment, in contrast to many consumer studies which conduct online surveys only. 5. Conclusion and recommendations Four key conclusions and recommendations resulted from the study: 1. In general consumer awareness of upcycled foods should be increased and this could be done in a variety of ways, by promotion and sampling of products in-store, through claims on-pack (19), by providing information online (19), or through product certification (10, 19). 2. It is important for an agreed definition to be used so as not to confuse consumers. If we want consumers to be able to quickly recognize and value upcycled foods, the concept must be communicated clearly. 3. Future work could include sensory analysis of selected upcycled food products with consumers, before and after providing the definition of upcycled foods, to see if information provision can affect their sensory perception. 4. Future research may also provide consumers with a range of upcycled products to compare and contrast their attributes. In the meantime, upcycled food manufacturers can use these insights to inform their future promotional strategies, which may now place increased focus on in-store product demonstrations and go forward with a reaffirmed confidence demonstrated by the positive consumer sentiments demonstrated in this New Zealand case study.

In 2022, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) made 13 predictions in \u201cThe Future of Food Production\u201d report covering the next 10 years. They include changing farm ownership models, increased global production demand, reducing environmental impact, geographic shifts in production, developing artificial intelligence, and narrowing the connectivity gap. At the convergence of all these trends, AEM predicts new business models will emerge in the agriculture machinery industry. Curt Blades, senior vice president of AEM, points specifically to changes in farm ownership as one of the biggest trends driving the emergence of new business models, citing data from the 2014 USDA Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land survey. At that time, 39% of U.S. farmland was rented, increasing to 54% for land used for crop production. This trend has continued since 2014. Looking specifically at Iowa, the amount of Iowa farmland leased out increased from 53% in 2017 to 58% in 2022, according to data from Iowa State University\u2019s Iowa Farmland Ownership and Tenure Survey. \u201cThe business structure has evolved a little bit with less direct ownership of farmland,\u201d says Blades. \u201cAs a result, whether you\u2019re in ag equipment or inputs, you have to match that business model with what the farmer\u2019s using.\u201d Subscriptions in the marketplace Equipment manufacturers look to \u201cequipment as a service,\u201d a model used predominantly outside of North America until this point as a possible payment model alongside subscription services. This would allow farmers to lease equipment for a specified period, with payment based on the output of that equipment, along with any other services that go along with it, such as data analytics and preventive maintenance, according to AEM\u2019s report. Blades likens this to custom harvesting practices. \u201c\u2018Equipment as a service\u2019 is kind of tailor-made for high-concentration small farms,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t really exist here in the U.S., but you could certainly see where it would apply nicely to a small farm because they just wouldn\u2019t need to have that capital expense.\u201d Hardware, until very recently, has always been a one-time buy, says Jim Chambers, senior vice president and general manager of Trimble Agriculture. Farmers would buy the receivers and then pay different unlock fees depending on the accuracy required for their equipment. Costs would be relatively expensive, but the hardware was the owner\u2019s for the lifetime of that technology. To get higher accuracy and additional features, owners of Trimble equipment needed an annual subscription. Instead of paying for the hardware entirely upfront, Trimble is starting to offer subscription agreements, providing a cheaper entry point comparable to a cell phone plan, according to Chambers. \u201cYou could turn it off at any point you don\u2019t need it or if we\u2019re not meeting your needs,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cIt forces us to be better suppliers because we have to earn your business over and over again.\u201d John Deere has offered subscription services for precision ag tools such as RTK guidance signals, following a time-based model. Deere plans to expand its service offerings with time-based and usage-based pricing models, according to Joel Dawson, director of production and precision ag marketing at John Deere. \u201cThese \u2018solutions as a service\u2019 not only minimize upfront costs for farmers but also continually enhance their effectiveness, allowing them to pay only for what their farm needs,\u201d says Dawson. Case IH has yet to launch any machines under the \u201cequipment as a service\u201d model. The company will continue to evaluate business models as technology hardware costs increase and market conditions change, with the goal of making its machinery cost-effective, notes Chris Dempsey, global director of precision technology at Case IH. Determining pricing models Telematics aren\u2019t new to agriculture, so there is a fair amount of market expectations from competitors and related industries driving price positioning, says Dempsey. \u201cThe other factor is anytime we bring new products to market or consider pricing adjustments, those are largely based on customer feedback, and a group of customers we work fairly closely with to have those conversations,\u201d says Dempsey. John Deere approaches pricing by analyzing the competitive landscape, and considering the pricing of alternative options available in the market, says Dawson. \u201cOur chosen pricing strategy is geared toward facilitating a rapid return on investment for farmers to improve their profitability,\u201d says Dawson. Largely precision ag and telematics subscription services are offered on a machine-by-machine basis, but in some instances dealers might combine services to encompass fleets or multiple-unit packages for unique requirements from the farmer. Maintaining uptime During critical points while planting or harvesting, any amount of downtime can affect a farmer\u2019s bottom line. While most of these subscription-based services require a data connection for full function, it isn\u2019t always necessary for access. \u201cThe data is always logged in the display or in the architecture onboard the tractor, combine, or any connected piece,\u201d says Dempsey. \u201cWhen it regains connectivity, it will send the relevant data that has been logged during periods of outage.\u201d Access to timely customer service is just as important. Deere and its network of dealers have used an internal administration tool for a number of years that the company is enhancing with new features. \u201cEstablishing a robust infrastructure is critical in effectively overseeing the intricate facets of subscriptions,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential element in guaranteeing a favorable experience for all stakeholders involved.\u201d Chambers says, in the past two years, Trimble has invested \u201cmassive amounts of money\u201d for the company\u2019s digital transformation across its entire portfolio to prepare for the future. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging transportation, geospatial, and construction to build one common infrastructure to operate within that allows us to monitor our customers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can know how they\u2019re using our products, and we\u2019re able to provide the latest and greatest insight, and make sure we\u2019ve got all the content needed however you want to access it. Do you want to text somebody? Talk to somebody? Do you want to just go on the Trimble site and read a document yourself? All of those options are available.\u201d Precision for small farms Precision technology is pouring into the machinery marketplace at a faster rate than farmers can purchase new equipment. Historically, advanced technology was initially adopted by farmers with large operations, often leaving smaller ones unable to justify the investment due to scale limitations. \u201cThis highlights a key advantage of our \u2018solutions as a service\u2019 approach,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cOur solution incurs a lower upfront cost, making it feasible for small-sized farms to embrace technology. This approach ensures accessibility for all farmers, allowing them to integrate evolving technology at their own pace and pay only for the features their farm requires.\u201d Deere has entered the retrofit market for similar reasons. \u201cWhile we value selling new equipment, we also emphasize the sale of technology that enhances the intelligence and precision of existing machinery,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cThis commitment ensures advancements in technology benefit all farmers, regardless of their equipment\u2019s age.\u201d Case IH has made retrofitting the company\u2019s own machinery and mixed fleets one of its primary objectives, according to Dempsey. CNH Industrial\u2019s recent acquisition of Raven Industries has further accelerated the company\u2019s presence in the aftermarket. AEM is also working to ensure farmers can afford access to the financial and environmental benefits this technology can provide to their farms. The organization supports two pieces of bipartisan legislation \u2014 the Precision Agriculture Loan Program Act and the PRECISE Act \u2014 allowing for funds to be used to upgrade equipment to include precision agriculture, which Blades hopes will be included in the upcoming farm bill. Manufacturer interoperability \"Most farmers have a mixed-fleet environment of machines and implements, even if they\u2019re predominantly one color,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cAs we\u2019re moving forward, we\u2019re moving a lot more technology off the tractor and onto the implement.\u201d Trimble, which recently entered a joint venture with AGCO, is still focused on servicing mixed fleets, with 40% of its agriculture business sold directly to OEMs and installed at the factory, and the other 60% sold in the aftermarket from a variety of dealers. \u201cTrimble\u2019s goal is to be this open environment,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cYou could be an independent OEM and you can still brand our tech whatever brand you\u2019ve got, but behind the scenes, it\u2019s Trimble\u2019s system, Trimble\u2019s data structure, making it easier to bring all the farmer\u2019s data together.\u201d AEM has worked closely with the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) over the years to improve cross-manufacturer compatibility and implement international standards for electronic and electric components like ISOBUS equipment. As telematics services and precision ag technology have entered the market, data compatibility is becoming increasingly important. AEM regularly meets with AgGateway with the mission of developing the \u201cresources and relationships that drive digital connectivity in global agriculture and related industries,\u201d according to the group\u2019s website. \u201cWe have a little ways to go on both of those two fronts, but we\u2019re certainly all committed to making sure that it works,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThere\u2019s a three-way memorandum of understanding between AgGateway, AEM, and AEF to work together on data and hardware interoperability.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Since then, the European Union has issued a flurry of regulations applying environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards to trade. These measures are expected to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions, protect greener European producers from unfair competition, and discourage bad trade practices. Their greatest economic impact, however, will likely be felt not in the EU but in emerging markets. Few companies and governments in developing nations are prepared for what is about to hit them. In the absence of a real sense of urgency, concrete actions, and multilateral cooperation, many are in jeopardy of being shut out of their key export markets. Two of the most significant EU measures relate to climate. One is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will soon place the same price on carbon emissions associated with materials produced in developing nations\u2014including steel, aluminum, and chemicals\u2014that producers in the EU now pay. The other is the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which bans the sale of commodities such as cocoa, coffee, palm oil, and timber harvested from recently cleared rainforest. This will affect important export industries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Taken together, these and other climate- and values-based measures amount to one of the biggest changes to global trade since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. They will eventually affect virtually every significant emerging-market export sector. Emerging-market companies and governments must act now. The measures needed to remain competitive in Europe and in markets that adopt similar ESG rules can\u2019t be implemented overnight. If they haven\u2019t done so already, companies need to establish systems for documenting and reporting the greenhouse gas footprints and other data relating to their products and supply chains. And rather than merely react to new requirements as they arise, companies should adopt \u201csmart compliance\u201d\u2014a pragmatic approach to fulfilling mandatory disclosure requirements. Companies also need a holistic strategy and game plan for decarbonizing and for improving their overall ESG performance. The Growing Sustainability Imperative The movement to get companies to adhere to ESG standards has been gaining momentum in advanced economies for decades. Now, the sustainability movement is hitting emerging markets at full force. These nations, which by 2050 are expected to account for 62% of the global economy and 88% of the population, are crucial to mitigating climate change. Although they emit less CO2 per capita than advanced economies, they account for around 85% of the global total\u2014a share that\u2019s projected to grow. Emerging-market companies are under intensifying pressure, not just from the demands of their trade partners, but from consumers, investors, regulators, and employees at home and abroad to back their commitments with verifiable action.

Yet many organizations are not delivering. In our Build for the Future research, approximately 80% of companies aspire to be sustainability leaders in the next three years, but less than 5% are systematically implementing advanced use cases to generate sustainability and societal benefits. Leading companies create a competitive advantage from sustainability in two major ways: Making the core sustainable. First, they innovate and transform their existing organization, operations (to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions), and supply chain (Scope 3 emissions) to reduce their environmental impact and become more inclusive. In doing so, these companies mitigate risks to their business from climate-related disruptions, increased regulation, and other factors, becoming more resilient even as they reduce costs. For example, IKEA is shifting its business model to become fully circular across a range of initiatives by 2030. Furniture designs now emphasize renewable materials and recycled contents, with products that are built to be more durable and repairable. Driving new sustainable growth. Sustainability leaders also grow by innovating their business model, developing new offerings, and acquiring green businesses. Schneider Electric developed a new platform called EcoStruxure, which includes connected products and sensors, control hubs, apps, analytics, and services, all aimed at helping customers measure and improve their sustainability performance. Since launch, the platform has been deployed in almost 500,000 sites and now connects more than 1 billion devices, according to the company. Schneider Electric\u2019s sustainability transformation has seen the company triple in size, growing from \u20ac9 billion in 2003 to \u20ac34 billion in revenues in 2022.

What separates these future-built companies? We have analyzed the differences and developed a Build for the Future framework.

According to a survey by Nestl\u00e9 Professional, 60% of consumers in caf\u00e9s are trying plant-based milk for the first time. The category is expected to grow by 23% in sales, according to another survey published in October by Scanntech. The club aims to strengthen the bond between the company and baristas through a group that offers professionals exclusive experiences and specialized knowledge. Guests will have access to tasting events, sponsored TNTs (Latte Art contests) by the startup itself, a monthly newsletter with content related to the theme, and surprises delivered to participants\u2019 homes. The expansion of the NotMilk range is one of the latest innovations in NotCo\u2019s portfolio, addressing experts\u2019 concerns about using plant-based milk in more technical preparations. The product offers a thick and consistent cream, froths both cold and hot, a flavor that doesn\u2019t overshadow the taste of coffee, and versatility for various preparations. It\u2019s worth noting that the innovation comes in a pure format and three variants: hot (Cappuccino), with Matcha, and cold. The two launches were officially presented at an exclusive Dela Caf\u00e9 in S\u00e3o Paulo event in October. NotMilk Barista could be tasted in three beverages harmonized with food. A Latte Art competition was also held for baristas to showcase their skills, and guests also tried making some combinations during a \u2018free bar\u2019 moment. According to Vanessa Giangiacomo, NotCo\u2019s Marketing Manager, the idea of the presentation was to show baristas that plant-based milk can take center stage in caf\u00e9 menus. \u201cThe tasting and the Latte Art challenge were proof that we are on the side of these specialists, whether encouraging them to learn new techniques with the club or launching innovations that meet their demands,\u201d explains Giangiacomo. She also emphasized that coffee is a national passion. Since the market for plant-based products is constantly growing, these professionals are essential to ensure an innovative and delicious future for the audience. \u201cThey are the ones making decisions when it comes to creating wonderful plant-based options and bringing a good variety of alternatives to lovers of this beloved drink in Brazil, as well as helping people include products without ingredients of animal origin in their daily lives,\u201d says the director. NotCo, part of the select group of unicorns, is Latin America\u2019s fastest-growing plant-based food technology company and aims to lead the global food revolution. The foodtech uses its artificial intelligence technology to map the molecular structure of animal protein foods and create original recipes that are 100% plant-based. These ensure the same taste and texture experience as the favorite dishes of Brazilians, promoting consumption that minimizes environmental impact and is responsible for the ecosystem.

In theory, chemical recycling is a promising way to deal with so-called \u201chard-to-recycle\u201d plastics like wrappers and bags, which can\u2019t be recycled using conventional methods. But a new report from the nonprofits Beyond Plastics and the International Pollutants Elimination Network, or IPEN, says chemical recycling is a \u201cdangerous deception\u201d that will only exacerbate pollution and environmental injustice while failing to address the plastics crisis. \u201cThe landscape of chemical recycling is littered with pollution and failure,\u201d and relying on it is an \u201cunreliable and polluting approach\u201d to resolve the global plastics crisis, Jennifer Congdon, Beyond Plastics\u2019 deputy director, told journalists at a press conference on Tuesday. She and the report co-authors called on President Joe Biden to place a national moratorium on new chemical recycling operations in the U.S. and urged international negotiators to disavow the process as part of the global plastics treaty that will be discussed during a third round of negotiations in Nairobi later this month. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Beyond Plastics and IPEN\u2019s 159-page report begins with an overview of the plastic pollution crisis and companies\u2019 \u201cundeniable\u201d failure to address it through conventional recycling methods. According to the Department of Energy, the U.S. plastics recycling rate is still only about 5 percent, despite decades spent trying to scale it up. Notably, this view is supported in a foreword by Lewis Freeman, former vice president of government affairs for the Society of the Plastics Industry \u2014 a major lobbying group that in 2016 changed its name to the Plastics Industry Association. According to Freeman, the plastics industry has long known that recycling \u201ccouldn\u2019t realistically manage a significant amount of plastic waste,\u201d but has \u201cspent millions of dollars convincing the public otherwise.\u201d Freeman implies that chemical recycling is an extension of this deception and raises doubts that it will contribute to an industry target of \u201creusing, recycling or recovering 100 percent of plastic packaging in the U.S. by 2040.\u201d The Plastics Industry Association did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment. To assess the state of chemical recycling in the United States, Beyond Plastics and IPEN looked at the country\u2019s 11 chemical recycling facilities and found that only three are dedicated exclusively to producing feedstocks for new plastic products; the rest produce fuel to be burned, sometimes in combination with chemicals for industrial use. Four facilities are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as generators of hazardous waste, and seven of them are located in areas where there is a higher-than-average concentration of people of color. This trend aligns with a pattern of environmental injustice within the plastics industry, which has concentrated pollution-intensive plastic production facilities near Black and low-income communities in Louisiana, Texas, and Pennsylvania. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Meanwhile, the report finds that most of the facilities are working only at a \u201cpilot\u201d or \u201cdemonstration\u201d scale and not at full capacity, despite efforts dating back to the 1980s to scale up chemical recycling technologies. Even if these 11 facilities were processing as much plastic as they say they can, Beyond Plastics and IPEN estimate they would only go through 460,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year \u2014 less than 1.3 percent of the amount generated in the U.S. annually. A crane lifts plastic trash from a landfill on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesia. Yasuyoshi Chiba \/ AFP via Getty Images These findings are consistent with those of other nonprofits and media outlets. A 2021 Reuters investigation, for example, found that 30 chemical recycling projects announced by 24 companies were either \u201cstill operating on a modest scale\u201d or had closed down, while more than half were years behind schedule. A more recent investigation into one facility in North Carolina found that much of the plastic it processed was disposed of as toxic waste, despite advertisements claiming it to be an environmental success story. \u201cThe only thing actually being recycled is the myth that recycling will solve the plastic pollution crisis,\u201d the new report says. It raises concern about a spate of state-level laws backed by the American Chemistry Council, an industry lobbying group, to promote chemical recycling, including by loosening air emissions controls and eliminating monitoring requirements. At least 20 states have passed such deregulation laws. The American Chemistry Council did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment. A spokesperson for Alterra, which operates a chemical recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, said the report was \u201criddled with many misleading and erroneous conclusions\u201d and specifically described as \u201cdefamatory\u201d the claim that its facility was nearing the limits of its air emissions permit while operating at below full capacity. The company said Beyond Plastics \u201cconveniently ignored\u201d publicly available documents from a local air quality regulator showing that its facility\u2019s emissions are \u201csignificantly below the limits of the air emissions permit.\u201d Beyond Plastics said Alterra\u2019s criticism was \u201cnot based on fact,\u201d and that the documents the company provided do not negate previous findings showing that its facility had nearly violated its air emissions permit, and that the Ohio EPA decided on two occasions not to take enforcement action against it. \u201cWe stand by our report,\u201d said Judith Enck, Beyond Plastics\u2019 president and a former regional administrator for the EPA. Another operator, Nexus Circular, sent Grist snippets of its website\u2019s FAQ page describing the chemical recycling process, and a third, ExxonMobil, said chemical recycling was a \u201cproven, scalable technology to turn plastic waste that would otherwise go to landfill or incineration into valuable new products.\u201d PureCycle, which runs a polypropylene purification plant in Ironton, Ohio, disputed Beyond Plastics\u2019 characterization of the plant\u2019s processes as chemical recycling. Six of the other seven companies whose chemical recycling facilities are named in the new report did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment. Prima America Corporation, which operates a chemical recycling facility in New Hampshire, could not be reached because it does not have a website or a publicly listed phone number. To stop greenwashing and prevent chemical recycling from further harming low-income communities and communities of color, Beyond Plastics and IPEN call for Biden to declare a moratorium on all new chemical recycling plants, a step that environmental groups have previously suggested the president can take without congressional approval. They also recommended that all existing facilities be subject to \u201cfull environmental impact assessments\u201d from the EPA. All federal, state, and local subsidies and incentives for chemical recycling should be ended, the authors said, and no projects that turn plastic into fuel should be allowed. On the international stage, countries are in the midst of negotiating a historic treaty on plastics. There\u2019s nothing in the treaty yet about chemical recycling \u2014 it\u2019s still a very rough draft \u2014 but Beyond Plastics and IPEN say it\u2019s critical that negotiators fight for language that explicitly labels it an illegitimate solution to the plastic pollution crisis, potentially by classifying it as \u201cwaste incineration\u201d rather than recycling, or by blocking it from counting toward mandatory recycling targets. The third round of negotiations is scheduled to begin on November 13, with the final treaty due by the end of next year. \u201cWe do not want the treaty negotiators \u2014 or legislators or regulators \u2014 to be distracted by the false solution of chemical recycling,\u201d Enck told journalists on Tuesday. Instead, she urged them to consider the simpler strategy of significantly reducing plastic production. This story has been updated to include Beyond Plastics\u2019 response to Alterra\u2019s criticism of the report, as well as additional comments from PureCycle. *Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that all, rather than most, of the facilities named by Beyond Plastics are operating at a pilot or demonstration scale.","filter_flag":1}

Talent: A&D companies are addressing workforce challenges amid rising demand and changing workforce expectations The A&D industry is facing a new talent landscape that is mainly driven by increasing salary levels, increased employee mobility, a reevaluation of employee relationships with the workplace, and an intensely competitive job market. Evolving employee expectations, which have only amplified since the pandemic, have often made it challenging for A&D companies to attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce. These workforce issues could prove to be a significant pain point for A&D companies as they begin to scale production operations to meet growing demand across the industry. Attracting talent The US A&D industry has surpassed prepandemic levels in terms of employment. In 2022, US-based A&D companies increased their workforce by 101,700 to 2.2 million, marking a 4.87% increase from 2021 and surpassing prepandemic 2019 levels of 2.18 million.3 Despite the rise in workforce numbers, A&D companies are likely to face talent shortages. These shortages may hamper production demands resulting from domestic travel increases and nations increasing their armament stockpiles. Currently, the industry is struggling to attract talent, ranging from technicians and manufacturers to engineers. One leading Asia-based engineering company noted that the shortage of technicians may lead to increased maintenance costs and impact fleet expansion forecasts.4 Furthermore, in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 (NAM\u2019s) 2023 third quarter manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey, about three out of four surveyed US manufacturers stated that attracting and retaining a quality workforce is their primary business challenge.5 The manufacturing industry, including A&D manufacturing, is increasingly competing with other industries for skilled talent.6 A&D companies recognize this, as top talent with digital skills can be drawn to digital jobs within a multitude of areas, including automotive (for example, the battery electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle segments) and life sciences (for example, medical technology, and biotechnology). A&D companies may need to expand their strategies beyond compensation to accommodate the changing needs of the workforce. The US A&D industry has an annual average salary of US$108,900 which is approximately 55% above the national average.7 That said, many Gen Z employees are keen to have careers with broad impact and a purpose.8 These companies may attract talent with mission-focused marketing campaigns and undertake more strategic recruitment to ensure that the values of the employees and the company align. Retaining talent Despite a significant number of new hires, job openings in the manufacturing industry were still 604,000 in August 2023.9 Additionally, quits accounted for about 68% of total separations. To compete in a tightening labor market, A&D companies will likely address both talent attraction and, potentially more significantly, talent retention issues. The A&D industry has high requirements and expectations for its employees, including specific educational criteria and security clearances. This could necessitate a focus on retaining talent, especially with the increasing number of retirees. Historically, these companies have succeeded with a workforce that possesses deep experience and a strong connection to the company culture. Therefore, given the competitive state of the job market, it is important for the industry to retain highly qualified workers. A&D companies are using compensation and flexible work arrangements to enhance retention and turn the tide of employee attrition. This approach has been adopted by the manufacturing segment of the A&D industry where, according to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 manufacturing industry outlook, there was a rise of 4% in the average hourly earnings of employees between the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the manufacturing industry has undergone a significant shift toward remote work over the last two years, during which there has been a 19% reduction in the average number of quits.10 The retention levels of A&D companies could plateau at a certain point if they continue to only offer flexibility benefits. According to the NAM\u2019s 2023 second quarter manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey, inflexible production, shift needs, and the creation of differences between workforce populations are some major challenges manufacturers face when offering such flexibility to workers.11 The industry will likely explore new avenues to both attract and retain talent. Pursuing and implementing emerging technology can help not only address profit margins, but also invigorate a workforce. Regardless of an employee\u2019s job description, A&D companies may begin to consider initiating new programs that allow employees to engage with advanced technologies, which may include tech-based rotational programs or designated time to pursue passion projects within the company. Developing talent With an increasing number of retirements and an aging workforce (about 26% of the A&D workforce is over the age of 55),12 the industry should train younger professionals for long-term sustainable operations and security. A&D companies can upskill their workforce by developing more learning avenues in alignment with the technological evolution within the industry. These avenues may include: Working closely with colleges to create novel training and workforce development programs; Expanding internships, apprenticeships, and other career development initiatives; and Furthering cooperative research agreements with tier one research universities. Employees in the A&D sector, across all career levels, should be educated on the importance of cybersecurity and should possess a clear understanding of their specific responsibilities in upholding a secure environment.13 And in line with that, A&D companies\u2019 workforce development strategies will not only attract and retain talent but can also help ensure a secure environment for them.","filter_flag":1}

Samsung has successfully implemented a closed-loop system for aluminium recycling, which allows them to reuse the material to create new products, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The company also encourages the recycling of all the other materials that it uses to produce its flagship devices, like glass and plastic. Samsung is keen on incorporating more and more recycled materials in the design of its new products. Samsung's commitment to aluminium recycling is part of a broader effort to reduce the environmental impact of its products. By incorporating recycled materials into their devices, Samsung is not only reducing their carbon footprint but also promoting a circular economy. The company's initiative with Emirates Nature-WWF is a testament to its unwavering dedication to sustainability and environmental protection. Through this partnership, Samsung is driving sustainable change in the UAE and contributing to preserving the region's unique landscapes. For experts in the field, it is clear that Samsung's end-of-life products recycling drive is a significant step towards creating a more sustainable future.

Repurposing materials and equipment when it reaches the end of its usefulness in its current context, the circular economy model, has also been available to telecoms companies for a number of years. Second-life kit provider TXO for example, has been in business for 17 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been promoting the circular economy since we started, but it\u2019s been in the last 5 years that it\u2019s attracted much more attention from the IT and telecoms industry\u201d Kieran Crawford, director of sales at TXO says. \u201cThe IT and telecoms industry is a significant contributor towards C02 equivalent (C02e) emissions, and everyone is now working on reducing their impact.\u201d But why is circular economy becoming so important to how European telcos do business? What is driving the circular economy? One of the major factors encouraging action on climate and driving the circular economy are the ESG goals that have been deployed by mobile network operators. Swedish operator Telia, for example, have concentrated on climate and circularity as one of their three sustainability pillars. With targets of carbon neutrality by 2040 and halving their C02e emissions by 2030, head of group sustainability Sara Nordbrand believes that \u201capplying circular principles is key to achieving the industry\u2019s climate goals and minimising other environmental impacts.\u201d This is true for both the devices that MNO customers are using to access their networks, and the network itself. Various studies by industry groups such as the GSMA and JAC (Joint assembly on CSR) have illuminated why reducing waste and reusing materials where possible is essential to the long-term viability of the telecoms industry. \u201cCurrently, the global economy is using natural resources at a rate faster than can be regenerated. In the telco industry alone, natural sources for six of the elements found in mobile phones are predicted to run out in the next 100 years,\u201d Mark Redmond, chief people officer at Three UK tells Capacity. While ESG targets have had a significant impact on encouraging the telecoms industry to focus more on circular economy, they are not the only factor. As consumers become more sustainability-aware in their purchasing decisions, choosing a mobile provider that can offer a refurbished handset, or at least repair and replace it while they are a customer, is becoming more of an influencing factor. This has led Three UK to introduce its Three Recycle and Reconnected programs, which are aimed to reduce the social and environmental impact of the products it sells, and to support the retrieval of the precious components within them. \u201cThe circular economy represents an untapped opportunity to develop new innovative business models whilst also making a positive social and\/or environmental impact,\u201d Redmond says. Supply chain disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and silicon chip shortages have driven circular economy as well. \u201cWe were seeing customers with up to 200-day lead times for certain equipment\u201d Crawford says. \u201cThe problem with this is two-fold. Firstly, for a new network, you have to wait to turn on the network until this part has been sourced, which delays your time to revenue and monetisation of the network.\u201d \u201cSecondly, knowing you have parts in your network that will take 200 days to replace if they fail is a massive risk that no telco wants to take.\u201d These factors are driving people towards the secondary market, where this equipment doesn\u2019t need to be made new, and can therefore be sourced in a more reasonable timeframe. The Circular Economy has its strengths from a financial standpoint as well. BT Group\u2019s head of circular economy, Matt Manning, provides an example. \u201cAs part of our transition from the public switched telephone network to digital networks we are evaluating the legacy technology housed in our exchanges,\u201d Manning explains. By partnering with technology lifecycle management company N2S, BT can identify cards and switches that are no longer required on the new network. Rather than simply disposing of the unnecessary equipment, partnering with the like of TXO or other secondary market vendors to resell the equipment can unlock a new revenue stream for BT. It can also use the opportunity to reduce costs, by immediately decreasing the power consumption through removing unnecessary equipment, but also by repurposing it elsewhere in its network, avoiding the need to buy new. \u201cIf there isn't an opportunity to reuse, then it gets sent to recycling where any value recovered from the material is shared back with us,\u201d Manning says. Better data is key While the various reasons to buy into the circular economy seem clear and defined, putting it into practice is not as easy. Like Telia, BT Group have targets in place for 2030 and 2040, seeking to create a \u201ccircular BT\u201d and a \u201ccircular technology ecosystem\u201d by each date respectively. Manning believes one of the most significant barriers in BT\u2019s way to achieving these goals are securing granular data from suppliers. \u201cPretty much every decision you make in sustainability should be ultimately linked to good quality data,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting better visibility through environmental declaration reports or product carbon foot printing data can allow us to track its impact over the course of its life, which can help us identify any hotspots.\u201d For example, if BT find a product where 80% of its carbon impact occurs during its use phase, it can look at how it is operating to see if they can make it more efficient. Or if 80% of the impact is in the manufacturing phase they can investigate if this is caused by a certain material, where the product is made, or how it is shipped, and take action accordingly. Unfortunately, a lot of this data is not currently available. \u201cSome suppliers will have access to this data, but they are incentivised to withhold it, as they make more money from selling new products,\u201d Crawford explains. However, that appears to be changing. \u201cThere are some studies for certain products\/areas but [Telia] constantly look for better and updated calculations,\u201d Nordbrand agrees. \u201cWe contribute to collaborative initiatives aiming for standardisation of calculations and we ask all our suppliers to set science-based climate targets. To achieve such goals, most companies need to start working with circularity.\u201d While some suppliers may be nefariously withholding data, this is an unviable long-term strategy, as pressure is building for access to information through groups such as the GSMA and JAC. In addition to lobbying for the provision of this data, industry groups can help to provide more standardised reporting templates, which make data more useful for operators, and easier to supply for vendors. \u201cFrom a competitive tender point of view, we\u2019re much more likely to choose a vendor that can provide you all the data you've ever needed in the world from a sustainability point of view, over one that can't provide data or seems to be unwilling,\u201d Manning says. With this in mind, Three UK have launched a project to gain transparency and better identify risks and improvement opportunities across its supply chain. Partnering with Ecovadis to use their supplier assessment tool, \u201cwe define a number of sustainability-related criteria (including adherence to relevant standards) in our RFPs which inform our decisions,\u201d Redmond explains. This project runs alongside Three\u2019s updated supplier code of conduct, which include new provisions on circular economy, climate impact, environmental impact of goods and services, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity. Telia also rely on their supplier code of conduct to ensure they receive the right information from companies they work with. \u201cIn practice this means that we try to \u2018prevent, reduce, reuse and recycle\u2019 waste, in that order. This logic is increasingly applied in different parts of our operations,\u201d Nordbrand says. In addition to capturing data on a product\u2019s lifecycle while it is being manufactured, understanding how it will be used is equally important, and this extends to the devices that are being used by Telia and other operators\u2019 customers. \u201cCertain new products replace physical products \u2013 the mobile phone is a great example replacing both cameras, cd-players and answering machines. Today it can be about an app replacing a TV set top box or cloud services replacing more physical products at customers\u2019 own premises,\u201d Nordbrand expands. Capturing this information Furthermore, regulation is playing its part. \u201cEuropean regulations will affect BT and mean that we have to report material inflows and outflows across our business, as well as whether those materials are virgin, or recycled,\u201d Manning says. \u201cFor us to be able to report on this properly, the data availability on supply chains needs to be scaled up.\u201d While the principle of circular economy has been around for a long time, there is clearly a revitalised interest in adopting it. Time is of the essence, and if the most impactful areas of telecoms business operations are to be addressed, data to help identify what they are, and what needs to be changed is essential.","filter_flag":1}

Tobin A familiar aroma wafted through the Believer Meats test kitchen earlier this year as Research and Development Chef Andres Voloschin flipped sizzling strips of chicken conjured from cells. Scientists, not farmers, produced this chicken. More than 150 startups are chasing an ambitious goal: meat that doesn't require raising and killing animals that is affordable and tastes and feels like the meat we eat now. They are part of a young industry aiming to use cell biology to reduce the environmental impact of the world's ever-increasing demand for meat and change global protein production the way electric cars are shaking up the auto industry. \"We are addicted to meat as a species. It's part of our evolution. It's part of our culture,\" said Believer founder Yaakov Nahmias, whose country, Israel, is an industry hub along with California and Singapore. But \"we thought about quantity rather than the environment, rather than sustainability.\" Companies making so-called \"cultivated,\" or \"cultured\" meat, which is also popularly known as \"lab-grown\" meat, are trying to scale up quickly\u2014partnering with traditional meat companies, drawing more and more investors and breaking ground on new production facilities in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Credit: AP Photo\/Emma H. Tobin Wide adoption of meat from cells is nowhere near assured, however. This meat is expensive to make. There are scientific challenges, such as learning how to mimic the complex structure of steak. Government regulation is another obstacle. Only Singapore and the U.S. allow sales of cultivated meat. And while many people who have tried it say they like it, others find the idea distasteful. An Associated Press-NORC poll found that half of adults in the meat-hungry U.S. would be unlikely to try it. A majority of those who said they wouldn't said \"it just sounds weird.\" Even Nahmias' 10-year-old son Oren says he will only eat traditional meat. \"I feel bad\" for the animals, he said, \"but they are yummy!\" HOW CELLS CAN BE TURNED INTO A CUTLET The science behind this new meat comes from the medical world. The process starts with cells. Depending on the company, the cells may come from a piece of tissue, a fertilized egg or a cell \"bank.\" Various sorts can be used; scientists choose cells that can self-renew and turn into the muscle and fat cells that make up meat tissue. From starter cells they create \"cell lines\" so they don't have to keep going back to animals.

Credit: AP Photo\/Laura Ungar These cells are placed inside vessels of various sizes called bioreactors and bathed in a nutrient-rich broth where they multiply. Thick, structured meat also requires a scaffold that helps cells organize into a shape. Changes in the composition of the broth, or media, and cues from the scaffolding, tell immature cells to turn into muscle, fat and connective tissue. Producing meat this way could dramatically reduce the impact of meat on the environment because it would reduce the need for land for the animals and for feed. \"The most important thing is that this field move forward and start reducing the destruction to our environment associated with current animal agriculture techniques,\" said Glenn Gaudette, a biomedical engineering specialist at Boston College. But transforming the ecosystem is a distant vision. Scientists and industry experts say cultivated meats have a way to go before they're indistinguishable from conventional meats, especially when it comes to the texture of products other than burgers or nuggets.

Gaudette said scientists are still trying to find the best scaffolds for structured meat, which must include a way for oxygen to get to all the cells. Options include animal-based scaffolds such as gelatin and, increasingly, decellularized vegetables like spinach. Experts expect scientists to overcome the remaining scientific hurdles. But they say shaping human perception may be more difficult. MEAT GROWN IN A LAB JUST SOUNDS STRANGE Most people connect meat production with farms rather than science labs\u2014which influences how they view these new products. In the AP-NORC poll, just 18% of U.S. adults said they are extremely or very likely to try cultivated meat, and 30% said they are somewhat likely. Those under 45 years old are more likely than older adults to try it and men are more likely than women. When those unlikely to try it were asked to choose from a list of reasons why, half said they didn't think it would be safe.

Credit: AP Photo\/Emma H. Tobin That's a concern for respondent Nora Bailey, 31, a mother of three in rural Arkansas. \"I would obviously want to do more research as far as the long-term effects,\" since early products deemed safe may later be found to be unsafe, she said. A World Health Organization report noted several potential safety issues, such as microbial contamination at various points in the process, biological by-products and scaffolding that some people might be allergic to. Experts acknowledged a lot more safety testing is needed but noted that conventional meat carries significant food-safety risks, such as potential bacterial contamination during slaughter. At this point, relatively few people have tried cultivated meat. But since its approval in the U.S. this summer, a small number of diners are eating it for the first time at particular restaurants and special events. People who recently tried cultivated chicken at U.S. company Good Meat's headquarters in Alameda, California, said they liked it and would eat it again.

The report, based on the latest data from the EMCDDA and its co-author Europol, lays bare the scope of the \u20ac11.4bn illicit cannabis market, which is thought to have served 22.6m Europeans over the past year. Although the size of the market \u2018remains stable\u2019, the report raises a number of key concerns, including the sharp rise in THC potency, the rapid emergence of semi-synthetic cannabinoids such as HHC, and the surprising environmental implications of Europe\u2019s illicit cannabis cultivation industry. \u201cAll of these developments are taking place while there is an ongoing policy debate in Europe, and globally, which is impacting licit and illicit markets leading to challenges for law enforcement and criminal justice systems,\u201d the EMCDDA\u2019s head of markets, crime and supply, Andrew Cunningham, said in the report\u2019s launch webinar. Spain, Morocco and the Western Balkans With an estimated 22.6m users in the last year, cannabis is the most commonly consumed illicit substance in Europe by some margin, eclipsing cocaine, the next most commonly used illicit substance, six-fold. Herbal cannabis, or cannabis flower, represents over three quarters (77%) of the total market value (at least \u20ac8.8bn), while cannabis resin accounts for the other 23%, estimated to be around 362 tonnes. The quantity of herbal cannabis seized in the EU, Norway and Turkey hit all-time records in 2021, topping 288 tonnes. According to the available data, the vast majority of cannabis seized in the EU comes from a small number of countries. One of these is Spain, which in 2021 represented around 51% of the total herbal cannabis seized in the EU, around 130 tonnes, while Italy (47 tonnes) and France (nearly 40 tonnes) together represented another third of the total. These figures were overshadowed by the record 850 tonnes of cannabis resin seized in 2021 in the EU, Norway and Turkey, with Spain once again representing the majority of seizures, some 82%. \u201cMost of the cannabis resin available on the European market comes from Morocco, and due to its geographical location, Spain is the main entry point in the EU,\u201d EMCDDA scientific analyst Robert Patrancus said. Although Morocco remains the main source of resin into Europe, numerous EU countries have reported it as a source for herbal cannabis in recent years, marking a diversification of the product. When it comes to herbal cannabis, however, while the report suggests the vast majority is grown within the EU, the Western Balkan region continues to be an important location in the supply of herbal cannabis to the EU. This is beginning to change, though, with efforts in Albania to tackle the issue reportedly leading to a decrease in seizures since 2018. \u201cAs part of these changes, to be closer to the main consumer market, some of the Western Balkan criminal networks have adapted a new business model, seeing them get involved in cannabis cultivation and trafficking inside the EU.\u201d Notably, after North Macedonia legalised cannabis production for medical use in 2016, \u2018large quantities\u2019 of legally grown product are being diverted to the illicit market, a trend also seen in Albania. While the Americas, West Africa and Southeast Asia are no longer considered major sources of illicit cannabis imports, there has been an \u2018increase in the frequency of herbal cannabis traffic from Canada and the US recently\u2019. Semi-synthetic cannabinoids Another key issue raised in the report is the increasing range of different consumer cannabis products stretching far beyond the \u2018old hash plus weed model\u2019, with vapes, edibles, oils and extracts now readily available to consumers across Europe. This is true not only in product diversity, but also in potency, with data suggesting that the THC content in cannabis has increased by 57% in herbal cannabis over the last decade, and nearly 200% in resin, likely due to improvements in genetics and extraction techniques. Cannabis has also become more affordable, with data taking into account the costs \u2018corrected for purity or potency in the context of the living standards of a given country\u2019 suggesting \u2018your money goes 25% further than it used to\u2019. A concerning and rapidly evolving part of this market diversification is the rise of semi-synthetic cannabinoids, which the EMCDDA suggests are \u2018mostly made from CBD\u2019. Substances such as HHC, Delta 8 and Delta 10 THC occur naturally in the cannabis plant in small quantities, the EMCDDA explained, but producers are now commonly converting non-psychoactive CBD into these psychoactive substances in labs. \u201cCBD has now become a precursor,\u201d Laurent Laniel, the EMCDDA\u2019s principal scientific analyst, told the webinar. \u201cWhy have people suddenly decided to manufacture these new semi-synthetic extracts from CBD? Because there was an overproduction of CBD in the US and Canada. People invested money in producing CBD cannabis and then couldn\u2019t sell it on the market, so they converted it into these new products so as not to lose all their investment, or even make a profit.\u201d The danger, he added, is that these substances are new and we do not yet have the data to establish if they are safe to consume. The environmental impact of illicit cannabis production While the EMCDDA stipulated that its data around cannabis production sites in the EU is \u2018incomplete\u2019, it suggested that some 7,000 illicit cultivation sites were dismantled in 2019 across 14 member states. In 2020 and 2021, these figures rose to 10,000 and 9,000 respectively. The number of cannabis plants seized, a \u2018key indicator\u2019 used to determine the scale of the illicit market, hit 4.3m in 2021, with around 3.2m of these coming from Spain, representing a nearly twofold increase on 2020. Notably, in Turkey, the number of cannabis plants seized in 2021 was 18 times higher than in the entire EU put together, topping 76m. The scale of this market is thought to be having a significant environmental impact, given the high water and energy demands of cultivating large amounts of cannabis, while the available data is also improving due to the increasing number of regulated markets across the EU. Indoor cultivation of 1 kg of herbal cannabis requires around 6,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, which equates to around 1,400 kg of carbon footprint. To put this into perspective, a Dutch electricity network provider suggested that the electricity stolen for cannabis production in 2021 was around 1bn kilowatt hours. This is the equivalent of the annual household electricity for a city the size of Rotterdam. A second major environmental impact is water usage. If grown outdoors, one cannabis plant requires around 19\u201321 litres of water every day, and the average growing cycle is roughly 150 days. The EMCDDA offered a real-world example of a dismantled cultivation operation in Spain that contained 400,000 plants. Taking these figures into account, one harvest cycle would require around 1.8bn litres of water, the equivalent of the daily water consumption of a country the size of Latvia. Despite this, the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis cultivation is estimated to be around 60 to 100 times larger than outdoor cultivation. To illustrate this, to match the carbon footprint of a single joint\u2019s worth of cannabis (0.3 g) grown outdoors, you\u2019d have to drive just 70 metres in a hybrid electric vehicle. For indoor-grown cannabis, this jumps to 4.6 km.","filter_flag":1}

The drinks industry\u2019s attempts to reduce its environmental impact range from how it sources its ingredients, to more efficient production, through to the packaging and transport of the finished products. An area that has been of increasing interest to drinks companies is that of sustainable or regenerative agriculture. Producers are looking not only to improve the way their ingredients are grown but to go beyond that and adopt new practices that can actually improve the environment by putting nutrients back into the soil and improving its general health and stability. Packaging is another area of focus as companies look to reduce the amount of virgin plastic used for bottles and containers, either by using more recycled materials or looking to biodegradable alternatives like paper and card. With the first paper liquid bottles now in production it will be interesting to see whether such concepts take off at scale. The development of new preservatives and ingredients can also be linked to environmental impact, with biochemical companies developing new products that are less harmful to produce, or are free of animal products or other ingredients that consumers may wish to avoid. Product development continues apace, with one of the most active areas being that of ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails. RTDs were given a boost during the pandemic with customers looking for at-home alternatives to drinks available in bars. Even though on-premise drinking has bounced back since, the RTD sector has not slowed, with new products still being released and even companies from outside the spirits sector looking to take advantage by releasing their own ranges. While the convenience of RTDs is a clear selling point, when consumers do seek out traditional cocktails or spirits there is an increasing shift towards artisanal products sold on the promise of quality. Small-batch spirits, celebrity-endorsed products, or those that can point to organic or environmental production are all gaining traction. Alternatives to alcoholic drinks have also experienced growth. While the variety of non-alcoholic beers and ciders continues to develop, it is in other areas such as non-alcoholic wine where there is the most interest, due to the underdeveloped nature of the segment. Spirit and cocktail alternatives are also being seen, particularly as consumers become more conscious of the health impact that a high volume of alcohol consumption can have. The final area of product growth is in health or enhanced drinks, whether they be probiotics, cultured milk, or protein beverages. With the health and lifestyle sector growing, products that are seen to contribute to a balanced diet or provide other benefits are increasingly in demand. We hope our Excellence Awards Report not only provides recognition to those companies at the cutting edge of the industry but also provides a useful snapshot of the industry\u2019s current state.

And Burger King, a leader in incorporating plant-based meat into its fast-food business globally, is taking note. Over in the United Kingdom, Burger King aims to serve a menu that is 50 percent plant-based by 2030, in part to meet its sustainability goals and also as a mirror of consumer demand. Burger King This fall, Burger King UK launched a campaign in partnership with The Vegetarian Butcher\u2014its plant-based meat supplier\u2014to challenge the public\u2019s perceptions about plant-based foods. According to a study conducted by the fast-food chain, 29 percent of Brits are interested in a more flexitarian lifestyle, particularly on Mondays, which are viewed as the best day to start new habits. However, 48 percent believe they would miss out on taste if they chose plant-based options. To address these concerns, Burger King UK and The Vegetarian Butcher recruited Gogglebox star Joe Baggs to host a taste test game called \u201cIs this plant-based?\u201d The aim was to gauge whether participants could differentiate between meat and plant-based products. The majority of participants were surprised to find that the food items in question were actually Burger King\u2019s Vegan Royale and Plant-Based Whopper, both of which they found to be \u201cjust like meat.\u201d Burger King The Burger King UK study also uncovered that while 63 percent of Brits are confident they can easily tell the difference between meat and plant-based foods, 76 percent attribute this to differences in texture and taste. The \u201cIs this plant-based?\u201d campaign appears to have challenged these preconceptions, as many participants were willing to order the plant-based options again, stating they \u201ctaste so good\u201d and \u201clook very meaty.\u201d Following this campaign, Burger King UK introduced a \u2018Meat Free Monday\u2019 promotion through its app, allowing consumers to get a Plant-Based Whopper or Vegan Royale for just \u00a32.99 on Mondays to encourage meat-eaters, flexitarians, and vegans alike to explore its plant-based options. Burger King blurs the line between meat and plants Burger King\u2019s campaign in the UK is not the first time the fast-food chain has challenged consumers to take a closer look at plant-based meat as an indistinguishable alternative to animal meat. Burger King Last year, in a similar campaign, Burger King Austria flipped the script by asking customers if they wanted \u201cregular or meat-based\u201d Whoppers. \u201cWith this question, we want to stimulate the social debate and show that our plant-based alternatives have a confusing taste,\u201d Jan-Christoph K\u00fcster, Chief Marketing Officer of the TQSR Group, the Austrian master franchisee of the Burger King brand, said in a German language statement. \u201cMeat is one option, but it is not the only one,\u201d K\u00fcster said. \u201cWe leave it open to our guests what is normal for them; everyone should have the same taste.\u201d Together, these initiatives aimed to make plant-based options the default choice, challenging conventional norms around meat consumption. For its part, Burger King has been leading the plant-based fast-food charge since it introduced the Impossible Whopper Stateside in 2019. Burger King UK Since then, the global chain has experimented with meat-free (and sometimes fully vegan) pop-ups all over the world, including wildly successful events in both the UK and Germany that resulted in new menu items such as vegan bacon cheeseburgers, plant-based chicken options, and more. Meat consumption falls in Europe Burger King is onto something because both the United Kingdom and Germany have clocked in a decline in meat consumption this year. New government data indicates that meat consumption in the UK is at its lowest level since records began in the 1970s. On average, people ate 854 grams of meat per week at home in the year to March 2022, marking a 14 percent decrease since 2012. The decline in meat consumption also includes a 26 percent drop in beef, pork, and lamb, and an 11 percent drop in chicken and other meat products over the past decade. According to the data, takeaway meat consumption also fell, with people eating less than half of what they consumed in 2012. Several factors are attributed to this decline, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of living crisis precipitated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and broader lifestyle changes. In Germany, a yearly survey commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture found that only 20 percent of Germans now eat meat daily, compared to 34 percent in 2015. Unsplash Here, the consumption of plant-based alternatives has increased from 5 percent in 2020 to 10 percent today. This trend is particularly noticeable among younger people, with 18 percent of those aged 14 to 29 and 10 percent of those aged 30 to 44 consuming alternative meat products daily. More than half of the survey respondents, 53 percent, have purchased plant-based products at least once. Additionally, 46 percent of those surveyed said they consciously limit their meat consumption, adopting a flexitarian approach to their diet. These findings were presented last month at the New Food Conference, an event organized by food awareness organization ProVeg International. \u201cGermany really has fallen out of love with meat,\u201d Lea Stockmeier, Senior International Event Manager at ProVeg and the conference organizer, said in a statement. \u201cMany people are intentionally eating less meat, and for a number of good reasons\u2014curiosity, climate concerns, for the taste, and out of concern for animal welfare,\u201d Stockmeier said. These findings, combined with the drop in the UK\u2019s meat consumption, validate Burger King\u2019s approach in these regions, where plant-based meat is moving in on animal meat as the new norm.","filter_flag":1}

The trends we see in fashion are a reflection of societal changes and historical events that shape our world. Fashion has always been influenced by technology, changes in consumer behavior, and political and social movements. In recent years, we have seen a growing trend towards inclusivity and diversity in the fashion industry. Brands are embracing models of different ages, sizes, and ethnicities to showcase their products. This reflects a changing society that values and celebrates differences. We have also witnessed a rise in sustainable fashion and body positivity movements, indicating a growing concern for the environment and a desire for greater inclusivity and acceptance of different body types. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the fashion industry, accelerating the shift towards comfortable and functional clothing. Face masks have become a new fashion accessory, with designers incorporating them into their collections. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of e-commerce, with online sales becoming increasingly dominant in the industry. Moreover, the pandemic has forced the industry to re-evaluate its environmental impact, leading brands to explore new ways of creating sustainable and eco-friendly collections. Fashion is also a way of expressing political and social messages. In recent years, slogans and symbols have become increasingly prevalent in fashion. For instance, the pink pussy hat emerged as a symbol of resistance during the Women's March in 2017, and black clothing was worn in solidarity with the #MeToo movement. In this manner, fashion can mirror the political and social climate of the era, serving as a platform for protest and activism. Fashion is a mirror of society, reflecting the cultural and social changes of the modern world. The industry is constantly evolving, influenced by technology, changes in consumer behavior, and political and social movements. Fashion provides a way for individuals to express their identity and differentiate themselves from others, and it can also serve as a platform for political and social messages. As the world continues to change, fashion will continue to evolve and adapt, reflecting the values and concerns of our society. Here are some examples that can help illustrate how fashion reflects the cultural and social changes of the modern world and provides concrete examples of the industry's response to these changes. The rise of sustainable and eco-friendly fashion The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, with the production and disposal of clothing contributing to significant environmental damage. In recent years, many brands have taken steps towards sustainability, such as using recycled materials, reducing waste in production, and investing in ethical and eco-friendly practices. Stella McCartney is a pioneer in sustainable fashion, using materials like organic cotton and recycled polyester in her collections and has also launched initiatives like the circular economy program to promote sustainable practices within the industry. The impact of social media on fashion Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become important tools for fashion influencers and designers to reach a wider audience and showcase their products. Moreover, social media has created a shift towards fast fashion, with consumers demanding new and trendy styles at a faster pace. This has created both opportunities and challenges for the industry as it strives to keep up with changing consumer preferences and maintain a sustainable approach to production. The influence of streetwear on high fashion Streetwear, which originated from urban and skateboarding cultures, has become a major influence on high fashion. Luxury brands such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga have incorporated streetwear elements like oversized silhouettes and graphic prints into their collections. Furthermore, collaborations between streetwear brands and high-fashion labels have become increasingly common. The fashion industry's response to the Black Lives Matter movement In 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement brought issues of racial inequality and diversity to the forefront of many industries, including fashion. Many brands released statements and pledged to improve diversity and inclusion within their companies, while also creating collections that celebrate Black culture and promoting Black-owned businesses. The movement has also led to greater scrutiny of the industry's treatment of Black models and the lack of representation in the fashion world. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fashion The pandemic has indeed led to significant changes in the fashion industry. As people spend more time at home, there has been a rise in the demand for loungewear and comfortable clothing. It has also accelerated the shift towards e-commerce, with online sales becoming increasingly dominant in the industry. Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted the industry's environmental impact, leading to a greater focus on sustainability and ethical practices. The history of fashion as a reflection of society Fashion has always been influenced by social and cultural movements and has been used to express political and social messages throughout history. For example, the hippie movement in the 1960s was characterized by loose, flowing clothing and natural fabrics, reflecting a rejection of mainstream culture and a desire for peace and freedom. Similarly, the punk movement in the 1970s was characterized by leather jackets, torn clothing, and safety pins, reflecting a rejection of the establishment and a desire for rebellion. Looking back at the history of fashion can help us understand how it has been shaped by societal changes and movements. Fashion has long been regarded as a powerful cultural force, shaping not only our personal styles but also reflecting the broader social, economic, and cultural landscape. One insightful perspective on fashion comes from the renowned French philosopher and sociologist, Jean Baudrillard. He regarded fashion as a reflection of consumer society and capitalism, driven by the constant production and consumption of new styles. Baudrillard's concept of the hyperreal is particularly relevant when understanding the modern fashion industry. In an era dominated by social media, fashion has taken on a new dimension, transcending physical clothing and becoming a digital spectacle. With influencers, celebrities, and brands showcasing an idealized and often unattainable lifestyle, fashion has become a hyperreal simulation, blurring the lines between reality and illusion. Through meticulously curated images and carefully constructed personas, fashion not only reflects society but also shapes it by perpetuating the desire for constant novelty and unattainable perfection. Today's fashion industry thrives on the rapid turnover of trends, which creates an incessant cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. With fast fashion brands and online retailers constantly churning out new collections at affordable prices, consumers are enticed to keep up with the latest trends, fueling the need for constant consumption. Fashion has become an integral part of consumer culture, driving economic growth while simultaneously perpetuating a sense of never-ending longing. Social media platforms have become the epicenter of fashion influence and consumption, shaping our perception of what is desirable and fashionable. Influencers, with their carefully crafted online personas, play a significant role in this process. They have become the new arbiters of taste and style, transforming fashion into an aspirational commodity. Through their promotion of a constant stream of new products and trends, influencers contribute to the cycle of desire, enticing their followers to seek validation through the acquisition of the latest fashion items. Consequently, fashion has become increasingly synonymous with social media visibility and validation. While the rapid turnover of fashion trends offers a sense of novelty and excitement, it also has detrimental consequences for both the environment and the individuals involved. The fast fashion industry's reliance on cheap labor and the overproduction of garments contributes to environmental degradation and waste. Additionally, the pressure to constantly stay up-to-date with the latest trends can lead to a culture of overconsumption, where individuals accumulate more clothing than they actually need, often resulting in sense of dissatisfaction and generating waste. Fashion remains a powerful mirror of society, reflecting the cultural and social changes of the modern world. It serves as a platform for self-expression, a channel for political and social messages, and a symbol of our desire for novelty and perfection. However, as we continue to navigate the complexities of the fashion industry, it is crucial to consider the environmental and social impact of our choices. By embracing sustainability, inclusivity, and conscious consumption, we can shape fashion into a force that not only reflects our values but also contributes to a more equitable and sustainable society. It is up to us to redefine the narrative and ensure that fashion remains an art form that empowers and inspires, rather than perpetuates dissatisfaction and waste.","filter_flag":1}

With such innovation also comes scrutiny and new regulations to navigate. Kirk Donohoe, chief product officer at Mangopay, says he anticipates a heightened level of regulatory oversight for fintech in 2024, noting how such companies will need to take heed of changes concerning data privacy, cybersecurity and financial services \u2014 due to AI security threats and new DeFi (decentralised finance) regulations. But that isn\u2019t Donohoe\u2019s only fintech prediction for 2024. We asked him \u2014 and Maryam Velasque, partner, financial services and private equity at X-PM \u2014 for the hottest trends they see making waves in 2024. Advertisement 1\/ A wider range of AI applications Donohoe says over half of fintech companies are now using AI to deliver new products and services as key differentiators. \u201cWith models making it easier and cheaper to integrate AI capabilities within digital products, we will see more banks and fintech companies double down on AI initiatives in hopes to release products that will bring incremental revenue.\u201d Donohoe believes there will be a wider range of AI applications in 2024, including creditworthiness assessment, robo-advisory services, algorithmic trading and risk evaluation and management. This trend, he says, will not only set digital products apart but also enhance the overall fintech experiences for end-users, making it an important feature influencing customer-buying decisions. 2\/ More sustainable payments Fintech and banks are responding to the need for more sustainable financial solutions \u2014 in part, perhaps, due to the European Commission\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive now requiring banks and insurance companies to disclose more information about how they operate and deal with environmental change. One way that fintech and banks are making finance more sustainable is by reducing their own environmental impact. Some banks, for example, are committing to becoming carbon neutral and reducing their waste. Another method is by promoting digital payment solutions, a trend that\u2019s expected to evolve in 2024. \u201cDigital payments are more eco-friendly than traditional payment methods, such as cash and credit cards,\u201d says Donohoe. \u201cFor example, digital payments do not require the production of physical cards or the use of paper receipts.\u201d Velasque agrees, noting that she expects to see an uptick in digital payment platforms. \u201cWith the global shift towards cashless transactions, platforms that facilitate smooth, quick and secure digital payments are in high demand,\u201d she says. \u201cThese services, including peer-to-peer transfer apps, mobile wallets and services for merchants to accept online payments, are going to grow.\u201d 3\/ Increased adoption of stablecoins A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency. Its value is linked to a \u201cstable\u201d currency or a commodity, like gold, to help stabilise its price. Companies like CheapAir, ExpressVPN, Twitch and Travala.com accept stablecoins as a method of payment \u2014 and Donohoe thinks adoption will continue. \u201cStablecoins have traditionally served as trading capital and settlement tools for traders,\u201d says Donohoe. \u201cHowever, in recent years, we've witnessed an increasing acceptance of stablecoins in the business sector through innovative fintech companies offering simpler and faster ways to convert into fiat currencies. \u201cThis is leading to faster adoption, with companies like Western Union and MoneyGram now offering stablecoins for cross-border transfers.\u201d Advertisement 4\/ A shift of revenue models to SaaS Donohoe believes that with interchange erosion reducing the amount in fees fintech companies are able to earn, the shift towards new revenue models like SaaS from traditional software distribution will gain momentum in the fintech sector next year. \u201cThe SaaS model helps fintech achieve returns for the considerable investment they\u2019ve put into new products and experiences, as well as provide predictability of revenue while improving accessibility for customers,\u201d he says. \u201cAdditionally, the scalability of SaaS solutions allows businesses to flexibly accommodate their growth.\u201d 5\/ Mergers and acquisitions Velasque expects to see more consolidation and M&A activities in 2024 \u2014 and fewer early-stage startups. \u201cEstablished fintech firms and traditional financial institutions will look to merge or acquire others to expand market reach and service offerings,\u201d she says. \u201cThis consolidation phase, while reducing the number of new startups, signifies a move towards a more stable fintech ecosystem.\u201d Donohoe agrees, noting how the global investment focus shifting towards solving climate change and other emerging technologies actually bottoms out fintech startup valuations, hindering their ability to grow. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen almost double the number of M&As in the beginning of 2023 and we expect more in 2024, as the cost to acquire becomes cheaper than the cost to build.\u201d 6\/ More regulation as the Brexit grace period ends There is expected to be an increased focus on regulatory compliance as a whole in 2024 as the grace period for FCA EU licences requirements comes to an end. Companies operating in the UK under a Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR) will need to be fully authorised by the FCA to continue operating in the UK. \u201cFintechs have been grappling with regulatory hurdles primarily due to compliance issues,\u201d says Velasque. \u201cThe pathway to 2024 might necessitate a stronger adherence to \u2014 or adaptation of \u2014 the new regulatory frameworks to navigate these hurdles successfully.\u201d 7\/ Increased regulation around DeFi Decentralised finance, or DeFi, integrates cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to manage financial transactions without banks, exchanges or brokerages. Donohoe says the UK government is supportive of the development of DeFi, and the FCA has recognised its potential benefits \u2014 such as increased financial inclusion and innovation. However, the scale of its adoption has prompted regulators to look into possible security threats it may pose. \u201cRecently, the FCA has limited remit over crypto, and its current focus is on ensuring that crypto firms that operate in the UK comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism legislation,\u201d says Donohoe. \u201cMeanwhile, many jurisdictions around the world are still in the infancy of developing their approach to regulating crypto assets and crypto asset services.\u201d How to stay ahead Donohoe recommends that fintechs collaborate with regulators when attempting to keep up and ahead of changing rules.

This has spurred a new generation of companies that are innovating chemical recycling techniques to tackle waste from major fibres such as cellulosics like cotton, and synthetics like polyester and nylon. For years, some of the largest clothing brands in the world have maintained the exclusivity of their products through a costly process\u2014not in terms of financial expense, but environmental toll\u2014incinerating unsold stock. Yet, the tide is turning, partly due to stricter EU waste legislation and a growing public awareness of recycling and sustainability issues. Such legislation is pushing manufacturers away from burning unsold garments towards an eco-friendlier obligation of recycling\u2014mirroring the recycling responsibilities for packaging materials. A staggering 92 million tonnes1 of textile waste are generated globally every year, and with 80 to 100 billion new items of clothing produced annually, a vast majority\u201487 per cent\u2014of the fibres and materials used in manufacturing clothes are destined for incinerators or landfills. It is reported that only a mere 20 per cent of textile waste is actually collected for recycling, and an even smaller fraction, just one per cent, is repurposed into new clothing. One of the central hurdles in recycling post-consumer textile waste and fostering a circular economy is the poor quality of the recycled materials. Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) content is often identified by sustainability professionals as a critical area for improvement, essential for reducing the volume of waste. As such, enhancing the technologies for recycling and processing fibres is a crucial step in elevating the quality of these post-consumer goods. The distinction between pre-consumer and post-consumer waste is significant. Pre-consumer waste, consisting of scraps and trimmings, arises during the manufacturing process. On the other hand, post-consumer waste is made up of clothing that consumers have discarded, whether because it is damaged, out of style, or no longer wanted. As fashion trends and consumer demands continue to evolve rapidly, the issue of textile waste intensifies, threatening the well-being of future generations. Landfills are increasingly burdened with mounds of abandoned garments, a testament to the pressing need for advanced recycling solutions in the textile industry. What are the Technologies That Can be Used for Post-Consumer Recycling for Textiles? Post-consumer textile waste poses a unique challenge as newly produced textiles frequently approach their end of life shortly after entering the market. China and the United States are the largest producers of textile waste, generating 20 million tonnes and 17 million tonnes respectively2. Globally, only about 20 per cent of textiles3 are selected for recycling or reuse. The second-hand clothing market, though sizeable, is oversaturated, leading to a scenario where only a fraction of collected textiles are sold. The remainder, deemed non-rewearable, is either downcycled, incinerated, or relegated to landfills. Despite obstacles such as inefficient waste collection and sorting systems or the low cost of virgin materials, new recycling technologies are making headway. Two primary methods for recycling fibres have been developed: mechanical and chemical recycling. We explore these methods below, including the technological advancements that have propelled them. Mechanical Recycling involves breaking down the material to create a fibrous substance that can be respun. This process, however, tends to shorten and weaken the fibres, compromising their quality. Consequently, mechanically recycled fibres often exhibit limited circularity and typically require blending with virgin fibres to compensate. Innovations in technology now enable companies to produce mechanically recycled natural fibres of comparable quality to virgin materials without the need to mix in new fibres. Resilk4, for example, is a novel fibre crafted entirely from recycled silk. Resilk aims to honour the intrinsic value of silk fabrics and the extensive labour involved in their creation, from the cultivation of mulberries and silkworms to the weaving of yarns and fabrics. Chemical Recycling involves depolymerization, a process that breaks down materials to their raw constituents, facilitating the creation of new filaments which are subsequently transformed into threads. Chemically recycled fibres can endure multiple recycling rounds without quality degradation, matching the quality of virgin fibres. Techniques for the chemical recycling of synthetics have expanded in recent years. Depolymerisation, which reduces plastic polymers to monomer units for the manufacture of new plastic products, is one such process. Additionally, technologies like pyrolysis and gasification have gained traction. Processes such as hydrolysis, alcoholysis, and aminolysis are employed to chemically recycle PET textiles. Synthetic fibres like polyesters, polyamides, and polyolefins, present in cotton-polyester blends, can be chemically separated and transformed into new fibres. Numerous companies have initiated the separation and recovery of mixed fibres like polyester and cotton from old garments, producing virgin-equivalent raw materials fit for ongoing recycling. Technological advancements now allow the chemical recycling of natural fibres beyond experimental lab stages. The transformation of cotton into viscose is a prominent example of this recycling process, utilising a method similar to that used for converting wood pulp into viscose, breaking down pure cotton fabric into a pulp that can be reformed. Technologies That Can be Used for Post-Consumer Recycling for Textiles The recycling of textile materials, much like plastics, presents considerable challenges. The diversity of materials, constructions, and dyes used complicates the recycling process post-production. Moreover, as fashion-related items, they frequently undergo changes in style and design and come equipped with a variety of accessories, further complicating their automatic recycling. Below is an overview of some technologies that facilitate Post-Consumer Recycling for textiles: Cutting, Shredding, and Carding: Mechanical processes such as cutting, shredding, and carding are used to recycle post-consumer textile waste. These methods break down fabric into fibres that can be reused to create new products. The resulting fibres can be spun into yarns suitable for knitting, nonwoven fabrics, and woven textiles. This approach is primarily applied in the recycling of home insulation and carpet padding. Flocking: Flocking involves applying numerous small fibre particles, known as flock, onto a surface. This term can also refer to the materials mainly used for their flocked surface, or to the texture produced by the flocking process. An item might be flocked to increase its value or to impart a particular tactile quality. Mechanical Recycling: Ongoing technological advancements have enabled mills to produce textiles from natural fibres with a quality nearly indistinguishable from virgin materials through mechanical recycling, without the need to add virgin content. Mechanical recycling transforms waste into a secondary raw material without changing its chemical structure. Key mechanical recycling techniques for textiles include shredding fabrics and melting and extruding synthetic fibres like polyester. Fibersort: Fibersort is a technology that automatically sorts large volumes of mixed post-consumer textiles based on their material composition. The aim is to enable these used textiles to be recycled back into raw materials for new clothing production. Fibersort categorises non-rewearable, discarded garments by material and colour. It classifies non-wearable textile items into grades of materials ready for recycling. High-value recycling processes play an integral role in the circular economy, converting low-value waste into new, high-value textiles. Fibersort stands as a pivotal technology in enabling textile resources to cyclically re-enter the supply chain. Ending Note While there are challenges that hinder the recycling process, such as inefficient waste collection and sorting systems, along with a dampened demand for recycled materials owing to the competitive market price of virgin materials, new recycling innovations are nonetheless making headway. Furthermore, financial barriers are being overcome, facilitating the commercial expansion of these technologies. It should be noted, however, that not all textiles can be recycled through enzymatic hydrolysis, but significant yields have been achieved at low temperatures. The incorporation of current technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), to facilitate effective sorting and identification of textile waste, is also gaining prominence. Perhaps the time has come to take meaningful steps towards achieving sustainability in fashion, thereby moving closer to a truly circular economy.","filter_flag":1}

It signposts the company\u2019s increased retail focus, which its CEO Arturo Elizondo and partnerships head Nick Toriello outline in an interview with Green Queen. Last month, The EVERY Co announced a partnership with Grupo Nutresa, the largest FMCG food company in Colombia and one of Latin America\u2019s most influential players in the sector. EVERY which has been operating since 2014, makes animal-free egg proteins from precision fermentation. In 2021, it introduced its EVERY protein (initially launched as ClearEgg), a nature-equivalent egg white protein that has since featured in smoothies, macarons and canned cocktails through various partnerships. But with Nutresa, EVERY is targeting another vertical, and showcasing its ambition via a new partnership that will make use of EVERY EggWhite protein, a functional replacement for egg whites, as a binding agent in meat alternatives under Nutresa\u2019s Zen\u00fa and Pietran brands. This is not EVERY\u2019s first time working with a food giant: the startup has collaborated with ingredients giant Ingredion and drinks conglomerate AB InBev in the past. Courtesy: The EVERY Co\/Pulp Culture EVERY says its proteins are nature-identical and allow manufacturers to avoid disease risks, price fluctuation issues, and the environmental footprint of conventional animal proteins. The EVERY EggWhite is described as a \u201chyperfunctional protein\u201d, which will be leveraged by Nutresa\u2019s formulations to deliver \u201cnext-level binding and gelation qualities\u201d that allow analogues to resemble their traditional counterparts more closely, without the use of \u201coverly processed ingredients\u201d. It\u2019s an important aspect, given that a 2020 global survey by Ingredion found that more than half of respondents find it important for products to have a short ingredient list. Following up on this, Ingredion\u2019s latest data revealed that 78% would spend more money on products with \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018all-natural\u2019 packaging claims. \u201cWe expect EVERY\u2019s protein to solve a key need for egg white replacement in our alternative meat formulations, with additional benefits including bringing delicious, high-performing foods to consumers,\u201d explained Oscar Alberto Ochoa Gonz\u00e1lez, meat R&D director at Nutresa. While EVERY isn\u2019t the only company working on precision fermentation eggs \u2013 Formo and Onego Bio are making progress on egg alternatives in Europe \u2013 it is by far the largest in the space, having raised over $233M after closing an oversubscribed $175M Series C fundraiser in December 2021 and an undisclosed investment by American actress Anne Hathaway. Green Queen spoke to EVERY CEO Arturo Elizondo and partnerships head Nick Toriello, touching upon egg prices, retail focus, manufacturing abilities, and the environmental impact of its proteins compared to chicken eggs. This interview has been edited for clarity and concision. Courtesy: The EVERY Co Green Queen: You\u2019ve mentioned how EVERY provides stability among price fluctuations for conventional eggs \u2013 could you expand on the production cost of your EVERY EggWhite and price comparison with chicken eggs? Arturo Elizondo: Each day that passes, we are marching down the cost curve. We\u2019ve spent years developing our technology, and we continue to optimise. At this point in time, the next step is capturing economies of scale with dedicated manufacturing. The good news is that there are a number of tailwinds at our backs. Our recently inked collaboration agreement with Grupo Nutresa is evidence of accelerating customer demand. This comes at a time of upward pricing pressure on conventional eggs, driven by global cage-free commitments from the world\u2019s largest food companies, and severe and worsening egg price and supply volatility. Considering the low cost of inputs for precision fermentation and our demonstrated progress in manufacturing scale-up \u2013 we are actively producing at manufacturing-scale fermentation runs of over 100,000 litres \u2013 this backdrop sets a clear path to positive unit economics at scale for EVERY. We are laser-focused on driving large-scale manufacturing to meet the needs of customers like Nutresa, whose products reach more than 80 countries around the world. History supports this forecast, with precedent well established for the rapid and steep adoption of superior products from microbial fermentation such as citric acid, insulin, vitamin B2 and rennet following their introduction to market. GQ: Are you looking to expand into retail too, as well as other countries? Courtesy: Pietran Nick Toriello: We\u2019re leveraging our capacity as the intel inside a wide array of foods to ultimately drive mainstream adoption through large volumes at retail, where our customers\u2019 brands are present. This approach aligns with our purpose to remake the food system from within, delivering mass impact alongside mass adoption of our more humane, hyperfunctional ingredients. For example, Grupo Nutresa\u2019s significant market reach affords EVERY an onramp to deliver increasing volumes of our products across channels and geographies. Our agreement with Nutresa complements core R&D initiatives in Nutresa\u2019s cold-cuts business, with an initial focus on the Zen\u00fa and Pietran brand lines, which are well-established retail brands within the company\u2019s portfolio. GQ: You moved to a new headquarters in April, dubbed \u2018The Hatchery\u2019. What\u2019s your manufacturing capacity now? AE: The purpose of The Hatchery is not to manufacture large volumes of protein: it\u2019s to optimise the manufacturing process and transfer those learnings to our current scaled manufacturing sites. That said, we\u2019ve quintupled our on-site fermentation capacity with the introduction of The Hatchery, our built-for-purpose pilot plant driving targeted manufacturing optimisation. It\u2019s the ideal site to perfect our protein platform and continue improving the blueprint for scaled sites. We recently hired Dr Konrad Mueller-Auffermann, one of the world\u2019s leading experts in beverage, food and biotech process design, to spearhead EVERY\u2019s preparation for further large-scale manufacturing at purpose-built sites. The Hatchery directly supports this work. GQ: How\u2019s your life cycle assessment (LCA) validation process going \u2013 when will the results will be published? NT: We will be publishing more on LCA next year, and look forward to doing so. In the meantime, check out [EVERY scale-up partner] BioBrew\u2019s LCA summary, which includes an overview of outcomes for poultry egg protein from fermentation, compared to conventional animal sources. Courtesy: The EVERY Company GQ: What are your plans for the next year \u2013 any further collaborations or new products in the works? AE: We are always working on new products and collaborations, and have executed several yet-to-be-announced commercial partnerships that will continue to advance our mission to transform the broken food system. We are excited to share more in the near future. Partnering with Nutresa is a pivotal move in our mission to transform the food system and deliver high-quality protein to consumers around the world.","filter_flag":1}

Aside from what we\u2019ve already mentioned, critics rail against Shein for three main reasons: labor conditions, environmental degradation, and offensive designs. Labor Conditions A Channel 4 investigation found that two factories that supply clothes to Shein are in violation of China\u2019s labor laws and Shein's own code of conduct. The network discovered that employees were working 18-hour days with only one day off a month. Pay was also dismally low, with one factory paying just four cents per garment. When asked about its working conditions, a Shein spokesperson told Cheapism that the retailer is \"committed to respecting human rights and adhering to local laws and regulations,\" noting that the company has doubled its spending on its responsible sourcing program. Shein also directed us to its factory wage investigation report, which audited 150 factories (around 2.5% of its producers). In June, Shein faced backlash after sending a group of influencers on an all-expenses-paid trip to its factories in Guangzhou, an attempt to rehabilitate the company's image. While the influencers cheered the working conditions, consumers saw through the public relations stunt and criticized the trips on social media. \"The Shein influencer controversy is embarrassing,\" Imaeyen Ibanga, who works for AJ+, wrote on Twitter. \"The trip isn't free, it's a barter system for good coverage. Investigative journalism isn't a cute phrase. It's real work.\" Following Shein's controversial rebranding campaign, congress released a report titled \"Fast Fashion and the Uyghur Genocide,\" which confirmed that the fast-fashion brand uses its direct-to-consumer model to avoid complying with a ban on imports from China's Xinjiang region, where at least 100,000 Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are being forced to work. Although a Bloomberg report found that lab tests showed that Shein's clothes were made with Xinjiang cotton, the company has both denied that it uses forced labor and has said that it doesn't have suppliers from the Xinjiang Region. Environmental Degradation When consumers shop at Shein, or any other fast fashion store, they see a huge catalog of on-trend, cheap clothes. They don\u2019t see the tons of carbon released into the atmosphere, the trillions of gallons of wastewater, or myriad chemicals released into the environment. But that\u2019s the reality of fast fashion\u2019s business model, regardless of the brand. To put the industry's impact into perspective, fashion companies are responsible for 8 to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the maritime shipping and aviation industry combined. Because fast fashion is predicated on constant demand and disposability \u2014 we have enough clothing already \u2014 it's particularly blameworthy. Although many of these environmental concerns aren\u2019t unique to Shein, a report from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that a Shein jacket for toddlers contained nearly 20 times the amount of lead that Health Canada deems safe for children. Responding to those claims on Twitter, Shein wrote that it was \u201ccommitted to product safety.\u201d \u201cWe regularly test products and take action when non-compliance is found, including terminating suppliers,\u201d the company added. To address critics' environmental concerns, Shein told Cheapism that it is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain by 25% by 2030. (Zara's parent company and H&M have set more ambitious goals, committing to net zero emissions by 2040). Shein has also \"publicly shared its vision of a fully circular textile economy by 2050,\" taking steps such as launching a more sustainable clothing line, a sustainability fund, and a peer-to-peer resale platform, among other minor programs. While many of these gestures seem meaningful, consumers should know that companies often cover up their environmental harm through greenwashing. Case in point: In an assessment that looked at more than 4,000 garments, more than half of companies' sustainability claims were misleading or unsubstantiated, according to Synthetics Anonymous 2.0, a fashion sustainability report. The report also critiqued Shein's peer-to-peer resale platform, citing it as an example of greenwashing. \"Recommence, if not coupled with an increase in quality and a reduction in production volume of clothes, is arguably redundant, and partnerships with resale platforms with limited sustainability strategies are also capped in impact. SHEIN unveiled its new resale programme in October 2022, providing an exemplary case of how \u2018alternative\u2019 business models have been greenwashed,\" the report reads. Offensive Designs Shein has sold a \u201cmetal swastika pendant\u201d and a racist phone case showing a handcuffed Black person outlined in chalk, among other controversial designs. Although the company apologized for both items, it indicates that a lack of oversight is baked into Shein\u2019s speedy business model.","filter_flag":1}

Based on a more natural formula with raw materials of plant and mineral origin, the collection features 12 shades and provides long-lasting hold and shine. According to the company, the addition of fortifying silicone improves the quality of nails. The line is now available in global travel retail. With 60 years of expertise, Mavala follows a philosophy dedicated to care and beauty and sells more than 12 million products annually worldwide. Available in more than 100 countries on five continents, it offers 700 SKUs translated into 30 languages. Founded on the concept of problem-solution since its beginning, the brand\u2019s portfolio delivers clean beauty solutions from head-to-hand-to-toe. Mavala\u2019s Perfect Concealer stimulates blood microcirculation and comes in ergonomic and eco-designed packaging Skincare-infused make-up Newly launched, Mavala\u2019s skincare-infused make-up range includes Serum Foundation, Perfect Concealer and Magic Powder. Said to beautify and unify complexion, Serum Foundation comes in eight shades and is based on a formula full of active ingredients including the Swiss Mallow flower to smooth skin. Targeting dark circles and imperfections, Perfect Concealer stimulates blood microcirculation, strengthens the skin barrier and is described as offering the power of two serums in one concealer. It comes in ergonomic and eco-designed packaging. Both new products have been clinically shown to improve the quality and appearance of skin within one month of application. Finally, suitable for all skin tones, Magic Powder features an anti-blue light benefit to protect skin against urban and digital pollution. According to Doris Maute Bobillier, CEO at Mavala, with beauty and wellness becoming more interconnected, there is a stronger focus on products\u2019 ability not only to enhance natural appearance, but also promote mental and physical wellbeing. This often leads to a brand experience centered on trusted values. With consumers increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of beauty products, Maute Bobillier says Mavala is exploring eco-friendly packaging, sustainable sourcing of ingredients and green manufacturing practices to align with this trend, as well as AI tools. Mavala\u2019s Magic Powder features an anti-blue light benefit Educational tools and lifestyle practices More than a beauty brand, Mavala serves as an educational source on exercise, hygiene and lifestyle practices. The company designs traveler-friendly product sets that feature multi-lingual explanations or QR codes that link to educational videos and information. These materials cover topics such as hand exercises, skincare routines, how-tos and habits for healthy nails and skin. Speaking about how the company promotes its educational side in travel retail Maute Bobillier comments, \u201cThe brand has always put emphasis on teaching users about how to identify their skin, nail or lash concerns, both online and offline, to inform and engage consumers, including travelers. This includes via brochures, in-store displays and digital media where advice related to its beauty and wellbeing products are shared, as well as exclusive live demonstrations that offer travelers a relaxing and educational experience at the same time.\u201d Global Travel Retail Magazine spoke with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Chastenet, Area Sales Manager at Mavala, in Cannes last month about the launch of the brand\u2019s skin-infused make-up range. In line with Maute Bobillier\u2019s comments, de Chastenet said, \u201cWhat is important at Mavala is that we want to use caring ingredients in every product. This includes our make-up line.\u201d Speaking from experience, de Chastenet added that women who use Serum Foundation and Perfect Concealer find the products easy to apply and benefit from greater skin vitality.","filter_flag":1}

In the first two years, 130 businesses, representing over 62% of all clothing products placed on the UK market, have signed up to the agreement, which incorporates science-based targets to transition to a circular textiles economy leveraging the Textiles 2030 Footprint Tool and the Circularity Roadmap. Through the agreement, signatories have pledged ten-year targets of: 50% reduction in the overall carbon footprint of new textile products by 2030 30% reduction in the overall water footprint of new textile products by 2030 Industry collaboration to achieve the Textiles 2030 Circularity Roadmap ambitions However, the results from year two of Textiles 2030 paint a mixed picture. The collective carbon footprint has decreased by 2% in comparison to the baseline year of 2019 but the water footprint has increased by 8% due to the increased amount of cotton used. Cotton fibre production accounts for 84% of the total water footprint. There has also been a 13% increase in the volume of textile products placed on the market since 2019. Topline statistics 2022 2% decrease in collective carbon footprint 130 signatories representing over 62% of textiles placed on the UK market Improvement actions helped to reduce the carbon impact of textiles by 12% and water impact by 4% on a per tonne basis 8% increase in collective water footprint 84% of total water footprint came from cotton fibre production 44% of textiles produced had a lower environmental impact than conventional counterparts 13% increase in volume of textile products placed on the UK market 8% more textiles collected by reuse and recycling organisations Preloved sales equal to 9% of new products sold Read the full report here Reuse and recycling signatories The activities undertaken by reuse and recycling signatories in 2022 helped to reduce 1.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and 385 million cubic metres of water. These significant reductions are largely attributed to sales of recycled and reused products replacing sales of new products (displacement rate). Recent WRAP evidence has allowed an updated displacement rate to be used in year 2 of reporting. Project Re:claim scales up polyester recycling technology The Salvation Army Trading Company (SATCoL) has partnered with Project Plan B on a pioneering new polyester fibre-to-fibre recycling system under Project Re:claim, aimed at reducing textile waste. The installation of the first commercial-scale post-consumer polyester recycling technology at SATCoL\u2019s textile processing centre in Kettering, Northamptonshire, has commenced and operations are due to begin in Autumn 2023. The new system is able to process end of life textiles and turn it into polyester pellets which can then be used to make polyester yarn. In its inaugural year, the machinery is projected to recycle approximately 2,500 tonnes of textiles, with expectations to scale up to 5,000 tonnes in year two.

Above all else, fashion retailers must understand which products consumers want to buy. Only then can they layer on the right brand messaging, channels to communicate, technologies to support and supply chain to fulfil in order to complement that central offer. So what will consumers want to buy three years from now in clothing, footwear and accessories? In the latest analysis from Retail Week\u2019s Fashion Forward: Forecasting the sector\u2019s future design content campaign \u2013 which looks at how consumers will buy clothing across the next three years and is produced in partnership with Bloomreach \u2013 we find out by asking leading retailers. Anica Wislawski, senior head of design, New Look \u201cWe pride ourselves on predicting the trends, so in three years\u2019 time we expect that interchangeability will be what it\u2019s all about for the retail sector. The versatility of our clothes will become even more important and consumers will want multi-use, all-year-round pieces. The seasons are blurring and it\u2019s hotter for longer, so shoppers will be looking for interchangeable wardrobes that can be heat-appropriate but also layer well for later in the year. \u201cOur mixed lifestyles of hybrid working will also play into changing demands for clothing \u2013 sports and athleisure pieces will become a fixed part of wardrobes and comfort will continue to be a deciding purchase factor for many; however, dressing up will always be important to customers. We are also becoming more conscious consumers, and vintage and recycled products are likely to be even more popular for Gen Z and younger generations. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think about how AI will impact the retail sector. Retailers will be able to use the technology to adapt their stores to know exactly what shoppers want before they\u2019ve even stepped inside. We predict that the level of personalisation that retailers will be able to achieve for customers will change the sector forever.\u201d Robbie Feather, retail managing director, The Very Group \u201cEconomic conditions are stretching household budgets and that won\u2019t change soon. Consumers will make more considered purchases, driving demand for seasonless fashion. They\u2019ll want timeless products to wear year-round and style in lots of different ways. Easy layering pieces like trench coats, bomber jackets, and lightweight jumpers will be key. \u201cWith awareness of the environmental impact of our fashion choices on the rise, consumers will want to invest in products that last. Trends will evolve and be around for longer, like the recent revival of utility fashion. Demand for cargos shifted into tailored fabrics and wider legs worn with sweats and knitwear. We\u2019ll see more subtle changes within larger trends. \u201cConsumer appetite for health and wellness is creating a gradual shift in how we dress day to day. Wellness apparel, like leggings, hoodies and joggers, combine comfort, functionality and style. They can be worn to exercise or dressed up for other activities. Brands in this space will thrive. \u201cTech and sportswear will become interlinked. More of us want to elevate our workouts and smart sportswear is on the rise. Demand for garments with built-in chips or responsive tech fibres weaved into fabrics will become widespread. These products connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth, tracking performance.\u201d Ben Smith, chief trading officer, Matalan \u201cFor us, the customer is king. Great product starts with a deep understanding of your customer \u2013 their life, their motivations, their aspirations. All of us who work in retail know that change is the one constant in our sector. But even across a three-year horizon, we can be fairly sure of some fundamentals that will remain. For me, the three biggies are value, service and trust. \u201cValue is about great-quality products at the right price. Versatility and longevity form a big part of value, which is why we think lifestyle ranges in particular will remain in high demand; they just suit our daily lives. \u201cIn terms of service, it\u2019s about providing customers with the ease of shopping whenever and wherever they want. Having great, visually inviting stores and great choice as well as a dynamic online experience will remain key for the coming years. \u201cAnd, last but not least, customers will want to know they are buying products or services from a brand that cares for its people and the communities it touches. This is something that will never change.\u201d Helen White, product and brand director, Bam Bamboo Clothing \u201cAt Bam, we put reducing our impact on people, planet and nature at the forefront of everything we do. Three years from now, we\u2019re expecting consumers to be much more aware of how much activewear has historically been made from fossil-fuel-based virgin polyester, rejecting it in favour of comfortable and high-performing workout gear made with innovative blends of nature-based fabrics, using exciting new materials such as Naia and Amni Soul Eco \u2013 two new fibres with great performance attributes as well as a lower environmental impact, which we\u2019ve used recently in our unique Novea and Flexa ranges. \u201cWe also expect to see the use of new recycled fabric blends, thanks to advances in recycling technology. \u201cAs these new fabrics scale, they will be made available at more accessible price points. Comfort, performance and style will be paramount as more choice in activewear will mean consumer expectations continue to rise. \u201cGenerally, we expect consumers will be demanding much more detail and transparency on where, how and from what their clothes were made, with EU legislation coming into practice also putting pressure on fashion brands. AI could also be a game changer for product traceability by 2026, which is currently opaque, slow and open to fraud.\u201d Sara Bradley, group buying director, N Brown \u201cCustomers will have an expectation for quality pieces and will be looking for products that are made to last in order to maintain their value for resale \u2013 something that has grown in popularity and shows no sign of slowing down. Alongside quality as a measure of value, I think customers will be looking for versatility from the products that they choose to invest in, giving them the option of multiple ways to wear. \u201cI also think there will be a continuation in blurring of formal and casual product as lifestyles evolve. I think we\u2019ll see a continued focus on growth in sports and athleisure on the back of a continued trend for wellness. \u201cFinally, as we\u2019re seeing more extreme and unpredictable weather, customers will be expecting product to be relevant across seasons. This will also increase the need for practicality, with an increased demand for weatherproofing.\u201d Chris Griffin, chief executive, Secret Sales \u201cTo predict what consumers will want to buy, we need to understand the factors that will influence future buyers. As interest rates have soared alongside the cost-of-living crisis and climate concerns have increased, consumers have naturally gravitated to affordability and sustainability. We believe these pillars will continue to be top priorities and will become entrenched in the consumer mindset. \u201cPeople will be looking for great value, good quality and sustainable choices. However, the economic crisis makes it difficult for them to afford full-price, high-quality products and we are seeing customers turn away from cheaply made, non-sustainable products. Off-price inventory addresses these challenges, allowing consumers to purchase quality items at better value for money, which can then be resold after multiple seasons of use, enabling consumers to buy into the circular fashion economy and be more sustainable while still buying quality products. And so, my prediction is that reseller and off-price platforms will see significant growth over the next three years.\u201d Kate Brown, product director, Fat Face \u201cAt Fat Face, we use many factors to understand what is influencing consumer behaviour and impacting fashion trends. The way we live and work has changed dramatically over the past few years, and fashion has been agile and embraced these changes. At Fat Face, our goal is to create clothing in a responsible way that the whole family can live life in. \u201cWe have seen demand grow for comfort and movement within the clothes we design, and we only expect this trend to build momentum over the years to come. Digital evolution, desk-based working and the blend of workspaces means we want our clothes to be adaptable and work hard for us. Categories such as fleece, jersey and knitwear will continue to grow as the end use is versatile, and customers can see great value in the cost per wear. \u201cThe demand for more sustainable clothing will also continue to grow. Customers will buy less but buy better, choosing \u2018buy for life\u2019 designs that are timeless, built to last and created in a responsible way. Big trends at the moment include handcrafted designs, upcycling and repair, which are driven by customers seeking unique designs while extending the life of their most loved pieces.\u201d Laura Watson, chief creative officer, Seasalt \u201cWe aim to make our collections as inspiring as possible as we recognise that our customers connect with colour, pattern and texture on a very emotional and individual level. They want to feel that spark of excitement that will make them feel great in what they\u2019re wearing. \u201cIncreasingly, customers will also want to make sure that they are shopping with brands who demonstrate they care about wider ESG issues and, more importantly, can evidence this. Brands that make vague claims about sustainability will fail. \u201cIt is very important to us that we are making the best possible choices about the fibres and fabrics we use, and strive for those that are the most sustainably accredited. We work hard with our trusted supply base to deliver well-designed, high-quality products that are made to love and last. \u201cThe trend for circularity will increase, so resale (we already have an excellent resale partnership with Reskinned) plus rental and repair will continue to grow. This is currently being led by both the cost-of-living crisis and the sustainability agenda. Repair is currently a key growth area, with consumers encouraged to keep items and \u2018repurpose with a twist\u2019 to give them new life. We have some exciting new projects under way that will enable greater usage of recycled fibres, as well as repurposing post-consumer textile waste. \u201cIn three years\u2019 time, more brands will adopt product passports, allowing more transparency around product sourcing. We are well on the way with mapping our supply chain through all tiers to support this. \u201cAt Seasalt we are constantly applying the learnings from current trade to future seasons in order to make our products as relevant as possible. Climate change is having an impact, with weather patterns shifting, and therefore we need to be able to respond to this with flexibility in our greige fabric and yarn booking and with our manufacturers. I think clothing will become less seasonal and customers will be looking for all-year-round items, particularly in categories like our rainwear.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Sustainable materials and furniture Using sustainable materials and furniture is essential for creating an environmentally-friendly workspace that minimizes its ecological footprint. When designing a co-working space, it is important to consider the materials and furniture used in order to promote sustainability and reduce environmental impact. Opting for sustainable materials means choosing materials that are sourced responsibly, have a low carbon footprint, and can be recycled or reused at the end of their lifecycle. For example, using reclaimed wood for desks and tables not only adds a unique aesthetic to the space, but also reduces the demand for new timber and helps prevent deforestation. Additionally, using furniture made from recycled or upcycled materials can significantly reduce the environmental impact. For instance, chairs made from recycled plastic or fabric made from upcycled materials are great options. These materials not only divert waste from landfills, but also require less energy to produce compared to virgin materials. Furthermore, it is important to choose furniture that is durable and long-lasting. This reduces the need for frequent replacements, ultimately reducing waste. Investing in high-quality, well-designed furniture made from sustainable materials ensures that it will withstand the test of time.

Antolin, the global provider of technological solutions for car interiors, has developed a pioneering project that employs mycelium-based natural materials to help reduce the environmental impact of vehicle components. Mycelium is the vegetative part of fungi, so it is found naturally in terrestrial ecosystems. Thanks to an innovative process, mycelium binds with vegetable residues to develop a structural material with which to produce automotive components. In addition, this form of sustainable production is carbon neutral, as the material development occurs organically directly in the mould, compared to the traditional plastic injection process. The project increases the efficiency of the circular economy and is the natural response to reduce the use of plastic in automotive parts. With this innovation, Antolin contributes to decarbonisation and leverages the infinite resources nature provides, setting a precedent for the automotive industry and helping it be implemented in other sectors. This project also shows how to advance the research of materials and new processes for the automotive industry, with minimal impact on carbon footprints, through the use of 100% biodegradable products at the end of their life cycle, compared to non-biodegradable products that can end up in oceans and rivers. In addition, it gives a second life to waste of natural origin that can be implemented in an industrial setting. By researching these types of solutions, Antolin wants to offer its customers innovative, high-impact proposals, helping them introduce fully sustainable materials, structures and processes into their future vehicle programmes to meet decarbonisation goals across the automotive value chain.","filter_flag":1}
