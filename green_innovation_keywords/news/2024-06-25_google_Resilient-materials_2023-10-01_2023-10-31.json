The region is known for agriculture, aquaculture and handicrafts, with women entrepreneurs playing a significant role. Sector-specific impacts are identified and key recommendations are outlined for improving the climate resilience of MSMEs in the region. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. This is due, in large part, to its geographical location and socioeconomic conditions. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns and more frequent extreme weather events such as cyclones and flooding have significantly impacted the country's economy and people\u2019s livelihoods. Increasing salinity in the coastal areas is a particularly difficult challenge for Bangladesh. The southwestern coastal regions comprise 19 districts that cover 32% of the country\u2019s land area and have a combined population of 35 million people. Seawater is intruding into sources of freshwater, making the water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation. Salinity impacts 26% of the country, making it a significant problem for the agriculture and fisheries sectors, in addition to causing forced migration and displacement of coastal communities that rely on farming and fishing for their livelihoods. MSMEs are important components of the economy in coastal regions. Often the primary source of income and employment for local communities, MSMEs are also highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which impact infrastructure, disrupt supply chains and reduce demand for products and services, making it difficult for them to operate effectively. To address the potential climate financing opportunities for MSMEs, from 2019 to 2021, CDKN Asia implemented a knowledge-basis project, Assessing Investment Opportunities for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in Southwest Bangladesh. The project\u2019s primary objective was to investigate climate change vulnerabilities, existing gender-sensitive adaptation practices and potential adaptation investment options for MSMEs located in the coastal districts of Satkhira, Bagerhat and Khulna. Challenges for MSMEs in coastal districts Satkhira, Bagerhat and Khulna are located in the southwestern region of Bangladesh and have a combined population of more than 12 million people. The region is known for agricultural and aquaculture activities such as rice cultivation, shrimp farming and fishing. The three districts contributed 75% of the total shrimp yield between 2002 and 2017. Most of the economic activities in these districts are driven by MSMEs, which are vital in providing jobs and incomes to the local communities. The project identified the most important sectors among MSMEs, district-wise. In Satkhira, these are shrimp and crab farms, vegetable and fish farms, livestock and poultry, seeds, fertilisers and insecticides, boutiques, tailors, handicrafts and nurseries. In Bagerhat, the sectors include coconut and natural products, shrimp and crab farms, vegetable and fish farms, livestock and poultry, boutiques, tailors and handicrafts. In Khulna, the sectors include agro-processing and frozen foods, jute, handicrafts and women entrepreneurship. Notably, in Khulna, a significant number of women entrepreneurs are active in the handicrafts, tailoring and beauty sectors, generating employment opportunities for women workers. MSMEs in several districts of Bangladesh, including the project areas, face challenges such as limited access to finance, shortages of skilled labour and inadequate infrastructure. Additionally, they grapple with climate change impacts such as flooding, waterlogging, saline intrusion and cyclones. These climate impacts damage infrastructure, disrupt supply chains and reduce the demand for products and services, thus increasing financial and operational challenges for MSMEs and making them more vulnerable. Sectoral impacts The project identified specific sectoral impacts. For instance, shrimp farming is becoming unsustainable due to increasing salinity, drought, declining water quality and various diseases affecting shrimp species. In the livestock and poultry sectors, high temperatures, erratic rainfall and humidity are impacting animal health and production work, necessitating increased training and investments. The handicrafts sector is facing issues of insufficient financing, health problems among workers and climate change impacts on raw materials. These challenges encompass disrupted growth cycles and reduced access to essential materials such as bamboo, jute and wood \u2014 posing challenges for artisans. Changes in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures are affecting jute yield. Furthermore, the scarcity of water supply and poor road infrastructure have contributed to a decline in the production of jute related products. Despite jute's potential as a sustainable and climate-friendly material, it struggles to compete with plastic due to inadequate enforcement of the mandatory Jute Packaging Act. In addition to infrastructure upgrades, there is an urgent need to introduce climate-resilient jute varieties capable of year-round cultivation. Increased cyclones and saline water intrusion result in embankment erosion, reducing their effectiveness in protecting against coastal flooding. Additional investments are required for embankment repairs and improvements. Reinforcing these structures with resilient materials and technologies is crucial to improving their durability and protecting against flooding. For repairing embankments. In the nursery sector, there is a need to invest in training, consultation with experts and modern equipment and to facilitate loans with easier terms as well as better terms for leased land to adapt to changing weather patterns. Investment is also needed for introducing hybrid and resilient varieties of coconuts and betel nuts, the production of which is decreasing due to salinity. Project outcomes and recommendations The project studied the MSMEs' vulnerability to climate change impacts as well as the adaptation measures currently in place. Climate risks such as sea-level rise, flooding and cyclones were identified after in-depth research and consultations with various stakeholders. The assessment of the adaptation practices focused on gender-sensitive approaches that could help ensure that the most vulnerable groups were not left behind. Secondly, the project fostered partnerships between key stakeholders such as governmental organisations, the private sector and non-governmental organisations\/civil society to raise awareness of and promote a coordinated effort towards investment in building climate-resilient MSMEs and to identify such investment options. The project\u2019s findings led to several key recommendations: Key investment areas or additional areas for expenditure by businesses due to climate vulnerability: Relocating plants: Invest in retrofitting or relocating plants, managing hazardous waste, addressing health hazards for workers and dealing with logistical challenges caused by public infrastructure failure. Additionally, they can develop new products such as jute-based items, coconut shell products, handlooms and more. Jute is a natural fibre extracted from the bark of the white jute plant (Corchorus capsularis) and tossa jute (C. olitorius). It is often called the \"Golden Fibre\" due to its shiny appearance. Jute fibre is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable, making it environmentally friendly. Cultivating jute in crop rotations also enriches the soil fertility for the next crop. A hectare of jute plants consumes about 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide and releases 11 tonnes of oxygen. The crop takes around 120 days (from April\/May to July\/August) to fully mature. Hazardous waste: Proper storage and disposal of hazardous waste is crucial to prevent environmental contamination from waterlogging and other climate-related hazards. Significant investment from the government and private sector can help relevant manpower develop their knowledge capacity to manage sustainable hazardous waste management more efficiently in compliance with National and International Guidelines. Health hazards: Investment should cover health hazard costs for workers, as it can significantly affect productivity when employees have health problems. Workers health should be considered for investment because businesses may shift worker costs, but expenses for health, absenteeism and turnover can lead to missed opportunities. Climate resilient species: Immediate action is imperative to prioritise agriculture and livestock species that can withstand the effects of climate change. Significant investment can help grow the aquaculture sector by doing research and introducing climate resilient species for aquaculture (e.g. saline-adaptive shrimp varieties), poultry, livestock or crops (e.g. round-the-year, climate-resistant jute) Facilitating adaptation: Investing in new products to reduce adaptation, such as water desalination plants and jute-based products. New innovative business models: Adoption of new or innovative business models, e.g. mangrove-based pisciculture. Training and capacity building: Investment in training and capacity building of business owners and workers about climate change, vulnerability and adaptation. Adaptation initiatives: Investment in peer learning and up scaling of successful adaptation initiatives. Corporate social responsibility: Investment in corporate social responsibility efforts aligned with adaptation, e.g. reforestation. Minimising the financial gap: It is evident from the project's findings that a multi-faceted approach is required to tackle the challenges encountered by MSMEs in these districts. Crucial measures that are needed for overcoming the issue of creditworthiness include facilitating contacts with financial institutions, identifying risk factors and providing advisory support. Collaboration with research organisations and multi-stakeholder platforms to identify financing gaps as well as recommendations on policy support and financial incentives are also crucial. The development of standards and tools to assess climate vulnerability, adaptation requirements and investment needs can aid in integrating climate considerations into project assessments for financing adaptation investment. Moreover, promoting jute packaging (an environmentally friendly substitute for plastic packaging like jute bags, floor coverings etc.), providing healthcare facilities and organising awareness campaigns to reduce illnesses among workers are measures that are recommended for mitigating climate vulnerabilities and enhancing the overall performance of MSMEs. Conclusion The MSME sector in Bangladesh is a critical component of the economy, with nearly 10 million SMEs contributing 23% to the GDP, 80% of the jobs in the industrial sector and 25% of the total labour force. The World Bank has found that the country has a financing gap of USD 2.8 billion in the MSME sector, with 60% of the women\u2019s SMEs needing more collateral. Improving the MSMEs\u2019 resilience and adaption to climate change is crucial and providing them more access to climate finance can play a vital role in achieving these goals. By promoting the development of climate-resilient businesses and value chains, local economies can become more diversified and less reliant on vulnerable sectors. The project\u2019s valuable outputs and recommendations can help both public and private financial institutions identify the most important investment areas for enhancing the resilience of MSMEs in the southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. They can also provide insights to policymakers and investors into the current state of MSMEs and their exposure to climate risks. Providing climate finance can help to significantly enhance MSMEs' resilience and help them adapt to changing environmental conditions. This can involve improving their access to finance, technical assistance and capacity building to help them implement climate-friendly practices and technologies. Furthermore, climate finance can support the creation of new climate-resilient businesses and value chains that diversify local economies and reduce their dependence on vulnerable sectors. Providing climate finance to MSMEs in coastal areas can result in a more resilient and sustainable economy. Most importantly, by analysing the economic, social and environmental factors that affect MSMEs' performance and sustainability, the project has identified potential areas for investment that could help build their climate resilience.","filter_flag":1}

The M11S offers a monster battery, top-of-the-line wired and wireless options, and the ability to use your favorite streaming services. Paired with a respectable output level, it\u2019s none too shabby. FiiO\u2019s options here are generally the options with the largest batteries that you can find under $1000, so it\u2019s no surprise that the latest addition to the company\u2019s line would stack up against the competition this way. The main reason you\u2019d want something else is if you really desperately needed higher power output than the M11S can offer, and that would mean making tradeoffs in the price or features department. FiiO M11S FiiO M11S Battery life \u2022 Wired and Wireless \u2022 Streaming service compatibility MSRP: $499.99 High-power, high-res MP3 player The FiiO M11S is a high-performance, high-res MP3 player. This Android powered device has a large battery, 5-inch display, multiple connection ports, and can play many music file formats. See price at Amazon Save $0.99 Why is the FiiO M11S the best portable music player? Paying many thousands of dollars for a portable music player is often only going to get you very small improvements at significant cost\u2014so we\u2019re going to advise you to not do that. While the FiiO M11S might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, it does tick all the boxes for a good portable audio player that can also handle pretty much anything you throw at it (including most streaming services). To be clear, this is a unit that isn\u2019t going to be a perfect match for all headphones; it\u2019s just the right tool for most of them. FiiO M11S Storage 32GB (expandable to 2TB) DAC ES9038Q2m\u00d7 2 Output ports USB-C, 3.5mm TRS, 2.5mm balanced, 4.4mm Pentaconn Files supported DSD64\/128\/256, DXD, APE, ALAC, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, WMA, MP3, OGG, AAC, MQA BT codecs SBC\/AAC\/APTX\/APTX-HD\/LDAC\/LHDC Battery 5300mAh Android version 10 Equalizer Parametric, user-defined bands Input ports USB-C Output power 300mW 3.5mm port, 550mW 2.5 and 4.4mm ports FiiO does a pretty good job of making the most of the components crammed into this unit, as it provides a parametric equalizer to customize your sound to your liking or even use presets from others online. Additionally, you can use this unit as a stand-in for a DAC and amp for your computer. Really, there aren\u2019t very many features for portable music players not on the M11S, so this is an easy recommendation. This unit will satisfy the vast majority of use cases that even a highly demanding user would throw at it, save for waterproofing or ultra-high output. If you\u2019re using headphones that require more than a watt of juice to reach an appropriate level, you\u2019re going to want to look for something else. Just like any other portable audio player, you need to match what your needs are to the right product first. However, unless you\u2019re running super insensitive planar magnetic headphones or some ultra-boutique options, chances are extremely good that you don\u2019t need a super high output source. For most people, that makes the FiiO M11S\u2014the cheapest portable music player that has all the best features music players can offer\u2014the best portable music player. We decided against the FiiO M11 Plus because the upgrades it offers really aren\u2019t worth the extra $175 unless you\u2019re deep in the rabbit hole of portable audio already. Stacking an extra 10mW of output power and 700mAh to the battery is notable. Still, considering the M11S already has a decent output level and battery, you\u2019re not likely to notice much change unless you have super power-hungry headphones. If you\u2019re on a budget, get the Hidizs AP80 The Hidizs AP80 Pro is quite small. Even if you don\u2019t have a ton of cash to burn on this endeavor, you can, in fact, get pretty much everything you\u2019re looking for in a portable music player at a fairly \u201clow\u201d cost. The Hidizs AP80 is a rather unassuming square-shaped device with limited bells and whistles. However, it does tick all the boxes you could want in a portable music player outside of raw power. But even then, we were able to drive the Sennheiser HD 800 S and Meze Audio Liric without any issues. If you need a unit capable of higher output, you\u2019re likely going to be looking at devices in a higher price bracket. This portable audio player might be tiny, but it offers FLAC playback, LDAC, expandable storage up to 2TB via microSD, and, you guessed it: a headphone jack. There are two upgrade options for the AP80 if you decide you\u2019d like something better, but the increase in cost is not likely to be worth the money if you\u2019re looking for major upgrades. Model AP80 AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X Model Storage AP80 1TB AP80 Pro 512GB AP80 Pro-X 512GB Model DAC AP80 Saber ES9218P AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X Saber ES9218P (x2) Model Output AP80 70mW (32\u03a9) AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X 70mW (32\u03a9), 190mW balanced Model Files supported AP80 AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X Up to 32-bit\/384kHz FLAC, WAV, AIFF, MP3, ALAC, AAC, WMA, OGG, DSF, DSD, DIFF, APE Model BT codecs AP80 AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X SBC, AAC, aptX, LDAC Model Battery AP80 AP80 Pro AP80 Pro-X 800mAh While this may be the \u201cbest\u201d in the budget category on paper, what you\u2019re saving in money, you\u2019re spending in effort. The player doesn\u2019t automatically update its library every time you add to the microSD card, and you\u2019ll also have to figure out how to set the auto-shut-off feature. Otherwise, the AP80 will just stay on in perpetuity. But once you\u2019ve smoothed out these rough spots, you can use the AP80 as a headphone amp\/DAC for your computer, an FM radio, or just the thing you bought it for \u2014 a portable audio player. Hidizs AP80 Hidizs AP80 Price \u2022 Hi-Res audio support \u2022 MicroSD storage MSRP: $199.99 An ultra-portable and affordable high-res MP3 player The Hidizs AP80 is a compact music player that has expandable storage, can operate as a DAC\/amp for your PC, and support high-res audio formats. See price at Amazon Need power? The iBasso DX170 has you covered Black rectangles seldom look amazing, but the iBasso DX170 looks fine enough. While it doesn\u2019t have the same \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d approach as the FiiO, the iBasso DX170 has a lot of power under the hood. The iBasso DX170 has the highest output level on this list and comes in at a full $50 cheaper than the FiiO M11S. That makes it a good match for someone who\u2014for whatever reason\u2014really, really needs more power. Of course, this could describe audiophiles who love to EQ their tunes with extreme adjustments either way, so if you\u2019re a tinkerer, you may want to go this route instead. Some users have reported that they\u2019re unsatisfied with how cheap the DX170 feels in person, and to that, we\u2019d like to note that with a price lower than its closest competition, the cost savings had to come from somewhere. For the utilitarian out there, it may not be such a big deal. However, anyone looking for a luxury product may want to look at higher-end iBasso options if you\u2019re a fan of their schtick. Just note that you don\u2019t need to use that \u201cburn-in cable\u201d included in the packaging. iBass DX170 iBass DX170 Price \u2022 Connectivity options MSRP: $449.00 Competitively priced high-end MP3 player The iBasso DX170 has a lot of power under the hood. High output levels matched with a very competitive price make this an ideal MP3 player for some users. See price at Amazon The SanDisk Clip Sport Plus is a good gym buddy Christian Thomas \/ SoundGuys Of course, if you don\u2019t need a lot of power, maybe you just need a bog-standard MP3 player like the old days. That\u2019s where the SanDisk Clip Sport Plus comes in. This little fella can clip onto your shirt or armband and store 32GB (there are smaller models, too) of tunes for your workout. Additionally, it\u2019s sweat-resistant with an IPX5 rating. While it\u2019s quite a bit cheaper than the other entries here, the SanDisk Clip Sport Plus isn\u2019t exactly aimed at someone looking to replace a computer or a smartphone for their tunes. This is a product to remove all thought necessary for someone who just wants to use the earbuds or headphones they always work out with and now need a solution with a headphone jack. There\u2019s no card slot, there\u2019s no high-power amplifier, and there\u2019s definitely no streaming support from any of the main music streaming services. However, as this product is a great deal less expensive than a phone (not to mention less of a tragedy if it breaks), it\u2019s a good companion for a workout.

See price at Amazon Save $20.99 What makes a good portable music player? It\u2019s rough to admit, but the MP3 player is a bit of a relic of the past. If you want a portable music player, chances are the actual things you need it to do are fairly limited in scope and easy to accomplish. Consequently, this is one of those products that you can absolutely just check for the things you want on a specifications page and simply grab whatever suits your needs. There\u2019s no right or wrong DAC chip to get\u2014just whatever works for your needs and budget. Lily Katz \/ SoundGuys Smartphones used to be the answer, and then the headphone jack went away. A portable music player won\u2019t need to stand in as your primary entertainment device, so you really just need something with a headphone jack, decent battery life, and the ability to store your library of music. What questions you need to answer Here\u2019s the info you need to track down before buying a digital audio player: How much power do you need? What formats are your tunes in your library? Do you need access to a streaming service? If so, you\u2019re going to need a player with Wi-Fi (or perhaps even a fork of Android). What headphone connection do you need? Do you want a balanced output? Nice upgrades are going to take the form of things like an expandable memory slot (microSD) or Bluetooth connectivity over advanced codecs like aptX or LDAC. Additionally, you may see different DAC chips from companies Texas Instruments, Sabre, or Burr Brown. Truth be told, you\u2019re unlikely to notice a difference there, so don\u2019t let that be the deciding factor for you. There are other specs you may want to pay attention to, such as battery size, bit depth and sample rate supported, power output, file types supported, and internal file capacity.

The vast majority of headphones out there aren\u2019t going to need a ton of power. What is the difference between balanced and unbalanced? Is unbalanced bad? Hobbyists love their bespoke equipment, and headphones are no exception. Some boutique headphones require a balanced connection using either a 2.5mm 4-pole TRRS or a 5-pole 4.4mm Pentaconn. These aren\u2019t going to work if you shove them into a normal headphone jack. You\u2019ll need the correct port on your device, or you\u2019ll need a dongle to get headphones with these cable terminations to operate. However, there\u2019s a growing number of portable audio players that can accommodate these connections. The Sennheiser HD 660S comes with 2 cables and an adaptor, providing 3 different connector options. The difference between a balanced and unbalanced connection is in how the signal is treated on the way to your ears. Balanced connections will make use of a concept called differential signaling to supposedly tamp down noise introduced by interference from outside. In contrast, unbalanced connections will simply take the single-ended audio signal from your source without doing that. While it sounds like it might offer a huge improvement, decent shielding on your cables (which should be assumed at this point) should mean that there isn\u2019t any significant difference between the two strategies as far as noise is concerned. For headphones, at least. If you don\u2019t have a balanced connection, you really don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Are you sure you even want a portable music player? Many people looking for portable music players are looking to use their favorite headphones with something they can carry and would drop the idea in a hot second if their smartphones could keep up. Now that the headphone jack is extremely rare in smartphones, it\u2019s entirely possible that what some people are looking for isn\u2019t a portable music player but a USB dongle. If you just want the headphone jack back, there are cheaper options than a portable music player. These devices are generally a lot cheaper than portable music players, and they allow your smartphone to be the music player you want it to be. As always, products like this are mainly spec-driven, so any will work so long as they can meet the power requirements of your headphones\u2014and the only hookup necessary is to use the USB-C port of your Android phone. Apple users will need to specifically look for units that have lightning connectors\u2014though 9 times out of 10, you\u2019ll be happy with the Apple 3.5mm dongle. There\u2019s also no need to overspend here, as even the cheapest units on the market are often powerful enough to drive higher-end options like the Sennheiser HD 800 S and even some planar magnetic headphones like the HiFiMan Sundara without any trouble. It\u2019s one of those situations where the tech behind this sort of thing has gotten so good that it\u2019s a non-issue at this point, and features are going to be what differentiates the models\u2014not performance. Why would you get a portable music player instead of using your phone? Now that the headphone jack has disappeared from smartphones, there\u2019s a small but vocal segment of music lovers that need a way to use their wired cans that isn\u2019t tied to a computer. In fact, I\u2019m one of these people. I often find myself traveling around with dubious access to the internet, and streaming access is poor at best. Ever drive across the great plains? Not so great cell reception there, is it? It's one of those things that you'll likely never need\u2014until you do. While you could absolutely load up your phone with downloaded songs, you\u2019re then fighting space issues if you don\u2019t have a microSD card slot\u2014something that is also going the way of the dinosaur. Even though this is mainly a problem for people who listen to higher bitrate files to the exclusion of all else, it\u2019s still a concern for those who fill their phone\u2019s storage with other things, like movies, photos, or apps. Having a portable audio player on hand will allow you to not only offload the responsibility for your music playback onto a device that isn\u2019t hamstrung by your data connection (or storage) but there are a number of other capabilities you can unlock. For example, smartphones aren\u2019t amazing with high-end headphones. Still, a portable audio player with a high-current output can handle just about any headphones you want in your hotel room, cabin, or other destination. What are some alternatives? Of course, our impulse to prioritize function and cost above all other concerns may not be what you\u2019re looking for, or maybe you just want something that fits your niche a little better. That\u2019s fine! Here are a few other models that you can check out: Shanling M0 Pro: This unit was well received upon its release last year but doesn\u2019t do much to set itself apart from the Hidizs AP80 Pro. It\u2019s still a decent unit, though. Astell & Kern KANN Alpha: a pricy unit, this product prioritizes raw output power. If you have headphones that just can\u2019t get loud enough with other products, this is pretty much the portable that\u2019s most likely to satisfy you. iBasso DX240: Think the DX170 but with a bigger battery and more storage capacity. Sony NW-A306-B: A straightforward music player that undercuts the high-end in price but falls short when it comes to power output. Sony NW-ZX507: Sony\u2019s recent attempt to make a powerful portable. 100+mW output means overkill for most headphones at normal listening volumes. FiiO M11 Plus: This product is much like the M11S but with a bigger battery and higher output. This list is not exhaustive and will expand as we get to experiment with new products as they are released. However, this is a decent cross-section of what\u2019s available and worth your money.
