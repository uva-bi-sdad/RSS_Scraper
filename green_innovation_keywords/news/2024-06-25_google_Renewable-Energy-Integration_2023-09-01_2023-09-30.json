It is true that India has a very large population of engineering talent, but the quality of this talent needs a closer look. I feel that the current education system in India does not prioritize the development of practical skills, leaving graduates with a qualification that lacks hands-on knowledge. Take for example a computer science degree. Most graduates acquire theoretical knowledge of basic programming and algorithms but have not been able to transfer that knowledge to a real-world setting. Part of the problem is the college curriculum in most institutions, which has not been revised often enough to keep up with the rapidly evolving industry. The problem may also lie in professionals\u2019 lack of genuine interest in engineering. Engineering is arguably the most commonly pursued career track in the country. However, the majority of the students pursue it as an outcome of groupthink. Very often, the perceived extensive industry opportunities and potential future pay scale push parents to encourage their child to pursue it while the child may not be truly interested in it. In this case, the student gets through the degree, meeting the bare minimum requirements which leads to subpar skills upon graduation. To address the demand-supply and skills gaps, a comprehensive approach is needed. Educational reforms, a cutback in intake in each graduating class, stronger requirements for institutions, and imparting of skills in the curriculum are needed in the education sector. For outside campus placements, graduates must be aware of the diverse opportunities and acquire the skills necessary in the job market. The reason behind unemployed engineers shifting to other sectors is two-fold. Firstly, lack of demand as compared to supply pushes graduates to explore broader career options in areas such as management, finance or entrepreneurship. This shift is an effect of the dearth of career opportunities. Secondly, changing societal expectations encourage graduates with passions outside of their degree to pursue fields of their identified talent and passion. This is a positive outcome and will hopefully result in a smaller but higher skilled graduate class in the years to come. Companies value experienced professionals, but they also recognize the potential in fresh engineering graduates. While they typically expect subject knowledge, they also value an individual\u2019s ability to learn, and grasp new concepts. Organizations are more inclined to hire and invest in engineers who demonstrate a proactive attitude towards learning, adaptability and staying current with industry trends. While experience is valuable, a strong foundation and eagerness to learn are equally important for young engineers to secure great job opportunities.\u201d Harmeet Chauhan, Global Head \u2013 Engineering Edge, Wipro Limited. \u201cThe future of engineering talent in India is bright, driven by a young workforce, sustained economic momentum, and disruptive technologies.
