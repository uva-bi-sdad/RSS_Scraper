This Program, slated to continue until July 2024, is the first carbon-neutral green practice in the vaping industry, aiming to demonstrate VAPORESSO's innovative efforts towards sustainable development in the age of carbon neutrality and underscore its pivotal role in the industry as a trailblazer for sustainable practices. Innovative Concept ECO NANO to be Low-Carbon Pioneer VAPORESSO has been consistently pushing the boundaries of innovation, leveraging its robust technological capabilities. Working alongside industry experts and researchers, the brand has assessed the potential of various innovative, low-carbon and environmentally-friendly materials. As a result, VAPORESSO has successfully developed four groundbreaking concept ECO NANO products. These products take a step further based on VAPORESSO's ECO NANO that can be refilled and recharged, which lowers users' cost and minimizes the environmental impact. Moreover, they use more eco-friendly materials for production, further reducing carbon emissions, making these products genuine trailblazers and pioneers of sustainable practices in the industry. Among these four conceptual innovative products, \"OceanGLINT\" ECO NANO is the first ocean-friendly product in the vaping industry. It uses PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) material, a leading low-carbon option derived from recyclable marine plastic waste, and can protect the marine environment and reduce carbon emissions by over 40%. Three other concept products use innovative materials for the first time, including biodegradable PLA (Polylactic Acid) materials, PBAT (Polybutylene adipate terephthalate) sugarcane fiber composite, inorganic substances and thermoplastic resins, setting a new industry standard by reducing carbon emissions and contributing to the Earth's sustainable development. Initiatives to Engage More People Worldwide and Promote Environmental Sustainability Through this Program, VAPORESSO is committed to brand responsibility and strives to achieve a balance between industry growth and environmental sustainability. By encouraging its users, clients, and stores to participate in carbon-neutral, eco-friendly practices, VAPORESSO is set to promote green and low-carbon development as a leading brand in the vaping industry. UNITE TO PLANT VAPORESSO has set up an engaging online platform where conceptual innovative products are showcased, and users can learn about and contribute to low-carbon environmental protection through interactive quizzes. By providing users with insights into environmental protection, VAPORESSO aims to increase users' environmental awareness through this interactive experience. From December 10-31, each day, users who correctly answer three questions related to low-carbon environmental protection will be contributing to VAPORESSO's tree-planting initiatives. Participants also stand a chance to win a variety of exciting prizes, such as a DJI AVATA, GoPro, and eco-friendly sets. COLLABORATION WITH GLOBALLY RENOWNED ORGANIZATION FOR TREE PLANTING Partnering with ONETREEPLANTED and China Green Foundation, from December 10-25, VAPORESSO invites more than 140 of its key clients to become its Global Green Partners. By linking clients and users, VAPORESSO will plant 6,000 more trees in the coming months to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while contributing 66 tons of carbon to the Earth's carbon sink annually. With VAPORESSO as a leading force, they are working closely to build a low-carbon and environmentally friendly ecosystem for the vaping industry. VAPE STORE ACTIVITIES \u2013 STEP COUNT CHALLENGE VAPORESSO has also garnered positive responses from over 500 stores globally, aiming to create a mutually beneficial industrial ecosystem. This initiative leads consumers towards adopting a green and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, they are preparing incentive prizes for participants, fostering a positive interaction among stores, consumers, and the brand itself.

I\u2019ve been on the lookout for innovative and sustainable personal care products for most of my adult life, and I may have finally found what I\u2019ve been looking for in Boie USA\u2018s range of bath essentials. From face and body scrubbers to toothbrushes, Boie has created a line of products that deliver functionality and contribute to a more eco-friendly approach to hygiene and product consumption. However, for me, the shining star has to be the Body Scrubber. The best part? New York Post readers get a discount! From March 15, 2024 to March 18, 2024, you can enjoy 15% off your order as part of Boie\u2019s USA\u2018s Saint Patrick\u2019s Day sale! As someone who struggles with dry skin, especially in the winter, I often turn to loofahs or washcloths for a good scrub down. They always feel too rough and irritating or too soft and ineffective \u2014 not to mention how much bacteria they hold on to, even if they\u2019ve been cleaned. The Boie Body Scrubber is made from a BPA-free material embedded with medical-grade silver, making it antimicrobial and clean every time I go for it. From my first encounter, the scrubber\u2019s unique texture spoke volumes. Its flexible, soft-touch feels like a gentle caress, but the results are supremely smooth and thoroughly clean skin (all without the bells and whistles of elaborate skincare gadgets). The Body Scrubber constantly showcases its durability. With its hook, which easily sticks to your shower wall, it\u2019s accustomed to regular wear and tear \u2014 except it doesn\u2019t wear or tear. Of course, like anything that lives in a humid place, the brand recommends replacing it every six months. When that time comes around, just stick it in a shipping envelope and send it back to Boie, where they\u2019ll recycle it with their proprietary process, keeping the scrub party going. Its robust design has seamlessly integrated into my routine, requiring minimal effort for maximum skin-clearing impact. Sustainable choices, it seems, can coexist with convenience and function, debunking the myth I believed that being eco-friendly meant compromising efficacy. Boie USA In the ever-evolving landscape of personal care, where new products promise revolutionary experiences, Boie\u2019s Body Scrubber, Facial Scrubber, and Toothbrush emerge as beacons of simplicity and sustainability. They\u2019re not merely tools for cleanliness; they\u2019re conscious steps toward a more responsible and eco-friendly shower routine. Real smooth operators for your skin and oral health, they\u2019re gentle, effective, and more recyclable than a soda can. The brand completely bypasses municipal recycling programs (which only end up recycling about 9%) by doing their own thing. And the best part? Boie\u2019s sustainability isn\u2019t a compromise on quality. Boie doesn\u2019t just talk the talk; they walk the walk when it comes to eco-friendly practices. The brand\u2019s devotion to the environment extends to every corner of its ethos. Picture this: a shower routine where every element, from scrubber to packaging, your facial exfoliator to your toothbrush, is not only designed well enough to show off but is fully recyclable via the brand\u2019s own provided compostable mailers. Boie USA In a world flooded with skincare tools and options, Boie stands tall as the embodiment of responsible luxury (without the price tag!). The Body Scrubber is not just a purchase; it\u2019s a pledge \u2013 a promise to indulge in self-care while being a steward of the environment. Boie is your ticket to a sustainable skincare love affair. Pros Sticks to shower wall for easy placement mid-scrub down It comes with a hook for easy storage and drying Cons Finger\/hook holes take some time to get the hang of using when scrubbing Boie USA The Face Scrubber, and the rest of the Boie suite of products, is more than a beauty tool; it\u2019s a small revolution in personal care, urging us to rethink our daily rituals. Pros Softer bristles than the Body Scrubber Ergonomically curved to suit the crevices of the face Ring on the back for easy handling and maximum control Cons Because of the ring backing, it\u2019s harder to store in between uses. I recommend using the hook for the Facial Scrubber, too. Boie USA The toothbrush is no exception to Boie\u2019s performance meets aesthetics. With its replaceable heads and equally as recyclable parts (just mail into Boie using the brand\u2019s compostable mailers), it\u2019s the perfect dental hygiene solution for the whole family. Pros Extremely easy to clean after each use, thanks to the slippery material Available in 6 colors, making it perfect for the whole family Ergonomic shape is easy to hold and handle and keeps bristle end away from countertops \u2014 why aren\u2019t all toothbrushes shaped this way? Cons No specific storage is included other than your usual toothbrush holder Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.","filter_flag":1}

This strategic move underlines the company's unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability and aligns with the broader industry shift towards eco-friendly practices. A cornerstone of Ineos Inovyn's ambitious journey towards carbon neutrality is Biovyn, an innovative bio-attributed PVC that made its debut in the market in 2019. Positioned as a pivotal element in the company's sustainability initiatives, Biovyn holds the potential to evolve into a carbon-neutral and net-zero solution. Its versatility is evident in diverse applications across various sectors, ranging from automotive and construction to medical and fashion. In response to the imperative for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, Ineos Inovyn introduces Neovyn, a novel PVC range distinguished by a substantially reduced carbon footprint. According to the company, Neovyn achieves an impressive 37% reduction compared to the European industry average for suspension PVC, translating to a lower carbon footprint of 1.3 kilograms CO2 per kilogram PVC.

It is the world\u2019s oldest society and has a declining population due to a low birth rate. In fact, experts believe that the population will dip under 100 million by 2050. This is creating two key issues in our opinion; the first is a labor crisis, and the second is a shrinking domestic market. How is Mitsubishi Corporation Plastics (MCP) reacting to these demographic changes? In your opinion, how much do you need to look overseas in order to secure the business continuity of your firm? In the current situation the Japanese population is decreasing as you said, but in my opinion that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is going to be a dramatic drop. Currently, the population of Japan sits around 120 million, and while that number isn\u2019t going to increase, we believe we can still maintain our obligations. In terms of the supply side, there are some threats from overseas countries like China, South Korea, and Taiwan, but within the domestic market, there are some industries that are expected to have structural revolutions. If there is restructuring the size of companies or the industry as a whole might shrink. In that case, supply orders might decrease, so in that sense, we would have to go overseas to conduct more business. We are in a fortunate position where we can leverage the network of our parent company in order to conduct more business abroad. I think this is a very big advantage that our company holds over some competitors. Over the past 25-30 years Japan has faced the threats you mentioned from China, Korea, and Taiwan, who have replicated Japanese manufacturing processes, but done so at a cheaper labor cost, thus pushing Japan out of certain mass industrial markets. However, we still see Japanese firms such as yourselves as leaders in certain niche, B2B fields. With this in mind, can you tell us the main strengths of MCP? How is MCP able to compete with regional competitors despite the stiff price competition? The world we live in today is becoming more and more aware of environmental concerns. Japan is part of that movement and we are aware as a nation that things need to change. There is no choice and countries all over the world must become more eco-friendly. A big example of an industry that needs to change is plastic, the industry we are in. We as a company are in a situation where we have to implement eco-friendly materials in order to survive. As this environmental movement continues to gather steam we will need to catch as much information as possible so that we can provide information to our clients in advance. This allows them to prepare and become a part of this movement. I think another strength of MCP is our ability to respond to societal changes. I think that bio-polypropylene derived from sugarcane is a great example of what you just mentioned. In fact, we\u2019ve met with Daio Paper who are developing cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), which is a plant-based material that can mimic plastic and is used in automotive applications such as bumpers. Can you give us your perspective on how close or how far we are from transitioning fully to plant-based and environmentally friendly plastic materials? What are some of the key products you are working on in this regard? First I would like to share some of the strengths of trading companies in general. As a trader we are actually facing various markets directly, so we think that is a strength. Even when we talk about eco-friendly, each client or industry has different purposes. Unfortunately, I think the big disadvantage of bio-materials in general is the cost. You might be aware of the 3Rs, those being reuse, reduce, and recycle. Over the past 30 years, we have been trading plastics, but we feel it might be difficult to fully permeate the complete use of only bio-derived plastics. This is because the use of plastic has accumulated over 30 plus years now. However, as a company that is facing the market directly, we can better understand the preferences of customers and clients. Our mission is to meet the market needs, and although it may be through 3R products or bio-derived materials, it is not really our decision to make, that is for the customers to decide. The market will make the decision and we will respond accordingly by making more investments and focusing our efforts in the direction decided. Right now we are not at that phase yet, and I personally feel that the serious environmental movement only started a couple of years ago. As a trader, we feel we have the flexibility needed to adjust to the whims of the market. With the growth in demand for sustainable solutions, each of your businesses has incorporated some ecological lines of conduct depending on your client\u2019s needs. How do you align the products you offer with your client\u2019s goals without impacting the level of quality? I think this is something that our clients actually need to decide themselves. The onus is on the brand owners and plastic fabrication is one step before the brand owner gets hold of the products. The bottles and the caps are actually made by different manufacturers and our company is providing the resin to local manufacturers who are fabricating the caps of bottles. Local manufacturers are actively exploring the production of eco-friendly goods, even if it means slightly higher costs. The rationale behind this approach is the belief that consumers are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly products, making it a potentially successful brand strategy. To address your question, the extent to which companies align their products with eco-friendly practices largely hinges on their brand strategy. We engage with these brand owners to gain a deeper understanding of their commitment to eco-friendly production and materials. It's important to note that certain products in Japan are highly advanced and robust, which can make it challenging to introduce additional eco-friendly features or enhancements. In contrast, more general products offer greater flexibility in terms of incorporating eco-friendly elements. Notably, our company has earned the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), a globally recognized sustainability certification system that oversees guaranteed biomass supply chains. This ISCC certification holds particular significance in Europe and empowers us to offer customers a broader array of options if they align with the ISCC system. It is interesting that globalized standardization isn\u2019t always accepted in Japan. As Japan\u2019s legislation tightens and disposal options diminish, waste management is becoming a very increasing challenge in many industries. Having a domestic and international vision, the regulatory aspect is one that is always changing and shifting. How do you help your clients navigate the stressful and complex legislation involved in integrating a more circular economy? Awareness of the environment is growing globally, and more and more people are becoming aware of eco-friendly options for the products they buy on a daily basis. In Japan, there are many companies that have committed to reducing their carbon emissions with the eventual goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 or 2050. It means that most companies are very aware that carbon emission reduction is something we have to do and can\u2019t ignore. Right now, for MCP, we aren\u2019t actually sure which method will be the best for our company. As you mentioned, one of our missions as a company is to provide options to our clients, so there are a few strategies we have in terms of giving them the advice and options they need. The first strategy is to urge clients to get on board with CO2 emission reduction, otherwise, they might not make it by 2030. Although many companies have made commitments, I personally don\u2019t feel that they really see what is going on in the world. If we don\u2019t do anything collectively until the last minute, then it is going to be too late. We are asking clients to start moving and putting policies in place before they are left behind. The other strategy relates to the domestic market, and the Japanese government is currently becoming much more serious about environmentally friendly initiatives for businesses. They believe that this activity will affect the growth of Japan. In particular, they are focusing on hydrogen and ammonia. In terms of carbon taxes, we believe that they can be collected and utilized for exporting businesses. It might be introduced by the Japanese government very shortly because the government wants more money for investment into eco-friendly technologies. In the short-term carbon tax might mean more expenditures but in the long term, it can reduce various other taxes. We explain to customers that right now eco-friendly technologies and products are high in cost, but once the tax is introduced costs will be reduced. Automobiles is one of the major sectors that you cater to, and as you are aware it is undergoing a huge transition with the adoption of EV and hybrid vehicles. Here in Japan, we know that 2035 was set by the former Prime Minister Suga\u2019s administration and all cars must be either an EV or a hybrid vehicle. With this transition, we are seeing new material trends and new entities enter the market. As a trading company, how are you catering to the new demands firstly, in terms of products for the automotive industry, and secondly, in terms of new types of customers internationally for your business? When people think of plastic, they tend to think of materials that harm the environment, but with lightweight materials such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), we can actually make vehicles much more fuel efficient and thus much better for the environment. This is an arena we feel we can make contributions, and we are able to provide resins to meet the new demands of the industry. In terms of the automotive industry, we do have a lot of business with certain Automotive manufacturers, and recently they have shown a lot of interest in the recycling business. There are so many ways to recycle in the automotive industry. One example is when cars involved in serious crashes need to be scrapped due to safety concerns. Those cars can be segregated into their materials and then those materials can then be recycled for use in new vehicles. This sort of recycling movement is now gaining a lot of traction within the industry. We work closely with tier-1 and tier-2 companies to provide them with materials. When they receive products from us they often check the quality of the materials, so I think together with those companies we can make significant contributions to the recycling industry. This is what I feel is the best approach to permeating the recycling movement throughout the automotive industry as a whole. We know that in Japan R&D spending is very strong and Japanese companies have historically been able to create amazing products. As a country, Japan is investing around 3% of the GDP into R&D, a significant jump from China\u2019s 1.5% and the US\u2019s 2%. Being a trading company you are essentially the gatekeepers to all the needs of your clients and thus are able to get a better sense of the evolving needs of the industries you cater to. To what extent does the influence of the other Mitsubishi Group companies help the development of new products? Are there any new trends or products that you are developing right now that you would like to showcase for us today? We are a trading company, so we don\u2019t really do any R&D per se, but we do want to have a better grasp of what is happening in Europe with recycling initiatives. The intention is to provide recycled materials both domestically and in international markets. We do have partnerships with several tier-1 and tier-2 companies that manufacture plastic parts. Those companies have their own research and development projects so we do try to assist by providing eco-friendly materials including recycled for them to check and compare to completely new materials. If a material quality is verified through these checks then we feel confident to introduce it to the market. What role do partnerships play in your business model? Are you looking for any new partnerships either domestically or overseas? I think right now is to concentrate for the current project with current partners. Regarding polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle recycling, we have made an investment with our parent company for collection at factories. We do have an overseas partner that we have been working with for a long time now in Thailand. In terms of the cost, Thailand is much cheaper especially when compared to Japan. When it comes to PET recycling, we produce flakes in Japan, while we consider several options for customer\u2019s choice are taking PET flakes to Taiwan for mechanical recycling and Thailand for chemical recycling. The key to finding a partner in my opinion is finding someone that matches our mindset and strategies, so in that sense, it is important to establish trust and a long-lasting relationship. This allows us to continue to make investments in this relationship in the future. Right now though, as I mentioned, the timing isn\u2019t there, so we are looking to see how the market moves before establishing more overseas partnerships. I think unfortunately it is still early days. We know that 46% of your revenue actually comes from overseas. Are you planning to expand more into maybe Europe or the US in the future? When it comes to our overseas business opportunities we need to think about geographical risks. A good example is China and the US which are very conflicted with each other right now. This needs to be considered before taking any opportunities overseas. I think when taking those risks into consideration, the US actually has a low amount of risk when compared to Europe right now, and that is because of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Southeast Asia might actually be easier for us all things considered. Imagine that we come back on the very last day of your presidency and have this interview all over again. What goals or dreams do you hope to achieve by the time you are ready to hand the baton onto the next generation of MCP executives? I think my core mission as president of MCP is to change the culture. As a company, I think we have already grown beyond our parent company\u2019s initial expectations and we are now moving on to the next phase. For those who have worked for the company for a long time it might be difficult to change the way they think or work, but having said that, our new eco-friendly businesses are the new strategy that the company is now leveraging upon. This is a new challenge and an emerging market, so I think my job is to empower employees and push the company forward to become a success in new and exciting eco-friendly business opportunities.","filter_flag":1}

Embracing technological advancements and fostering digital literacy will enhance operational efficiency and market reach. Entrepreneurial education and skill development programs should be bolstered to empower MSME owners and their workforce. Government support in terms of infrastructure development, both physical and digital, will be critical for improving connectivity and facilitating smooth business operations. Encouraging sustainable practices and promoting eco-friendly initiatives will align MSMEs with global trends. Furthermore, creating avenues for MSMEs to integrate into global supply chains and fostering international partnerships will open up new markets and opportunities. Collaboration with large corporations and leveraging e-commerce platforms will also play a vital role. Ultimately, a holistic and inclusive strategy that addresses financial, technological, and socio-economic aspects will contribute to the sustained growth and development of MSMEs, fostering economic resilience and diversity. Here are key aspects of the role of MSMEs in India's economic growth story by 2030: Employment Generation: MSMEs are major contributors to employment generation. They have the potential to create a large number of jobs, particularly in both urban and rural areas. As India works towards inclusive growth, MSMEs can play a pivotal role in reducing unemployment and underemployment. Contributing to GDP: MSMEs significantly contribute to India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By fostering the growth of these enterprises, the overall economic output of the country is boosted. As MSMEs expand, they contribute more substantially to the nation's economic performance. Promoting Innovation: MSMEs are often hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship. They can quickly adapt to changing market trends, introduce new products and services, and contribute to technological advancements. This innovation is vital for staying competitive on a global scale. Entrepreneurship Development: MSMEs provide a platform for aspiring entrepreneurs to enter the business world. They require lower initial investments compared to larger enterprises, making entrepreneurship more accessible. This fosters a culture of self-employment and business ownership. Rural Development: MSMEs have a significant presence in rural areas, contributing to rural development and reducing regional economic disparities. They create opportunities for livelihoods, improve income levels, and contribute to the overall development of rural economies. Diversification of Industries: MSMEs operate in diverse sectors, including manufacturing, services, and agribusiness. This diversification helps in creating a well-rounded and resilient economy. It also reduces dependency on specific industries, making the economy more robust. Export Promotion: MSMEs play a critical role in export promotion. With the right support and incentives, these enterprises can tap into international markets, contribute to foreign exchange earnings, and enhance India's global trade position. Supply Chain Integration: MSMEs often form a crucial part of larger supply chains, especially in manufacturing and services. Their integration into supply chains improves efficiency, reduces costs, and contributes to the overall competitiveness of industries. Financial Inclusion: MSMEs are instrumental in promoting financial inclusion by providing opportunities for small entrepreneurs to access formal credit. Government schemes and initiatives often target MSMEs to ensure they have the financial resources necessary for growth. Sustainable Development: MSMEs have the potential to adopt sustainable and eco-friendly practices. As global awareness of environmental issues increases, MSMEs can contribute to sustainable development by adopting green technologies and practices. Government Initiatives and Support: Government initiatives, policies, and financial support targeted at MSMEs can significantly boost their growth. Schemes related to credit availability, technology adoption, and skill development further enhance the role of MSMEs in the economic landscape. Digital Transformation: Embracing digital technologies can help MSMEs improve efficiency, reach a broader customer base, and compete more effectively. Digital transformation is a key enabler for MSMEs looking to scale and grow in the modern economy. Conclusion for the Growth Path Considering these factors, the sustained growth and development of MSMEs will likely be integral to India's economic growth story in 2030 and beyond. Policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the broader ecosystem must continue to support and nurture the MSME sector to unlock its full potential.","filter_flag":1}
