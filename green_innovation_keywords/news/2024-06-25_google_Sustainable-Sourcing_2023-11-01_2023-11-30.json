Not just any vegetables, but the plants that typically never leave the field. That\u2019s what brothers Jeremy and Adam Kaye, co-founders of The Spare Food Co., New York, envision with the company\u2019s new Spare Starter that made its debut at Fornino in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY, on Nov. 6, kicking off a two-week \u201cWaste Not, Want More\u201d culinary event. The initiative is not about sneaking vegetables into unlikely dishes. Instead, it\u2019s about feeling good about reducing food waste by eating surplus farm produce. \u201cSpare Starter offers a tangible solution toward a sustainable and equitable food system and a proactive way to help achieve the sustainability goals of foodservice operators, their corporate clients and their diners,\u201d said Jeremy Kaye. The Kaye brothers are onto something, as sustainability will continue to grow increasingly popular when making food choices, according to Innova Market Insights, Arnhem, The Netherlands. Sustainability is at the center of Innova\u2019s No. 2 trend for 2024: \u201cnurturing nature.\u201d Seventy percent of consumers said sustainability is more important when choosing a product than two years ago, according to new research from data and analytics solution provider NIQ (formerly NielsenIQ), Chicago. Restaurants that incorporate sustainable sourcing create a point of differentiation when vying for diners\u2019 dollars. \u201cFrom regenerative agriculture to farming conditions for livestock, brands that highlight a bond with nature and the environment are achieving cut-through with consumers,\u201d said Lu Ann Williams, global insight director at Innova. Jeremy Kaye described Spare Starter as a versatile value-added culinary ingredient made with six vegetables and a proprietary spice blend. It includes parts of vegetables, such as leaves and stalks, which are nutritious but more typically trimmed and discarded. The Kaye brothers collaborated with Fornino chef and owner Michael Ayoub to use the item in everything from ravioli filling to burgers (30% vegetables and 70% grass-fed beef). Mr. Ayoub also is using Spare Starter on pizzas that have a crust made with ReGrained SuperGrain+ from Upcycled Foods Inc., Berkeley, Calif. This is an upcycled flour derived from brewer\u2019s spent grain. Also on the special menu is sangria made with The Spare Food Co.\u2019s Spare Tonic, a climate-friendly probiotic sparkling tonic made with upcycled whey. \u201cIt is well documented that around a third of all food that is produced is wasted, and that reducing food waste is shown to be the No. 1 way that we can reverse the effects of climate change,\u201d Jeremy Kaye said. \u201cWhere others see waste, we see overlooked ingredients and untapped goodness. Our mission is to prevent food from being wasted by shifting the collective perspective to making the overlooked essential.\u201d Concern for food waste resonates across all generations, said Amanda Hartt, senior manager, NEXT Data and Insights-New Hope Network, Boulder, Colo. \u201c(Consumers) look to brands that mitigate reducing waste in their supply chain.\u201d Spare Starter not only reduces food waste, but it also saves time in the back of house, especially during foodservice labor shortages. It is shelf-stable until opened, and then requires refrigeration. The vegan ingredient helps to promote a \u201cplant-forward menu that doesn\u2019t compromise on taste,\u201d Jeremy Kaye said.","filter_flag":1}

Unique ALDI Finds provide customers with everything needed to host their own lemonade stands, including a pop-up lemonade stand, various lemonades, a glass beverage dispenser, summer-themed treats and lemon-scented soaps. Also during the campaign, stores offer reusable bags featuring artwork by ALSF heroes and their \u201cSuperSibs,\u201d siblings of kids with cancer. This year, for the first time, ALDI donated 50 cents for each ALSF-branded bag of lemons purchased throughout the month of June, up to $1 million. The grocer intentionally set the price to honor Alexandra \u201cAlex\u201d Scott, the child who started selling lemonade for that amount to raise money to find cures for childhood cancers and inspired the founding of ALSF. Meanwhile, associates raise funds for the ALDI Heroes Fund to pay the expenses of ALSF families traveling for treatment.

PepsiCo's continued investment aims to address some of the most urgent challenges facing agriculture today, while moving the company's pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) agenda forward. The PepsiCo Positive Agriculture Outcomes (PAO) Accelerator will now catalyze more than $30 million in investments to support nearly 40 agricultural projects through 2028. PepsiCo's PAO Accelerator offers local farming communities co-investment to accelerate diverse and results-driven Positive Agriculture projects, as well as funding for ag-tech start-ups that offer proven products or technology with the potential to scale. This year's innovations will build resiliency through climate related analysis, improve soil health, and strengthen farms' climate resilience \u2013 engaging farmers in Australia, Colombia, Egypt, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom.[1] \"We can't motivate systemic change on our own, and our PAO Accelerator continues to provide a forum for farming communities to bring forth ideas and opportunities, and receive the funding needed to get promising innovation off the ground,\" said Margaret Henry, Vice President, Sustainable and Regenerative Agriculture at PepsiCo. \"With this latest round of projects, we're not only fostering this powerful network of innovators across global farmland, but growing closer to achieving a more regenerative future, with farmers' insight at the forefront.\" Among the roster of 2023 projects, will be a project with Australian grain growers to test and validate soil health management practices to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions on-farm. In Colombia, funding will support increasing potato crop quality and yield by installing sprinkler irrigation systems that will also reduce water use. And, in collaboration with 3Keel, a UK-based landscape innovation firm, funding will help connect Europe-based organizations interested in supporting regenerative solutions with local farmland managers who can deliver measurable, sustainable outcomes. \"Investing in pioneering agriculture projects is a key action in combatting the evolving climate crisis and setting farmers around the world, up for long-term success,\" shared Tom Curtis, Director, 3Keel Group Ltd. \"Support from PepsiCo's PAO Accelerator will powerfully enable our team to work with local farmers across Europe to further broker the partnerships needed to accelerate climate action on the ground to strengthen agricultural supply chains for the long-term.\" Since its launch in 2021, the PAO Accelerator has supported diverse projects \u2013 from adopting efficient irrigation systems in response to increased drought, developing kilns to turn agricultural waste into fertilizer, improving soil health, and more. \"Speaking from experience, prioritizing and investing in climate-smart innovation can uncover solutions for our entire global agricultural supply chain,\" said Chris Seymour, Seymour Farms, Canada, and 2022 PAO Accelerator funding recipient. \"With support from PepsiCo's PAO Accelerator, my team gained new insights that helped improved soil health and profitability for my business, even as weather conditions became more unpredictable over time.\" As part of its pep+ transformation, PepsiCo's Positive Agriculture agenda prioritizes investment, innovation, and robust collaboration with our farming partners to deliver impact around the world. The scalable outcomes and ongoing investments in agricultural innovation via PepsiCo's PAO Accelerator continue to support the company's goal to spread the adoption of regenerative farming practices across 7 million acres by 2030, improve the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in its agricultural supply chain, and sustainably source 100% of its key ingredients.

Such is its scope, it claims to supply enough hazelnuts to make 673 million jars of hazelnut spread every year. From ofi\u2019s sourcing and processing operations in Turkey (which accounts for nearly three-quarters of global production) its hazelnuts are exported all over the world as an ingredient in various sweet and savoury products from chocolate and pralines, to spreads and oils. Doing so requires an extensive range of nuts and flavours in customized formats (including natural, blanched, sliced, diced, slivered, roasted, organic, paste and oil) to accommodate modern consumer preferences. The Singapore-based company is therefore confident it is well positioned to capitalise on the \u2018health halo\u2019 enjoyed by nuts among end consumers thanks to high amounts of unsaturated fats, fibre, calcium, iron potassium and protein. Nuts can also support front of pack labelling too. Nutrition-based schemes such as Nutri-Score consider nuts as having a positive impact on the overall nutritional score. There is also an opportunity to use them in savoury snacks in the UK, due to their exemption from the country\u2019s HFSS regulation. Heath and indulgence \u200b Crucially, though, nuts can provide both health and indulgence, and the importance of the hazelnut is linked to chocolate and confectionery, where it dominates the category and is the top flavour for launches in Europe. Ofi is busy unleashing sensory and functional benefits to new or existing products. It sees classic combinations like chocolate and hazelnut evolving to include extra flavour notes, like salt or spice. Think of a bar with hot honey coated hazelnuts, for example. Exciting as this type of innovation is, three quarters of hazelnut production is for the chocolate category, said Swaroop Joshi, ofi Vice President, Sales and Marketing. Categories like ice cream, muesli, protein powder, nut milks are all 'slowly growing' he said \"but today the industry is still dependent on the chocolate confectionary consumption\u200b\u201d. Developing market growth key \u200b The company has observed steady annual hazelnut consumption growth of around 4-5% growth in the last few years. The company is now keen to exploit the enormous growth potential it sees in the chocolate category in developing markets. \"I come from India myself and the first time I saw a hazelnut was when I was in mid 20s,\u201d \u200brevealed Joshi. \u201cI didn't know there was something called a hazelnut which is made into a paste and added to chocolate spread.\u201d\u200b He expects growth in chocolate and hazelnut consumption to accelerate as consumers in developing markets discover a taste for it. Europeans typically eat 6-7 kilos of chocolate a year, he claimed.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Coca-Cola Company disagrees with the actions of the IRS and the latest decision by the U.S. Tax Court. While we disagree with the court\u2019s interpretation of the facts and law in this case, we are pleased to move closer to a final resolution of the Tax Court case so that we can pursue an appeal, where we can assert our claims and vigorously defend the company\u2019s position. This includes our belief that it is unconstitutional to face retroactive tax liability based on the IRS\u2019 use of a calculation methodology that was different from what was long agreed upon and approved in audits for more than a decade. We do not expect the results in this recent supplemental decision to change the methodologies we have used to calculate the tax reserve we have taken or the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability we have disclosed related to the dispute with the IRS or our effective tax rate.
