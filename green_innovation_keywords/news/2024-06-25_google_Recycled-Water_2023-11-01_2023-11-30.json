It is interconnected with everything, and all living things need water to survive. Yet polluted waterways, dwindling access to reserves and declining ocean reefs are putting this vital element in peril. In this episode of Going Green, CNN visits the innovators around the world discovering new ways to protect, preserve and purify the lifeblood of our planet. CNN\u2019s Going Green explores the innovations protecting and purifying water First, CNN visits Cape RADD, an organization in South Africa focused on conserving the Great African Sea Forest and the wildlife that live there. Cape RADD is dedicated to marine research that engages both biologists and citizen scientists. South Africa is one of the top global hotspots for sharks, and one project Cape RADD has embarked upon is studying the shy shark species. With the help of a high-tech shark monitoring database and photographs taken during citizen snorkelling dives, they're aiming to improve protections for these sharks and their habitat. CNN then explores a solar-powered desalination solution created by Elemental Water Makers, which aims to provide clean water in areas that are water-scarce or have limited access to electricity. More than 2 billion people globally do not have access to clean drinking water. After seeing one rural community in Madagascar facing this reality, the Dutch company's CEO Sid Vollebregt and co-founder Reinoud Feenstra were determined to find a solution for water scarcity. Their innovation was built around reverse osmosis - a water purification process that removes contaminants by pushing water through a porous membrane. Vollebregt tells CNN that one machine can create 22,000 liters of water on a single day, drastically improving lives of communities and improving illness rates. CNN then travels to the California, US to visit Epic Cleantec, a startup recycling wastewater into reusable non-potable water. The company seeks to make water use more circular by creating water recycling systems built within buildings themselves, thus eliminating the need to discharge wastewater into a sewer and transport it to a remote treatment facility. Epic Cleantec's CEO Aaron Tartakovsky says their system recycles up to 95% of a building's wastewater for reuse in non-potable applications like toilets and irrigation. They created a beer made from recycled water to show the potential of water reuse, which encourages people to rethink the way they perceive wastewater. Next, CNN visits Glanris, a company converting agricultural waste like rice hulls into a water filtration medium capable of removing contaminants and metals from water, all while sequestering carbon. Glanris was founded in Mississippi, US, right across America's largest rice-producing state, Arkansas, with the mission to take agricultural waste and turn it into biochar. Not only does this conversion process remove carbon dioxide from the normal carbon cycle, biochar can also be used in a variety of products like plastics, water filtration and battery anodes. Biochar's porous nature is also said to improve soil production by increasing water and nutrient retention in the soil. Its potential as a greener, lower cost solution to purifying water has also led Glanris to partner with Clear Genius, a water filter company, to develop a more sustainable filtration medium. Finally, CNN meets Bloom, a sustainable materials company that's turning toxic algae waste into plastics used in consumer products. While algae can be beneficial in many ways, pollution can turn algae into harmful blooms which can deplete oxygen levels, release toxins and kill aquatic life. 'Bloom Sustainable Materials' was thus born out of a desire to help solve this problem by cleaning waterways and creating eco-friendly plastic material out of the collected algae. Bloom's algae-blended products can be made into footwear, sporting gear and other wearables. Bloom says they have cleaned over a billion liters of water and sequestered over a million kilograms of CO2 from the atmosphere in the process.

Their shoes are breathable and stain-resistant and feature an odor-resistant aloe vera-coated liner.

Two styles of sneakers, a Chelsea boot, and a slip-on. Their signature model, the Explorer V2 might easily be one of our favorite eco-friendly athletic shoes. Available in several different colors, the minimalist, versatile design is ready for everyday adventures. It\u2019s durable, lightweight, and waterproof to boot. We\u2019ve recently tested the Explorer V2 and find the waterproof feature super handy, especially for things like commuting and walking the dog on a rainy day. Although we did find the sizing ran a little big in the women\u2019s version (men\u2019s seemed to be fine). 8000Kicks Sustainability Carbon Goals & Achievements | The brand\u2019s manufacturing partners use some renewable energy, and 800Kicks is working with them to increase this amount. Supporting hemp farms and tree planting also helps to capture carbon.

With a breathable TENCEL\u2122 lyocell upper and ZQ-certified wool heel lining, they\u2019re the perfect running shoe for warmer weather. We\u2019ve also previously tested one of Allbirds\u2019 original products, the Wool Runner which will always be an all time favorite for comfort and style. We wore them for years until they literally got holes in the toes so we can vouch for their durability too. We\u2019d also recommend following the washing instructions if you plan to wash your Allbirds in the washing machine.

The discovery comes amid fears that a shift towards electric vehicles would exhaust too much of the world\u2019s supply of lithium\u2014an important component in batteries. Fear about the availability of lithium is only the latest doom and gloom prediction about humanity\u2019s access to resources. Throughout the 20th century, experts predicted that we would run out of food, land, and oil among other things. Consider for example the history of \u201cpeak oil\u201d predictions in the U.S. As the timeline above shows, we\u2019ve been on our last 13 years of oil for 84 years now. Why are predictions about resource availability so biased in the direction of doom and gloom? To see why, we need to turn to one of my favorite economists\u2014Julian Simon. The failure of technical forecasts Over the course of your life, you\u2019ve probably heard that we\u2019re \u201crunning out\u201d of a particular resource. In fact, sometimes experts even boldly make predictions about how we have a specific number of years left before we run out. Where does this information come from? Well, technical forecasts of resource availability rely on two factors: the quantity of a resource available and the rate of consumption. For example, if a community only has 100 gallons of oil, and they use 10 gallons per day in their cars, the oil will only last 10 days. In the late Julian Simon\u2019s book, The Ultimate Resource 2, he highlights that this approach is fundamentally flawed. The problem is that experts don\u2019t have access to either the physical quantity of a resource available or the future rate of consumption for resources. To substitute for this, technical forecasts use the data that are available. The problem is, those data always underestimate the availability of resources. One such data point used to figure out the amount of resources available is known reserves. That is, the amount of a resource that we know exists. The problem with this can be seen by considering incentives. A significant amount of known reserves are discovered by private businesses searching for more of a scarce resource. If you are a lithium mining company with 10 years of supply on hand, there is no need to seek out more. Businesses will only spend to search for new deposits as long as the benefits from discovery are greater than the costs. However, as supplies start to run short, prices for raw materials rise. When the price of a resource rises, the benefits to discovering more of the resource rises. As a result, businesses will begin to search for new reserves when they start to run out. In practice, this means estimates on resource availability will always appear to stay barely ahead of short-term consumption needs. Since businesses only look for more of a resource when the known reserves start to run out, the known reserves will always appear to be running out, even though total reserves (known + unknown) are likely not. Substitutes in everything The other factor, the consumption rate, has a similar problem. As resources become more scarce, prices rise, which forces consumers to economize. For example, when gas is more expensive, people buy less gas. When consumers cut back their consumption of resources like gas they try to find substitute goods. Someone may choose to bike to work or finally spend the time to figure out the public transit paths. Meanwhile, companies try to innovate and create new products which solve consumers\u2019 problems. These innovations often replace the original desire for the increasingly scarce resource. For example, Zoom, in many cases, has replaced the use of gasoline. So as we run out of a particular resource, we should expect consumers will consume less of it. As such, technical forecasts will always assume consumers will over-consume relative to reality. So large discoveries of lithium should be no surprise. As demand increases, I expect the known reserves to continue to increase. And even as lithium reserves do begin to diminish, the profit motive strengthened by increasing prices will drive self-interested businesses to create clever new substitutes. I\u2019ll conclude with Simon\u2019s brilliant illustration of this tendency. \u201cPeople\u2019s response to the long trend of falling raw-material prices often resembles this parody: We look at a tub of water and mark the water level. We assert that the quantity of water in the tub is \u2018finite.\u2019 Then we observe people dipping water out of the tub into buckets and taking them away. Yet when we re-examine the tub, lo and behold the water level is higher (analogous to the price being lower) than before. We believe that no one has reason to put water into the tub (as no one will put oil into an oil well), so we figure that some peculiar accident has occurred, one that is not likely to be repeated. But each time we return, the water level in the tub is higher than before\u2014and water is selling at an ever cheaper price (as oil is). Yet we simply repeat over and over that the quantity of water must be finite and cannot continue to increase, and that\u2019s all there is to it. Would not a prudent person, after a long train of rises in the water level, conclude that perhaps the process may continue\u2014and that it therefore makes sense to seek a reasonable explanation? Would not a sensible person check whether there are inlet pipes to the tub? Or whether someone has developed a process for producing water? Whether people are using less water than before? Whether people are restocking the tub with recycled water? It makes sense to look for the cause of this apparent miracle, rather than clinging to a simpleminded fixed-resources theory and asserting that it cannot continue.\u201d Author Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education","filter_flag":1}

Now is the time to make stacks upon stacks of pocket money\u2014 for you can now recycle your old Fanta cans for 10 cents apiece. By picking up litter, you will become the mogul of recess. On November 1, Victoria\u2019s Container Deposit Scheme, CDS Vic, kicked off. This recycling scheme provides Victorians with a 10-cent refund for each can, carton, and bottle that they return to a collection zone. According to the Victorian Government, this recycling scheme will have a multitude of benefits. Not only will it recycle old containers into new products, but it has also created 600 jobs. One person who\u2019s particularly stoked about this programme is Steve Dimopoulos, Victoria\u2019s Minister for the Environment. \u201cOur new Container Deposit Scheme is now open, which will reduce the amount of litter in Victoria by up to half, contributing to a more sustainable future while putting money back in the pockets of hardworking Victorians,\u201d Dimopoulos said. \u201cCDS Vic will maximise the number of cans, bottles, and cartons being recycled.\u201d As it stands, there are around 400 cash-back sites in Victoria, with 47 Reverse Vending Machines being installed in different Coles locations. According to the Coles General Manager, Grocery Leanne White, these Reverse Vending Machines are going to vastly improve the lives of his patrons. \u201cFrom Bendigo to Blackburn, Berwick and Braybrook, we want to help make recycling as easy as possible for our customers,\u201d White said. \u201cNow Victorian customers can be rewarded for returning their used cans, bottles, and cartons, with the option to put the funds towards their next shop at Coles, redeem for cash, give to a charity, or add it straight into their bank account.\u201d Will Victoria\u2019s Recycling Scheme Work? While NSW, Queensland, and Western Australia all operate similar recycling schemes, some believe that Victoria\u2019s programme will need more support to be viable. One such person is Fatima Madani, an RMIT University Lecturer in Marketing. \u201cTo meet the Victorian Government\u2019s target of diverting 80% of all material away from landfill by 2030, the CDS needs to constantly improve and sustain people\u2019s behaviours,\u201d Madani said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how Victorians engage in the scheme and if they adopt it as a daily life routine and become active participants.\u201d \u201cBusinesses benefiting from the scheme need to practise constant communication, instil convenient processes, and create ongoing connection. These are key pillars which will lead to repeated behaviour, continued engagement, a new recycling mindset, and lifestyle changes.\u201d However, according to Victoria\u2019s Premier, Jacinta Allan, the CDS Vic scheme might already be a state institution. \u201cJust got some great news,\u201d Allan noted. \u201cMore than one million containers were recycled on day one of the Container Deposit Scheme.\u201d Victoria\u2019s Recycling Scheme: All the Refund Locations If you want a map of all the CDS Vic locations, then please click the link here.
