The outcome could affect medication approval, pollution regulation, and more The Supreme Court is set to rule as soon as Wednesday on a seemingly tedious pair of cases that question who should pay for congressionally mandated observers on fishing boats: the owners of the boats or a federal agency. But far from being small fish, the opinions may rejigger the balance of power among the branches of government and weaken the role of science in policymaking. These cases target a long-standing precedent called Chevron deference, which determines how courts evaluate a given federal agency\u2019s interpretation of congressional statutes that guide that agency\u2019s actions. These statutes often contain accidental or intentional ambiguities. And for the past 40 years, agencies have had the leeway to interpret those ambiguities because courts have recognized that these offices are staffed by people with special training and scientific expertise. But legal experts say that Chevron deference will almost certainly change\u2014the only question now is whether the Supreme Court will completely overturn the principle or merely narrow it. And the Court\u2019s decision will ripple far beyond the fishing community. The ruling could affect how medication is approved and what pollutants are regulated; it challenges the authority of a host of agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, where Chevron deference began.

Chevron deference gets its name from a 1984 Supreme Court case that hinged on how the EPA chose to interpret Congress\u2019s Clean Air Act. Under the administration of President Ronald Reagan, the EPA had decided to define the term \u201csource\u201d in a way that would allow a host of new industrial projects to evade pollution emission regulation, says David Doniger, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), who argued\u2014and lost\u2014that case. In its original opinion for the 1984 case, the Court established two principles for evaluating an agency\u2019s actions when it fulfills instructions from Congress. If the relevant statute was clear, the case determined, the agency would have to abide by it. If the statute was ambiguous, a court would have to defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of what it might mean\u2014otherwise the judicial branch would risk overstepping its mandate and entering the realm of policymaking. In the situation Doniger and the NRDC had objected to, the court decided, the Clean Air Act was ambiguous, and the EPA had made a reasonable interpretation. So the agency\u2019s relevant projects were not subject to the regulations. At the time, it was an unremarkable reminder of judicial restraint that had been the norm for a century, Doniger says. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t breaking new ground,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it became a very concise restatement of that approach.\u201d In the decades since the decision, the Chevron opinion has been cited more than 16,000 times in courts across the country. Even Doniger has come to appreciate the policy. A particularly important feature of Chevron deference, he says, is its nonpartisan nature. \u201cIt is a neutral principle,\u201d Doniger says. \u201cIt lets conservative administrations cut back on the scope of these laws, and it lets liberal administrations do more with them.\u201d A Threat to Scientific Expertise Judicial deference to agencies\u2019 expertise is crucial to how U.S. medical and environmental regulation, in particular, currently works. For example, the FDA currently uses its discretion to loosen approval requirements for treatments of rare diseases, such as by permitting historical records to substitute for a control group in a clinical trial, says Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, who has a background in public policy. And the agency\u2019s ability to regulate new products\u2014such as vaping systems and genetic tests marketed directly to consumers\u2014can rely on the ambiguity in terms such as \u201cmedical devices\u201d in legislation from Congress. Ramachandran worries that if Chevron deference falls, the FDA will become more cautious out of fear of being taken to court and losing. \u201cI think the government agencies are just going to be much more hesitant to follow the science and instead might make decisions based on the political and legal landscape,\u201d she says. New treatments might take longer to be approved, and on the other end of the spectrum, people could be exposed to dangerous or misleading products that were able to evade regulation, she worries. Doniger cites the EPA\u2019s regulation of carbon emissions as pollutants and OSHA regulations that targeted the spread of COVID in workplaces early in the pandemic as examples of the sort of situation in which Chevron deference can allow agencies to take the lead on topics that are firmly within their territory but about which Congress has yet to create detailed legislation. Since the development of Chevron deference, Congress and federal agencies have settled into a pattern that works, experts say. Congress writes legislation\u2014which sometimes remains in place for decades\u2014with ambiguities, and the agencies that know the relevant topics better turn that legislation into meaningful and practical policies. \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t have the time or expertise to fill in the details for thousands of regulations, and it\u2019s hard to anticipate the twists and turns of the future and exactly what [lawmakers] need to spell out specifically,\u201d says Dena Adler, a senior attorney at New York University\u2019s Institute for Policy Integrity. Agencies use their expertise to turn broad-brush statutes into nitty-gritty policies, and the courts intervene only in extreme circumstances. Of course, that\u2019s assuming Congress passes legislation in the first place, which is becoming increasingly difficult amid deep partisanship. \u201cSince Congress is so gridlocked, we\u2019re often using existing laws to meet novel challenges,\u201d Adler says. Without Chevron deference, she fears courts may reject agencies\u2019 attempts to fit new issues or technologies into the scope of existing laws. \u201cI think this decision could have real implications for agencies\u2019 ability to tackle the problems of the day like climate change,\u201d she says. The Clean Air Act specifically directed the EPA to incorporate chemicals that would later be determined to be air pollutants, but not all legislation includes this kind of future-proofed language. Blurring the Lines of Agencies\u2019 Authority Chevron precedent isn\u2019t the only source of agencies\u2019 authority, particularly on technical matters. In some situations, legislation does explicitly order a given agency to make certain evaluations, and agencies\u2019 actions in these circumstances should be respected even without Chevron deference, Adler says. And other legal principles exist that support reasonable scientific judgements made by agencies, she notes. But Adler worries these principles may come under fire anyway as small-government advocates seek to blur the lines between such situations and those covered by Chevron deference, which applies exclusively to interpretations of congressional statutes. Regardless of whether Chevron is overturned or weakened, federal agencies will likely face a spike in lawsuits as adversaries feel out the boundaries of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, experts say. Challenges that succeed will force agencies to start fresh on a given issue after federal workers already spent years developing its related rule. Even unsuccessful challenges pull agency resources from other work, says Emily Hammond, a professor of law at the George Washington University. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge distraction, and it\u2019s also years and years of work,\u201d they say. \u201cIt is a big disruption to have a rule overturned.\u201d The less deference agencies expect to have in court\u2014and the more often they expect to end up there\u2014the more limited policies are likely to be, experts agree. Rather than using the full powers of the statutes Congress has written, agencies will likely err on the side of caution. Cultivating hesitancy within federal agencies isn\u2019t necessarily antiscience, but it\u2019s hardly proscience either. \u201cCertainly that weakens the capacity of the government to respond when science reveals a threat to people\u2019s health or people\u2019s lives,\u201d Doniger says. Weakening Chevron deference \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually deny that COVID is transmitted in the workplace or that air pollution is causing cancer or causing climate change; it just makes it much harder for the government to do anything about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes down to whether the government can protect you.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

It was a small container that held diced fruit, the type thrown into lunch boxes. And it was the first product I\u2019d seen born of what\u2019s being touted as a cure for a crisis. Plastic doesn\u2019t break down in nature. If you turned all of what\u2019s been made into cling wrap, it would cover every inch of the globe. It\u2019s piling up, leaching into our water and poisoning our bodies. Scientists say the key to fixing this is to make less of it; the world churns out 430 million metric tons each year. But businesses that rely on plastic production, like fossil fuel and chemical companies, have worked since the 1980s to spin the pollution as a failure of waste management \u2014 one that can be solved with recycling. Industry leaders knew then what we know now: Traditional recycling would barely put a dent in the trash heap. It\u2019s hard to transform flimsy candy wrappers into sandwich bags, or to make containers that once held motor oil clean enough for milk. Now, the industry is heralding nothing short of a miracle: an \u201cadvanced\u201dtype of recycling known as pyrolysis \u2014 \u201cpyro\u201d means fire and \u201clysis\u201d means separation. It uses heat to break plastic all the way down to its molecular building blocks. While old-school, \u201cmechanical\u201d recycling yields plastic that\u2019s degraded or contaminated, this type of \u201cchemical\u201d recycling promises plastic that behaves like it\u2019s new, and could usher in what the industry casts as a green revolution: Not only would it save hard-to-recycle plastics like frozen food wrappers from the dumpster, but it would turn them into new products that can replace the old ones and be chemically recycled again and again. So when three companies used ExxonMobil\u2019s pyrolysis-based technology to successfully conjure up that fruit cup, they announced it to the world. \u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d said Printpack, which turned the plastic into cups. The fruit supplier Pacific Coast Producers called it \u201cthe most important initiative a consumer-packaged goods company can pursue.\u201d \u201cExxonMobil is supporting the circularity of plastics,\u201d the August 2023 news release said, citing a buzzword that implies an infinite loop of using, recycling and reusing. They were so proud, I hoped they would tell me all about how they made the cup, how many of them existed and where I could buy one. Let\u2019s take a closer look at that Printpack press release, which uses convoluted terms to describe the recycled plastic in that fruit cup: \u201c30% ISCC PLUS certified-circular\u201d \u201cmass balance free attribution\u201d It\u2019s easy to conclude the cup was made with 30% recycled plastic \u2014 until you break down the numerical sleight of hand that props up that number. It took interviews with a dozen academics, consultants, environmentalists and engineers to help me do just that. Stick with me as I unravel it all. So began my long \u2014 and, well, circular \u2014 pursuit of the truth at a time when it really matters. This year, nearly all of the world\u2019s countries are hammering out a United Nations treaty to deal with the plastic crisis. As they consider limiting production, the industry is making a hard push to shift the conversation to the wonders of chemical recycling. It\u2019s also buying ads during cable news shows as U.S. states consider laws to limit plastic packaging and lobbying federal agencies to loosen the very definition of what it means to recycle. It\u2019s \u201cvery, very, very, very difficult\u201d to break down plastic that way. It\u2019s been selling governments on chemical recycling, with quite a bit of success. American and European regulatorshave spent tens of millions subsidizing pyrolysis facilities. Half of all U.S. states have eased air pollution rules for the process, which has been found to release carcinogens like benzene and dioxins and give off more greenhouse gases than making plastic from crude oil. Given the high stakes of this moment, I set out to understand exactly what the world is getting out of this recycling technology. For months, I tracked press releases, interviewed experts, tried to buy plastic made via pyrolysis and learned more than I ever wanted to know about the science of recycled molecules. Under all the math and engineering, I found an inconvenient truth: Not much is being recycled at all, nor is pyrolysis capable of curbing the plastic crisis. Not now. Maybe not ever. In traditional recycling, plastic is turned into tiny pellets or flakes, which you can melt again and mold back into recycled plastic products. Even in a real-life scenario, where bottles have labels and a little bit of juice left in them, most of the plastic products that go into the process find new life. The numbers are much lower for pyrolysis. It\u2019s \u201cvery, very, very, very difficult\u201d to break down plastic that way, said Steve Jenkins, vice president of chemicals consulting at Wood Mackenzie, an energy and resources analytics firm. \u201cThe laws of nature and the laws of physics are trying to stop you.\u201d Waste is heated until it turns into oil. Part of that oil is composed of a liquid called naphtha, which is essential for making plastic. There are two ingredients in the naphtha that recyclers want to isolate: propylene and ethylene \u2014 gases that can be turned into solid plastics. To split the naphtha into different chemicals, it\u2019s fed into a machine called a steam cracker. Less than half of what it spits out becomes propylene and ethylene. This means that if a pyrolysis operator started with 100 pounds of plastic waste, it can expect to end up with 15-20 pounds of reusable plastic. Experts told me the process can yield less if the plastic used is dirty or more if the technology is particularly advanced. I reached out to several companies to ask how much new plastic their processes actually yield, and none provided numbers. The American Chemistry Council, the nation\u2019s largest plastic lobby, told me that because so many factors impact a company\u2019s yield, it\u2019s impossible to estimate that number for the entire industry. With mechanical recycling, it\u2019s hard to make plastic that\u2019s 100% recycled; it\u2019s expensive to do, and the process degrades plastic. Recycled pellets are often combined with new pellets to make stuff that\u2019s 25% or 50% recycled, for example. But far less recycled plastic winds up in products made through pyrolysis. That\u2019s because the naphtha created using recycled plastic is contaminated. Manufacturers add all kinds of chemicals to make products bend or keep them from degrading in the sun. Recyclers can overpower them by heavily diluting the recycled naphtha. With what, you ask? Nonrecycled naphtha made from ordinary crude oil! This is the quiet \u2014 and convenient \u2014 part of the industry\u2019s revolutionary pyrolysis method: It relies heavily on extracting fossil fuels. At least 90% of the naphtha used in pyrolysis is fossil fuel naphtha. Only then can it be poured into the steam cracker to separate the chemicals that make plastic. So at the end of the day, nothing that comes out of pyrolysis physically contains more than 10% recycled material (though experts and studies have shown that, in practice, it\u2019s more like 5% or 2%). Ten percent doesn\u2019t look very impressive. Some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability, so companies use a form of accounting called mass balance to inflate the recycled-ness of their products. It\u2019s not unlike offset schemes I\u2019ve uncovered that absolve refineries of their carbon emissions and enable mining companies to kill chimpanzees. Industry-affiliated groups like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification write the rules. (ISCC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.) Legislation in the European Union already forbids free attribution, and leaders are debating whether to allow other forms of mass balance. To see how this works, let\u2019s take a look at what might happen to a batch of recycled naphtha. Let\u2019s say the steam cracker splits the batch into 100 pounds of assorted ingredients. There are many flavors of this kind of accounting. Another version of free attribution would allow the company to take that entire 30-pound batch of \u201c33% recycled\u201d pouches and split them even further: A third of them, 10 pounds, could be labeled 100% recycled \u2014 shifting the value of the full batch onto them \u2014 so long as the remaining 20 pounds aren\u2019t labeled as recycled at all. As long as you avoid double counting, Jenkins told me, you can attribute the full value of recycled naphtha to the products that will make the most money. Companies need that financial incentive to recoup the costs of pyrolysis, he said. But it\u2019s hard to argue that this type of marketing is transparent. Consumers aren\u2019t going to parse through the caveats of a 33% recycled claim or understand how the green technology they\u2019re being sold perpetuates the fossil fuel industry. I posed the critiques to the industry, including environmentalists\u2019 accusations that mass balance is just a fancy way of greenwashing. The American Chemistry Council told me it\u2019s impossible to know whether a particular ethylene molecule comes from pyrolysis naphtha or fossil fuel naphtha; the compounds produced are \u201cfungible\u201d and can be used for multiple products, like making rubber, solvents and paints that would reduce the amount of new fossil fuels needed. Its statement called mass balance a \u201cwell-known methodology\u201d that\u2019s been used by other industries including fair trade coffee, chocolate and renewable energy. Legislation in the European Union already forbids free attribution, and leaders are debating whether to allow other forms of mass balance. U.S. regulation is far behind that, but as the Federal Trade Commission revises its general guidelines for green marketing, the industry is arguing that mass balance is crucial to the future of advanced recycling. \u201cThe science of advanced recycling simply does not support any other approach because the ability to track individual molecules does not readily exist,\u201d said a comment from ExxonMobil. If you think navigating the ins and outs of pyrolysis is hard, try getting your hands on actual plastic made through it. It\u2019s not as easy as going to the grocery store. Those water bottles you might see with 100% recycled claims are almost certainly made through traditional recycling. The biggest giveaway is that the labels don\u2019t contain the asterisks or fine print typical of products made through pyrolysis, like \u201cmass balance,\u201d \u201ccircular\u201d or \u201ccertified.\u201d When I asked about the fruit cup, ExxonMobil directed me to its partners. Printpack didn\u2019t respond to my inquiries. Pacific Coast Producers told me it was \u201cengaged in a small pilot pack of plastic bowls that contain post-consumer content with materials certified\u201d by third parties, and that it \u201chas made no label claims regarding these cups and is evaluating their use.\u201d I pressed the American Chemistry Council for other examples. \u201cChemical recycling is a proven technology that is already manufacturing products, conserving natural resources, and offering the potential to dramatically improve recycling rates,\u201d said Matthew Kastner, a media relations director. His colleague added that much of the plastic made via pyrolysis is \u201cbeing used for food- and medical-grade packaging, oftentimes not branded.\u201d They provided links to products including a Chevron Phillips Chemical announcement about bringing recycled plastic food wrapping to retail stores. \u201cFor competitive reasons,\u201d a Chevron spokesperson declined to discuss brand names, the product\u2019s availability or the amount produced. In another case, a grocery store chain sold chicken wrapped in plastic made by ExxonMobil\u2019s pyrolysis process. The producers told me they were part of a small project that\u2019s now discontinued. In the end, I ran down half a dozen claims about products that came out of pyrolysis; each either existed in limited quantities or had its recycled-ness obscured with mass balance caveats. Then this April, nearly eight months after I\u2019d begun my pursuit, I could barely contain myself when I got my hands on an actual product. I was at a United Nations treaty negotiation in Ottawa, Ontario, and an industry group had set up a nearby showcase. On display was a case of Heinz baked beans, packaged in \u201c39% recycled plastic*.\u201d (The asterisk took me down an online rabbit hole about certification and circularity. Heinz didn\u2019t respond to my questions.) This, too, was part of an old trial. The beans were expired. Pyrolysis is a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d I heard from Neil Tangri, the science and policy director at the environmental justice network Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. He said he\u2019s been hearing pyrolysis claims since the \u201990s but has yet to see proof it works as promised. \u201cIf anyone has cracked the code for a large-scale, efficient and profitable way to turn plastic into plastic,\u201d he said, \u201cevery reporter in the world\u201d would get a tour. If I did get a tour, I wondered, would I even see all of that stubborn, dirty plastic they were supposedly recycling? The industry\u2019s marketing implied we could soon toss sandwich bags and string cheese wrappers into curbside recycling bins, where they would be diverted to pyrolysis plants. But I grew skeptical as I watched a webinar for ExxonMobil\u2019s pyrolysis-based technology, the kind used to make the fruit cup. The company showed photos of plastic packaging and oil field equipment as examples of its starting material but then mentioned something that made me sit up straight: It was using pre-consumer plastic to \u201cgive consistency\u201d to the waste stream. Chemical plants need consistency, so it\u2019s easier to use plastic that hasn\u2019t been gunked up by consumer use, Jenkins explained. But plastic waste that had never been touched by consumers, such as industrial scrap found at the edges of factory molds, could easily be recycled the old-fashioned way. Didn\u2019t that negate the need for this more polluting, less efficient process? I asked ExxonMobil how much post-consumer plastic it was actually using. Catie Tuley, a media relations adviser, said it depends on what\u2019s available. \u201cAt the end of the day, advanced recycling allows us to divert plastic waste from landfills and give new life to plastic waste.\u201d I posed the same question to several other operators. A company in Europe told me it uses \u201cmixed post-consumer, flexible plastic waste\u201d and does not recycle pre-consumer waste. But this spring at an environmental journalism conference, an American Chemistry Council executive confirmed the industry\u2019s preference for clean plastic as he talked about an Atlanta-based company and its pyrolysis process. My colleague Sharon Lerner asked whether it was sourcing curbside-recycled plastic for pyrolysis. If Nexus Circular had a \u201cmagic wand,\u201d it would, he acknowledged, but right now that kind of waste \u201cisn\u2019t good enough.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s got tomatoes in it.\u201d (Nexus later confirmed that most of the plastic it used was pre-consumer and about a third was post-consumer, including motor oil containers sourced from car repair shops and bags dropped off at special recycling centers.) Clean, well-sorted plastic is a valuable commodity. If the chemical recycling industry grows, experts told me, those companies could end up competing with the far more efficient traditional recycling. To spur that growth, the American Chemistry Council is lobbying for mandates that would require more recycled plastic in packaging; it wants to make sure that chemically recycled plastic counts. \u201cThis would create market-driven demand signals,\u201d Kastner told me, and ease the way for large-scale investment in new chemical recycling plants. I asked Jenkins, the energy industry analyst, to play out this scenario on a larger scale. Were all of these projects adding up? Could the industry conceivably make enough propylene and ethylene through pyrolysis to replace much of our demand for new plastic? He looked three years into the future, using his company\u2019s latest figures on global pyrolysis investment, and gave an optimistic assessment.

She\u2019s distraught about the state of the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s very, very, very bad,\u201d she says in ABC\u2019s prime-time Earth Day special, letting out heavy sighs and listing jumbled statistics about deforestation and the hole in the ozone layer. The bartender, Kevin Costner, says he used to be scared, too \u2014 until he started doing something about it. \u201cThese?\u201d he says, holding up a soda can. \u201cI recycle these.\u201d As Streep prepares to launch her beer can into the recycling bin, Costner cautions her, \u201cThis could change your life.\u201d Recycling, once considered the domain of people with \u201clong hair, granny glasses, and tie-dyed Ts,\u201d as the Chicago Tribune described it at the time, was about to go mainstream. The iconic chasing-arrows recycling symbol, invented 20 years earlier, was everywhere in the early 1990s. Its tight spiral of folded arrows seemed to promise that discarded glass bottles and yellowing newspapers had a bright future, where they could be reborn in a cycle that stretched to infinity. As curbside pickup programs spread across the United States, the practice of sorting your trash would become, for many, as routine as brushing your teeth \u2014 an everyday habit that made you feel a little more responsible.

What no one anticipated was just how emotionally attached people would become to recycling as the solution to America\u2019s ugly trash problem. When the chasing arrows\u2019 promise of rebirth was broken, they could get angry. One cold winter day in 1991, people in Holyoke, Massachusetts, chased after garbage trucks, yelling for them to stop, after the drivers had nabbed their sorted glass, cans, and cardboard from the curb. Strained by an influx of holiday-related trash, the city had instructed workers to forgo recycling and just throw everything away. Today, the recycling icon is omnipresent \u2014 found on plastic bottles, cereal boxes, and bins loitering alongside curbs across the country. The chasing arrows, though, are often plastered on products that aren\u2019t recyclable at all, particularly products made of plastic, like dog chew toys and inflatable swim rings. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency said that the symbol\u2019s use on many plastic products was \u201cdeceptive.\u201d Recycling rules can be downright mystifying. For years, people were told pizza boxes were too greasy to be recycled, but now many recycling centers accept them. Some cities accept juice boxes lined with invisible layers of aluminum and plastic; others don\u2019t. And do the screw-on caps stay on plastic bottles or not? Recycling experts ask people to do a \u201clittle bit of homework\u201d to figure out what their local recycling system can handle, but since households have hundreds of items with different packaging to keep track of, that\u2019s asking a lot. The resulting confusion has made a mess of recycling efforts. Plastic wrap tangles around sorting equipment at recycling facilities, shutting down operations as employees try to cut it out of the equipment. Huge bales of paper shipped overseas can contain as much as 30 percent plastic waste. \u201cContamination is one of the biggest challenges facing the recycling industry,\u201d the EPA said in a statement to Grist. It takes time and money to haul, sort through, and dispose of all this unwanted refuse, which makes recycling more of a burden for city budgets. Many cities have ended up cutting costs by working with private waste companies; some don\u2019t even bother trying at all. About a quarter of Americans lack access to any recycling services. The difficulty of recycling plastic can make the chasing-arrows symbol near meaningless, with environmental groups calling plastic recycling a \u201cfalse solution.\u201d Only around 5 percent of plastic waste in the United States gets shredded or melted down so that it can be used again. Much of the rest flows into landfills or gets incinerated, breaking down into tiny particles that can travel for thousands of miles and lodge themselves in your lungs. Plastics threaten \u201cnear-permanent contamination of the natural environment,\u201d according to one study, and pose a global health crisis, with plastic chemicals linked to preterm births, heart attacks, and cancer. So where did the three arrows go wrong? The trouble is that their loop has ensnared us. If some recycling is good, the thinking goes, then more recycling is better. That creates enormous pressure for packaging to be made recyclable and stamped with the arrows \u2014 regardless of whether trying to recycle a glass bottle or plastic yogurt container made much sense in the first place. David Allaway, a senior policy analyst at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, says that the facts just don\u2019t support the recycling symbol\u2019s reputation as a badge of environmental goodness. \u201cThe magnetic, gravitational power of recycling,\u201d he said, has led \u201cpolicymakers and the public to just talk more and more and more about recycling, and less and less and less about anything else.\u201d 1970s First Earth Day Rally April 22 1970 Belmont Plateau Fairmont Park Philadelphia Pennsylvania USA. H. Armstrong Roberts\/ClassicStock\/Getty Images In the spring of 1970, an estimated 20 million Americans \u2014 10 percent of the population \u2014 showed up for the first Earth Day, taking part in rallies, marches, and teach-ins, calling for clean air and clean water. Pollution had pushed its way into the national conversation. The year before, oil-soaked debris had caught fire in the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, sending flames towering five stories high, and a drilling accident in Santa Barbara had spread an oil slick over more than 800 square miles of water. Smog regularly clouded skies from Birmingham, Alabama, to Los Angeles, dimming cities in the middle of the day. The idea of recycling seemingly burst onto the scene in 1970. Earth Day organizers educated people about the value of sorting through their trash and advocated for community recycling programs. People would gather up their bottles and cans in plastic crates and bags and drive to designated sites to drop them off, sometimes earning a few bucks in return. \u201cThe environmental crisis has come into the public consciousness so recently that the word \u2018recycle\u2019 doesn\u2019t even appear in most dictionaries,\u201d the environmentalist Garrett De Bell wrote a couple weeks before the Earth Day event. He pitted recycling as \u201cthe only ecologically sensible long-term solution\u201d for a country \u201cknee-deep in garbage.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before the concept acquired its signature symbol. At the time, Gary Anderson was finishing up his master\u2019s degree in architecture at the University of Southern California. He came across a poster advertising a contest to design a symbol for recycling, sponsored by the Container Corporation of America, a maker of cardboard boxes. Inspired by M.C. Escher\u2019s M\u00f6bius strip, Anderson spent just a couple of days coming up with designs using the now-famous trio of folded, rotating arrows. The simplest of his designs won, and Anderson was awarded a $2,500 scholarship in 1970. The Container Corporation quickly put the logo in the public domain, hoping it would be adopted on all recycled or recyclable products in order to \u201cspread awareness among concerned citizens.\u201d The M\u00f6bius loop he created soon passed from his mind. \u201cI just didn\u2019t really think of the symbol that much,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t used very much in the first couple of years.\u201d One day several years later, however, Anderson was wandering through the streets of Amsterdam in the haze of jet lag when he came across a row of oversized bins emblazoned with a beach ball-sized version of his logo. The Netherlands, purportedly, was the first country to launch a nationwide recycling program in 1972. \u201cIt just really shocked me into a realization that there must be something about this symbol,\u201d he said. Refashioning old materials into new things is a longstanding American tradition. Paul Revere, folk hero of the American Revolution, collected scrap metal and turned it into horseshoes. In the 19th century, used rags were turned into paper, and families stitched together scraps of fabric to create quilts. The desperation of the Great Depression taught people to make underwear out of cotton flour sacks, and the propaganda posters of World War II positioned recycling as a patriotic duty: \u201cPrepare your tin cans for war.\u201d \u201cIt was not in our DNA to be this wasteful,\u201d said Jackie Nu\u00f1ez, the advocacy program manager at the Plastic Pollution Coalition, a communications nonprofit. \u201cWe had to be trained, we had to be marketed to, to be wasteful like this.\u201d One of the first lessons of \u201cthrowaway society\u201d came in the 1920s, when White Castle became the first fast-food restaurant to sell its burgers in single-use bags, advertising them as clean and convenient. \u201cBuy \u2019em by the sack,\u201d the slogan went. In 1935, the big breweries that survived the Prohibition era started shipping beer in lighter, cheaper-to-transport steel cans instead of returnable glass bottles. Coca-Cola and other soda companies eventually followed suit. All those paper sacks and cans soon littered the sides of American roadways, and people started calling on the companies that created the waste to clean it up. Corporations responded by creating the first anti-litter organization, Keep America Beautiful, founded in 1953 by the American Can Company and the Owens-Illinois Glass Company. Keep America Beautiful\u2019s advertisements in the 1960s looked like public service announcements, but they subtly shifted the blame for all the garbage to individuals. Some featured \u201cSusan Spotless,\u201d a girl in a white dress who would wag her finger at anyone who soiled public spaces with their litter. The pressure on American businesses didn\u2019t go away, though. On the Sunday after Earth Day in April 1970, some 1,500 protesters showed up at Coca-Cola\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta to dump hundreds of cans and glass bottles at its entrance. Two years later, Oregon passed the country\u2019s first \u201cbottle bill\u201d requiring a 5-cent deposit on bottles and cans sold in the state, incentivizing people to return them, while Congress was considering banning single-use beverage containers altogether. Manufacturers successfully lobbied against a federal ban, arguing that jobs would be lost, as the historian Bartow J. Elmore recounts in the book Citizen Coke: The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism. But corporations still wanted to relieve the public pressure on them and outsource the costs of dealing with the waste they were creating. Luckily for them, recycling was in vogue. In New York City, the war on waste was spearheaded by the Environmental Action Coalition, an organization raising funds for its \u201cTrash Is Cash\u201d community recycling program, with the long-term goal of getting recyclables picked up by city workers outside homes. Curbside recycling seemed to serve everyone\u2019s interest: Environmentalists wanted to waste less, and companies could use it as an opportunity to shift the cost of dealing with waste onto city governments. Businessmen who volunteered with the Environmental Action Coalition solicited millions in donations from their colleagues in the 1970s, writing that recycling had \u201csubstantial promise\u201d to fend off any legislation to ban or tax single-use containers. The campaign was a deliberate attempt to divert attention from more meaningful solutions like bottle bills, yet environmental groups embraced it, according to Recycling Reconsidered, a 2012 book by Samantha MacBride, who worked in New York City\u2019s sanitation department for two decades. The New York City Council started its mandatory curbside pickup program in the late 1980s, several years after the first one began in Woodbury, New Jersey, requiring residents to set out their paper, metal, glass, and some types of plastic in bins at the curb. The idea picked up in cities across the country, with the number of curbside programs growing from 1,000 to 5,000 between 1988 and 1992, spreading the chasing arrows along with them. A woman recycling in Vermont, US, August 1980. Alfred Gescheidt\/Getty Images \u201cIt was in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s that this thing just becomes everywhere,\u201d said Finis Dunaway, a professor of history at Trent University in Canada. America was running out of places to put its trash, a dilemma captured by the story of a nomadic garbage barge in 1987. In March of that year, a barge teeming with 6 million pounds of trash left Long Island, New York, looking to unload its freight where the landfills weren\u2019t already full. States from North Carolina to Louisiana turned it away, and the barge spent months traveling around the Atlantic coast \u2014 all the way to Mexico, Belize, and the Bahamas \u2014 looking for a place to dispose of the garbage. In October, the barge made its way back to Brooklyn, where a court ordered that its contents be incinerated \u2014 but not before Greenpeace activists hung a giant banner on the boat: \u201cNEXT TIME \u2026 TRY RECYCLING.\u201d Annie Leonard, the former executive director of Greenpeace, told PBS Frontline in 2020 that she wonders whether that banner was a mistake. \u201cI think we were overly optimistic about the potential of recycling,\u201d she said, \u201cand perpetuating that narrative led us astray.\u201d There\u2019s an iconic scene in the 1967 movie The Graduate, in which Dustin Hoffman\u2019s character, Benjamin Braddock, gets cornered at his college graduation party by one of his parents\u2019 friends. \u201cI just want to say one word to you, just one word: plastics,\u201d the older man says. \u201cThere\u2019s a great future in plastics. Think about it.\u201d One generation\u2019s earnest advice for a successful career clashed with a new, skeptical attitude toward plastic, which had already become a byword for \u201cfake.\u201d By the early 1970s, scientists had learned that whales, turtles, and other marine life were getting tangled up in plastic debris, a problem that was killing 40,000 seals a year. They knew, too, that small plastic fragments were making their way into the ocean, and that plastic residues had entered people\u2019s bloodstreams, presenting what an official from President Richard Nixon\u2019s Council of Environmental Quality deemed a significant health threat, \u201cpotentially our next bad one.\u201d The more people learned, the more plastic\u2019s reputation transformed from all-purpose, indestructible wonder into something that maybe shouldn\u2019t be trusted in your new microwave. Between 1988 and 1989, the percentage of Americans who believed plastic was damaging the environment rose from 56 to 72 percent. Larry Thomas, the president of the Society of Plastics Industry, warned in an internal memo that companies were starting to lose business, writing, \u201cWe are approaching a point of no return.\u201d Beverage companies and the oil industry hoped to advertise their way out of the PR problem, laying out plans to spend $50 million a year to tout the polymer\u2019s virtues with slogans like \u201cplastics make it possible.\u201d They also turned to recycling. Lewis Freeman, the former vice president of government affairs at the Society of the Plastics Industry, an industry group, told Grist that he has a vivid memory of a colleague coming into his office, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something to help the recyclers.\u201d Freeman tasked the Plastic Bottle Institute \u2014 made up of oil giants like BP and Exxon, chemical companies, and can manufacturers \u2014 with figuring out how to clarify to recycling sorters what kind of plastic was what. In 1988, they came up with the plastic resin code, the numbering system from 1 to 7 that\u2019s still in place. Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET (1), is used to make soft drink bottles; high-density polyethylene (2) is used for milk jugs; polyvinyl chloride (3) is used for PVC pipes in plumbing, and so on all through 7, the catch-all category for acrylic, polycarbonate, fiberglass, and other plastics. The Plastic Bottle Institute surrounded these numbers with the chasing arrows logo, giving the public the impression that they could throw all kinds of plastics into recycling bins, whether there was infrastructure to process them or not. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Conservation warned that the confusion it would cause \u201cwill have a severe impact on the already marginal economic feasibility of recycling plastics as well as on recycling programs as a whole.\u201d Once the symbol was operational, Freeman said, \u201cthen everybody started putting it on everything.\u201d Companies worked to make it official: Starting in 1989, the Plastic Bottle Institute lobbied for state laws mandating that the code numbers appear on plastic products. Their express purpose was to fend off anti-plastic legislation, according to documents uncovered by the Center for Climate Integrity. The laws eventually passed in 39 states. By the mid-1990s, the campaign to \u201ceducate\u201d the public about plastic recycling had succeeded: Americans had a more favorable opinion of plastic, and efforts to ban or restrict production had died down. But recycling rates \u2014 the share of materials that actually get reprocessed \u2014 had barely improved. Instead, the United States started exporting plastic waste to China, where turning old plastic into new materials helped meet growing demand from manufacturers. Polling conducted for the American Plastics Council in 1997 showed that people who worked in waste management were losing hope that plastics could be recycled, while the public, journalists, and government officials believed they could be recycled at unrealistically high rates. The problem was, fulfilling what companies called the \u201cthe urgent need to recycle\u201d wasn\u2019t as easy as the advertisements made it look. For decades, industry insiders expressed serious doubts that recycling plastic would ever be profitable, with one calling the economic case \u201cvirtually hopeless\u201d in 1969. There are thousands of plastic products, and they all need to be sorted and put through different processes to be turned into something new. The way packaging is molded \u2014 blown, extruded, or stamped \u2014 means that even the same types of plastic can have their own melting points. A PET bottle can\u2019t be recycled with the clear PET packaging that encases berries. A clear PET bottle can\u2019t be recycled with a green one. The plastics that do happen to get sorted and processed can only be \u201cdowncycled,\u201d since melting them degrades their quality. Recycled plastic, it turns out, is more toxic than virgin plastic, liable to leach dangerous chemicals, so it can\u2019t safely be turned into food-grade packaging. It\u2019s also more expensive to produce. The result of this morass is that there is virtually no market for recycled plastics beyond those marked with 1s and 2s; the rest are incinerated or sent to landfills. Only 9 percent of the plastics ever produced have gone on to be recycled. As plastic waste piled up and public frustration mounted, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition \u2014 backed by corporate giants including Procter and Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Exxon Mobil \u2014 launched a bigger, more specific recycling initiative in 2008 called \u201cHow2Recycle.\u201d It came with new labels that appeared to provide clarity about which elements of a product could be recycled, distinguishing between plastic wrap and coated trays, sometimes qualifying the recycling logo with \u201cstore drop-off\u201d labels for plastic bags and film. But environmental advocates say that the How2Recycle labels, used by more than a third of the companies that package consumer goods, may be even more misleading than the resin code. For example, plastic yogurt containers made of polypropylene, number 5s, are considered \u201cwidely recyclable\u201d under the system, yet only 3 percent of all the polypropylene containers produced actually get recycled. The plastic resin code with the chasing arrows certainly confused people \u2014 68 percent of Americans surveyed in 2019 said they thought anything labeled with the code could be recycled. But the How2Recycle labels \u201cput the lies on steroids,\u201d said Jan Dell, the founder of the nonprofit The Last Beach Cleanup. It\u2019s not just a tiny triangular indent on the bottom of a container anymore, but a large, high-contrast recycling logo that \u201cstares you in the face.\u201d Given the dismal state of plastic recycling, it might seem like the best thing to do is throw the chasing arrows in the garbage. But not all recycling is a failure. \u201cMetals are the true success story,\u201d said Carl Zimring, a waste historian at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. As much as three-quarters of all the aluminum that\u2019s ever been produced is still in use, he said. Paper is also relatively easy to process, with more than two-thirds making its way into new products in the U.S. Even for a recycling standby like glass, though, less than a third gets broken down into fragments for new jars and bottles. The recycling logo still gives anything it touches \u2014 whether feasible to recycle or not \u2014 a green aura. Surveys show that a majority of Americans believe recycling is one of the most effective ways they can fight climate change, when experts say it\u2019s unlikely to make much of a difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s a credit to the iconic triangle, which has had 50 years to entrench itself in our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to bash on the image, or bash on corporations, without seeing this as something that is very powerful,\u201d said Dunaway, the environmental historian. So is there a way to give the recycling symbol meaning again? When recycling started taking off in the early 1990s, there was no definitive, agreed-upon definition of what it meant. \u201cAnything is recyclable, at least theoretically,\u201d one lawyer pointed out in a legal journal in 1991. The effort to impose some sort of order came from California, often the national laboratory for environmental protection. The state passed the country\u2019s first restrictions on green claims in 1990, prohibiting advertisers from using terms like \u201cozone-friendly\u201d and \u201crecyclable\u201d on items that didn\u2019t meet its standards (though that stipulation didn\u2019t survive a challenge in court). Wider efforts to restrict the symbol, however, lacked strength and enforcement. In 1992, the Federal Trade Commission told advertisers they could call a product \u201crecyclable\u201d even if only 1 percent of their product was recycled. Not much else happened on that front until 2013, when the group that administers the plastic resin code, ASTM International, announced that it was replacing the chasing arrows with a solid triangle to reduce public confusion. It didn\u2019t require manufacturers to rework their labels, though. A mountain of trash in 2010 in Sausalito, CA, United States. John Lund\/Getty Images Today, that might finally be changing. When China banned the import of most plastics in 2018, it revealed problems that had long remained hidden. The United States had been shipping 70 percent of its plastic waste to China \u2014 1.2 billion pounds in 2017 alone. States set about finding ways to fix the recycling system, with some focusing on the confusion generated by the symbol itself. In 2021, California \u2014 the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy \u2014 passed a \u201ctruth in labeling\u201d law prohibiting the use of the chasing arrows on items that are rarely recycled. To pass the test, 60 percent of Californians need to have access to a processing center that sorts a given material; on top of that, 60 percent of processors have to have access to a facility that will remanufacture the material into something else. Though the bill faced opposition from companies right until it passed, the idea resonated with legislators, said Nick Lapis, the director of advocacy at Californians Against Waste. \u201cIt was pretty easy to understand that putting the chasing arrows symbol on a product that is not ever going to get recycled is not fair to consumers. Like, it just made so much intuitive sense that I think it kind of went beyond the lobbyist politics of Sacramento.\u201d Across the country, public officials in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington state are considering similar legislation. This spring, Maine passed a law to incentivize companies to use accurate recycling labels on their packaging. New rules around the recycling logo are also brewing at the national level. Last April, Jennie Romer, the EPA\u2019s deputy assistant administrator for pollution prevention, called for the FTC to put an end to the \u201cdeceptive\u201d use of the iconic chasing arrows on plastics in its upcoming revisions to the Green Guides for environmental marketing claims. \u201cThere\u2019s a big opportunity for the Federal Trade Commission to make those updates to really set a high bar for what can be marketed as recyclable,\u201d Romer told Grist. \u201cBecause that symbol, or marketing something as recyclable, is very valuable.\u201d Once California\u2019s law goes into effect next year, state laws will clash with each other, since many states still require the resin numbers on plastic packaging. \u201cThe question on everyone\u2019s mind is, who\u2019s going to win out?\u201d said Allaway, the Oregon official. Talk of truth-in-labeling legislation has coincided with another trend \u2014 states trying to turn the costs for dealing with waste back on the manufacturers that produced it. Laws requiring \u201cextended producer responsibility,\u201d or EPR, for packaging have already been approved in Maine, Oregon, California, and Colorado. It\u2019s already led to problems in California, since the EPR bill refers to the state\u2019s truth-in-labeling law to determine which materials can be recycled, creating incentives for everything to be labeled as recyclable, Dell said. Even if the Federal Trade Commission updates the Green Guides to prohibit the deceptive use of the recycling symbol, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the guides are just suggestions. They don\u2019t carry the weight of law. \u201cThe FTC itself has never enforced a false recyclable label, ever, ever, on plastics, not once,\u201d Dell said. One of Dell\u2019s favorite metaphors: \u201cIt\u2019s the wild, wild West of product claims and labeling, with no sheriff in town.\u201d So Dell has appointed herself de facto sheriff, suing companies over their false claims. In 2021, her organization reached a settlement with TerraCycle, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and six other companies that agreed to change labels on their products. Dell recently filed a shareholder proposal with Kraft Heinz in an attempt to force it to remove recyclability claims from marshmallow bags and mac-and-cheese bowls destined for the landfill. Another promising legal push is coming from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who has been investigating fossil fuel and chemical companies for what he called \u201can aggressive campaign to deceive the public, perpetuating a myth that recycling can solve the plastics crisis.\u201d Despite mounting awareness of plastic\u2019s threat to public health, oil and chemical companies around the world make 400 million metric tons of the polymer every year, and production is on track to triple by 2060. It\u2019s the oil industry\u2019s backup business plan in the expectation that wealthy countries will shift away from gasoline in an effort to tackle climate change, since petroleum is the basic building block of plastics. Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer, ranks as the top plastic polymer producer. Stricter enforcement around the use of the chasing arrows could lead to more accurate labels, less public confusion, and better outcomes for recycling centers. But it\u2019s worth asking whether more recycling should even be the goal, rather than solutions that are much better for the environment, like reducing, reusing, refilling, and repairing. As Anderson, the symbol\u2019s inventor, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really fair to blame a graphic symbol for all of our lack of initiative in trying to do better.\u201d This story was originally published by Grist, a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions.","filter_flag":1}

You can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here. Plastic recycling labels are everywhere: The ubiquitous \u201cchasing arrows\u201d symbol adorns everything from plastic bags and water bottles to kids\u2019 toys. Most commonly, these symbols appear with a number \u2014 1 through 7 \u2014 that identifies the type of plastic resin a product is made of. A number 1, for instance, corresponds to polyethylene terephthalate, or PET \u2014 the stuff that makes up water bottles. Number 6 is for polystyrene, used in foam cups and trays. The plastics industry insists these icons were never meant to indicate a product\u2019s recyclability, even though that is how they are often perceived by consumers. In fact, most plastics are not recyclable, largely because there is no market for materials labeled 3 through 7. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the widespread use of the chasing arrows. With no federal program to evaluate products\u2019 recyclability and issue labels for them, third-party organizations have stepped in to play this role instead. One organization in particular, How2Recycle, has devised an elaborate hierarchy with several versions of its own recycling symbol, which it sells to hundreds of companies ranging from Lowe\u2019s to Beyond Meat. The organization, whose parent nonprofit is based in Virginia, says it analyzes waste management systems nationwide to figure out whether companies\u2019 products and packaging are recyclable and then issues a corresponding label. It\u2019s ostensibly an attempt to clear up confusion among consumers about what should and shouldn\u2019t go into the blue bin. The group describes its markers as \u201crecycling labels that make sense.\u201d This summer, How2Recycle declared a big victory for the companies it sells labels to: It now considers a wide set of products made from polypropylene, or PP \u2014 the resin corresponding to the number 5 \u2014 to be \u201cwidely recyclable,\u201d meaning the organization thinks that more than 60 percent of Americans have access to a curbside or drop-off recycling program that accepts them. Polypropylene accounts for about 14 percent of the U.S.\u2019s plastic production. The announcement makes polypropylene tubs, bottles, and jars \u2014 things like yogurt containers and ketchup bottles \u2014 eligible for How2Recycle\u2019s top-tier recycling label: a chasing arrows symbol with no qualifications. But industry experts and environmental advocates have raised their eyebrows. Based on federal recycling data, independent national waste management surveys, and firsthand accounts from material sorting facilities, polypropylene recycling isn\u2019t nearly as widespread as How2Recycle\u2019s labeling implies. Even if PP products were technically accepted by facilities that serve a majority of Americans \u2014 which researchers say they are not \u2014 polypropylene is much more commonly landfilled or incinerated than turned into new products. This is because it is often filled with toxic chemical additives or contaminated with food waste, both of which make it difficult to turn it into new products. It\u2019s usually less economical to sort out polypropylene for recycling than to simply discard it and make new products from virgin material. \u201cPost-consumer PP packaging and products have never been recyclable or recycled \u2026 above a few percent,\u201d said Jan Dell, an independent chemical engineer and founder of the advocacy group The Last Beach Cleanup. Through How2Recycle, she said, plastic and packaging companies are \u201ccreating their own non-verified data\u201d and ignoring key provisions of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Green Guides, a set of requirements meant to prevent companies from making deceptive claims about the environmental benefits of their products. As a result, Dell said, the industry has been allowed to deepen the public\u2019s confusion about recycling, gulling people and policymakers into thinking that it will be able to keep pace with plastic manufacturers\u2019 plans to dramatically scale up production. How2Recycle is part of a labyrinth of organizations and industry membership programs that promote \u201csustainable materials management.\u201d When it officially launched in 2012, the organization branded itself as an attempt to clear up confusion among consumers about what they could recycle. Many companies \u2014 including Yoplait, Costco, REI, and Microsoft \u2014 were quick to sign on, eager to affix How2Recycle\u2019s labels to their products. The program took the onus off of individual companies for claims about recyclability. How2Recycle would do all the necessary research into specific products\u2019 recycling rates and community access to recycling programs, allowing participants to rest assured that their recycling labels were compliant with federal law. Today, more than 400 companies pay annual membership fees to place How2Recycle labels on their packages, including Amazon, Clif Bar, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, and Starbucks. At the top of How2Recycle\u2019s labeling hierarchy is a simple \u201cchasing arrows\u201d recycling symbol, which the organization gives to products that it says are accepted by curbside or drop-off recycling programs that serve at least 60 percent of the American population. This is the label that How2Recycle said in late July some polypropylene products would now be eligible for. Previously, in 2020, the organization had downgraded PP products from the unqualified chasing arrows to a \u201cCheck Locally\u201d label that instructed consumers to verify whether their community\u2019s recycling program would accept them. \u201cAs rigid polypropylene access, sortation, and end markets are on an upward trend across the U.S., we are excited to upgrade this packaging format,\u201d Caroline Cox, How2Recycle\u2019s director, said in a press release this summer. However, other sources paint a very different picture of the United States\u2019 plastic recycling landscape \u2014 especially for polypropylene, which is far more difficult to turn into new products than How2Recycle\u2019s labels make it seem. \u201cIt is not possible that 60 percent of Americans have access to established recycling systems that accept PP packaging of any type,\u201d Dell, of The Last Beach Cleanup, said. First, she explained, industry data suggests that only 60 percent of Americans have access to any recycling program, let alone one that accepts polypropylene containers. Most facilities only accept plastics that are easier to recycle, such as bottles made of PET. And additional data that Dell is compiling for 2022 shows that only half of the country\u2019s 373 material recovery facilities, or MRFs \u2014 specialized plants that process and sort all the items people toss in their blue bins \u2014 say they accept polypropylene tubs, one of the most recyclable PP products out there (think margarine containers and cottage cheese cups). As a result, only 28 percent of Americans have access to recycling programs that accept these polypropylene containers. \u201cOverall accessibility for plastic recycling has dropped, if anything,\u201d said John Hocevar, Greenpeace\u2019s oceans campaign director. In recent years, labor shortages and high prices for recycled materials have caused cuts in curbside recycling programs, and many MRFs have stopped accepting most plastic resins. What\u2019s more, Hocevar and others argue that the accessibility of recycling programs is a distraction from a more important metric: the real recycling rate. Just because polypropylene is collected doesn\u2019t mean it will ultimately be recycled. According to the most recent available data from the Environmental Protection Agency, only 2.7 percent of polypropylene \u201ccontainers and packaging\u201d were recycled in 2018. If you include all forms of polypropylene, that number falls to just 0.6 percent. One reason PP is difficult to recycle is that it\u2019s not as clean or pure as other kinds of plastic. Unlike products made from PET or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) \u2014 labeled with the numbers 1 and 2, respectively \u2014 polypropylene products, labeled with the number 5, often contain toxic additives that make it difficult to turn them back into usable items. Another reason is that PP is typically collected in bales of mixed plastic that include a variety of resins labeled with the numbers 3 through 7. In order to be recycled, PP must be picked out of these bales and then sold to an extremely limited number of facilities that will actually accept that plastic. (\u200b\u200bIn 2020, Greenpeace estimated that the U.S. only had enough processing capacity to recycle less than 5 percent of its PP waste.) The whole process is prohibitively expensive, especially since the final product must be competitively priced against virgin plastics. According to the EPA, the U.S. generated more than 8 million tons of polypropylene waste in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available. Jeff Donlevy, a member of California\u2019s Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling and general manager of Ming\u2019s Recycling, a company based in northern California, said that many facilities continue to accept polypropylene \u2014 even if they have no intention of recycling it \u2014 because of outdated, 10-or-more-year contracts with cities. At the time when many of these contracts were signed, MRFs said they would accept polypropylene because they could send mixed plastic bales to China for sorting and recycling. But in 2018, when China enacted its \u201cNational Sword\u201d policy and closed its borders to most plastic waste imports, U.S. MRFs were saddled with a glut of resins that are uneconomical and logistically difficult to turn into new products. Of the roughly 80 MRFs in California, Donlevy said the vast majority are not recycling plastics made of resins labeled number 3 and above. This includes polypropylene, number 5. Most facilities are \u201cjust landfilling whatever number 5 they get,\u201d he said. How2Recycle says on its website that it takes four factors into account when determining a product\u2019s recyclability \u2014 collection, sortation, reprocessing, and end markets \u2014 but it is not transparent about the exact methodology it uses to evaluate these criteria. Much of its data comes from an industry report conducted by How2Recycle\u2019s parent organization that looks at a \u201cnon-random\u201d sample of large recycling programs throughout the U.S., along with a random sample of recycling programs in smaller communities. In the most recent edition of the report, these censuses consisted of web searches for each recycling program to determine what kinds of plastic they accept. Environmental advocates question the results of these analyses, but they say the larger issue is that How2Recycle fails to say anything about the real recycling rate of PP products. Again, the \u201cwidely recyclable\u201d label is only supposed to reflect a material\u2019s acceptance by curbside and drop-off recycling programs. But this information is not printed on the organization\u2019s unconditional recycling labels. Donlevy said this oversight \u201cmisleads the public.\u201d It may also contravene sustainable packaging guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, a government agency that promotes consumer protection. By slapping recycling labels without qualifiers onto polypropylene tubs and other containers, How2Recycle appears to be ignoring key provisions of the FTC\u2019s Green Guides, a set of detailed but nonbinding requirements for claims about products\u2019 environmental benefits. The U.S. government does not have a program to issue or approve recycling labels, so this is the primary check for labels created by private groups. At the broadest level, the FTC says it is deceptive to \u201cmisrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is recyclable.\u201d This means that companies should not use a recycling label without qualifiers \u2014 like How2Recycle\u2019s gold standard chasing arrows symbol \u2014 unless they can prove that recycling facilities for their labeled products are available to at least 60 percent of consumers. Critically, the commission also calls on companies to substantiate that these facilities \u201cwill actually recycle, not accept and ultimately discard\u201d labeled products. Marketers \u201cshould not assume that consumers or communities have access to a particular recycling program merely because the program will accept a product,\u201d the FTC says in the Green Guides\u2019 statement of basis and purpose. Although the guides aren\u2019t legally binding, activity that is inconsistent with them can be used as evidence of a violation of the FTC Act\u2019s provisions on \u201cUnfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices\u201d and can result in fines or additional rulemaking. State governments can also cite the Green Guides when building false advertising or consumer protection cases. Dell lamented that the FTC has never, to her knowledge, taken action to stop a company from misusing an unqualified recycling label. But courts have. Take, for example, a 2018 lawsuit filed by a consumer against Keurig over claims that the company\u2019s polypropylene coffee pods were \u201crecyclable.\u201d Keurig argued that its labels were consistent with the Green Guides, but a U.S. District Court in California disagreed and refused to dismiss the case. The court said that even if the coffee pods were technically collected by municipal recycling programs, they were not in practice being recycled. Keurig settled the case this year for $10 million and has changed the labels on its coffee pods. Greenpeace argues that How2Recycle is using similar sleight with its own labels, claiming recyclability with insufficient substantiation. \u201cPolypropylene does not come close to meeting the requirements\u201d for recycling labels laid out by the FTC, the organization said in a press release. It is neither accepted at recycling facilities that serve 60 percent of the population nor actually recycled at a significant rate. In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, Paul Nowak \u2014 executive director of How2Recycle\u2019s parent organization, GreenBlue \u2014 said that How2Recycle\u2019s labels not only satisfy the Green Guides\u2019 requirements but \u201cgo beyond them.\u201d Although How2Recycle does not have internal data on the real recycling rate for polypropylene, Nowak said How2Recycle has reviewed \u201cletters of support\u201d from MRFs saying that they plan to expand their recycling capacity for polypropylene. Nowak declined to share these letters with Grist. How2Recycle\u2019s website offers some clarification. Although the organization claims to consider \u201csortation\u201d and \u201creprocessing\u201d for products that will feature its labels, How2Recycle explains online that it ultimately does not take into account the real-world recycling rate when evaluating a product\u2019s recyclability \u2014 in contrast to definitions of recyclability from other organizations, like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an international nonprofit that advocates for a circular economy. Nowak insists that How2Recycle spent \u201cseveral months\u201d verifying data on the increased recyclability of polypropylene. But Dell thinks there\u2019s an irresolvable conflict of interest at play, since How2Recycle and the organizations whose data it cites are run and funded by companies that make and sell plastics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all these front groups funded by the plastics and products industry to create and perpetuate the myth that plastics are recyclable,\u201d she said. The recent push to make polypropylene \u201cwidely recyclable\u201d started outside How2Recycle, with a separate industry group called the Recycling Partnership \u2014 a nonprofit whose board of directors includes executives for major brands and plastic industry groups: Keurig Dr. Pepper, Nestl\u00e9, the Association of Plastic Recyclers, and the American Beverage Association, among others. The organization lists roughly 80 \u201cfunding partners\u201d on its website, including two of North America\u2019s main petrochemical industry trade groups, the American Chemistry Council and the Plastics Industry Association. In 2020, a few months after How2Recycle downgraded PP products to only be eligible for the \u201cCheck Locally\u201d label, the Recycling Partnership launched a new initiative \u2014 directly funded by many plastic brands and industry trade groups \u2014 to \u201censure the long-term viability of polypropylene.\u201d The Recycling Partnership claims it contributed to a spike in polypropylene recycling over the past two years through a series of 24 grants worth $6.7 million. The group did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for more information, but a press release notes that the funding helped \u201csupport sorting improvements and community education across the U.S.\u201d According to the Recycling Partnership, these grants increased the amount of polypropylene recovered by 25 million pounds annually. Now, the group says its proprietary \u201cNational Recycling Database\u201d shows 65 percent of Americans having access to PP recycling. According to Nowak, the Recycling Partnership approached How2Recycle with this data in early 2022, requesting that How2Recycle reevaluate its labeling for polypropylene. After what Nowak described as a lengthy evaluation process, he said the data matched what he was seeing with How2Recycle\u2019s own analysis, as well as information provided by an outside consulting firm. In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, the consulting firm said it provided How2Recycle with access-to-recycling data and \u201cend market\u201d research to show there is a market for polypropylene that ultimately does get recycled. The firm did not share data on polypropylene\u2019s real recycling rate and told Grist to reach out to the Recycling Partnership. How2Recycle, meanwhile, has its own web of connections to big brands and the plastics industry. The group\u2019s parent organization, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, is an industry working group whose members include Procter and Gamble, Coca-Cola, and the ExxonMobil Chemical Company, as well as a host of other plastic makers. GreenBlue, the umbrella organization that houses How2Recycle and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, has a board of directors that includes executives from the Dow Chemical Company, Mars, the packaging companies Printpack and Westrock, and more. Nowak said he is aware of concerns over potential conflicts of interest, but that How2Recycle\u2019s parent organizations are \u201cvery careful about who we start to work with.\u201d At How2Recycle, he added, \u201cwe stay neutral in all that.\u201d Dell has often spoken of the plastic labeling landscape as the \u201cwild, wild West,\u201d with \u201cno sheriff in town\u201d to protect consumers from deceptive recycling claims. The FTC, whose Green Guides may soon be updated for the first time since 2012, declined to comment on How2Recycle\u2019s labeling system, and environmental advocates have expressed frustration that the commission hasn\u2019t done more to enforce the guidelines. Without stronger government regulation, Dell said, \u201cHow2Recycle and the product companies have filled the void to become the deciders\u201d of what should and shouldn\u2019t bear the recycling label. But states are catching on. California passed nation-leading legislation last year making it illegal for companies to use the chasing arrows on products that are not actually being turned into new products. (In this case the state, rather than How2Recycle, will determine recyclability, and it will take into account both collection and the real recycling rate.) The law is expected to eliminate recycling symbols on virtually all plastic packaging that isn\u2019t made of number 1 or number 2 resins, since those are the only kinds of plastic currently being recycled with significant regularity. It could have an impact on other states, too \u2014 if plastic manufacturers decide it is too cumbersome to create new product lines for the California market, they could decide to remove recycling symbols for the whole country. Hocevar of Greenpeace said the California bill is an important step in the right direction and called on other states to adopt similar policies. Environmental advocates have also cheered a separate effort from the California attorney general\u2019s office, which announced in April that it was launching an investigation into the petrochemical industry\u2019s \u201caggressive campaign to deceive the public\u201d about the feasibility of recycling. To truly address the plastic pollution crisis, Hocevar and others say that the top priority should be turning off the tap \u2014 limiting the production of plastic that ultimately has to be dealt with. In the U.S., perhaps the most promising move in this direction is the proposed Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, a far-reaching federal bill that would ban carryout plastic bags and other single-use plastic products, require plastics companies to launch and finance programs to manage the waste they produce, and place a moratorium on new petrochemical facilities until the EPA can undertake a comprehensive assessment of the industry\u2019s environmental impact. In the meantime, Donlevy said that companies should stop trying to trick consumers into feeling good about their plastic consumption. \u201cProducers have to realize they\u2019re using plastic for their benefit and for the consumers\u2019 benefit, which is fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to put a recycling symbol and say that that cottage cheese or cream cheese or sour cream container is recyclable? You don\u2019t need to do that, that\u2019s not a part of the sales pitch. \u2026 The only plastics that are really getting recycled in the U.S. are number 1 and number 2 bottles.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

In other words, in a perfect world, everyone would choose to support the best ESG stocks to buy. However, in a paradigm of limited resources, some things have to go. Usually, that something is anything related to moral directives. However, the concept that doing right must necessarily come at the expense of the bottom line might need a rethink. That may have been the case in a more cynical time. But these days, the emerging consumer cares deeply about sustainability and other holistic endeavors. Indeed, fostering a reputation for not prioritizing sustainability and other morally desirable attributes can hurt the bottom line. Plus, multiple organizations have started to call attention to the top performers in the ESG circuit. Earning these awards can lead to additional eyeballs. With that in mind, below are potentially the best ESG stocks to buy. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: VDB Photos \/ Shutterstock.com Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is no stranger to innovation and overall business prowess. However, it would be remiss to have a discussion of the best ESG stocks to buy and not include MSFT. According to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the software (and hardware) juggernaut took the top spot in the publication\u2019s 100 Best ESG Companies for 2023. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if took the checkered flag in first again for 2024. Microsoft offers so many initiatives covering sustainability and other holistic efforts targeting broader wellness and equity that it\u2019s difficult to cover in any single article. For me, one of the most impressive ambitions that the company forwarded is its aim to be carbon negative \u2013 not just neutral \u2013 by 2030. By that, we\u2019re talking about being profitable or accretive for the environment, rather than merely mitigating the damage done. Beyond that, the company has been killing it financially. In the past four quarters, its average earnings surprise has come out to 7%. Fiscal 2024 earnings per share may hit $11.79 on sales of $244.92 billion. That would be up 20.2% and 15.6%, respectively, from last year. Mastercard (MA) Source: David Cardinez \/ Shutterstock.com One of the biggest financial services firms in the world, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is well known for its credit solutions. It also happens to be ranked among the best ESG stocks to buy. In particular, the company has a focus on empowerment. First, it fosters an ecosystem of diversity and opportunity, enabling individuals to reach their top potential. Second, Mastercard is attempting to merge the power of technology and the social need for equity together. Specifically, it wants everyone to participate in the digital economy, and is thus focused on connecting individuals to tools and resources that will enable them to reach prosperity. Finally, the credit services specialist is accelerating its efforts to promote a low carbon, regenerative economy. Notably, these initiatives are not coming at the expense of financial performance. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average EPS hit $3.12. This translated to an earnings surprise of 3.35%. Analysts see EPS in fiscal 2024 reach $14.32 on sales of $27.85 billion. That would come out to 16.8% and 11% up, respectively, against the prior year. Caterpillar (CAT) Source: Shutterstock On the surface, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) might not immediately sound like one of the best ESG stocks to buy. As an industrial equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar plays a pivotal role in resource mining and energy projects. While these are no doubt important roles, such operations aren\u2019t exactly holistically helpful for the environment. Still, CAT is actually one of IBD\u2019s top ESG plays, ranked number six last year. While mining and manufacturing operations lead to a broader impact, Caterpillar is also engaged in helping to minimize carbon emissions. As well, the company is supporting its enterprise-level customers through new products, technologies and services to help facilitate reduced emissions. Plus, some of the resources that Caterpillar indirectly helps extract \u2013 like lithium \u2013 can potentially yield positive results through the ultimate end product (i.e. electric vehicles). Even better, the financials don\u2019t appear to have suffered from its ESG efforts. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average earnings surprise reached 3.35%. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $14.32 on sales of $27.85 billion, up 16.8% and 11%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Bunge (BG) Source: JHVEPhoto\/ShutterStock.com Based in Chesterfield, Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) plays a key role in the global food supply chain. In terms of industry, it falls under the farm products sector. Per its public profile, Bunge operates as an agribusiness, providing vital commodities such as oilseeds, grains (comprising of wheat and corn) and products for animal feed manufacturers. Because the company depends such much on a healthy environment, it\u2019s no surprise that BG ranks among the best ESG stocks to buy. According to its website, one of the Bunge\u2019s initiatives involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unlocking opportunities for sustainable growth. It also launched a program to help accelerate regenerative agriculture. If ever the criticism comes that \u201cdo-gooder\u201d organizations can\u2019t succeed financially, Bunge will prove doubters wrong. In the past four quarters, its average EPS clocked in at $3.36. During this period, the average earnings surprise soared to 27.55%. That\u2019s wildly impressive. Admittedly, analysts anticipate a slowdown in fiscal 2024. However, the high-side revenue target of $62.38 billion may represent a nearly 5% growth rate from last year. Either way, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy. Mondelez (MDLZ) Source: Shutterstock A confectionary giant, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) has delighted generations of consumers. It also happens to be one of the best ESG stocks to buy for its wide-ranging initiatives. According to its website, Mondelez has achieved a 100% success rate in implementing over the past four years food safety schemes that were benchmarked by the Global Food Safety Initiative. As well, 48% of the electricity used in its manufacturing sites have been sourced from renewables. That\u2019s a sizable improvement over the 40% usage metric seen in 2022. So, Mondelez isn\u2019t just talking the talk, it\u2019s walking the walk. In addition, the company has stressed its social equity initiatives, fostering an environment of diversity and inclusion. In the past four quarters, Mondelez posted an average EPS of over 84 cents. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 7.08%. Therefore, even with such a strong focus on ESG directives, the financial print remains robust. For fiscal 2024, analysts are anticipating EPS may reach $3.50 on sales of $36.84 billion, up 9.7% and 2.3%, respectively, on a year over year basis. Marriott (MAR) Source: Tricky_Shark \/ Shutterstock.com A multinational organization, Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) operates, franchises and licenses lodging brands. Primarily, the enterprise focuses on hotels, though it\u2019s also involved in residential and timeshare properties. Presently, its portfolio covers over 30 hotel and timeshare brands at 8,785 locations. With the sustained interest in traveling and similar experiential expenditures, MAR could swing higher. Just as well, the company is succeeding under a framework of holistic positivity. By 2025, Marriott aims to have 80% of managed hotels participating in community service activities. In addition, it\u2019s putting money into the mix to develop hospitality skills and opportunities among youth, diverse populations, women, people with disabilities and veterans and refugees. With such a strong commitment to improving society\u2019s bottom line, some might wonder about Marriott\u2019s own financials. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 in the past four quarters, it posted EPS of nearly $2.52. This translated to an earnings surprise of 17.8%. For fiscal 2024, covering experts do see a possible dip in EPS. However, they\u2019re also targeting revenue of $25.45 billion, up 7.3% YOY. Additionally, their blue-sky sales target for that year stands at $26.21 billion. Thus, MAR could rank among the best ESG stocks to buy. Clean Harbors (CLH) Source: Shutterstock A provider of environmental and industrial services, Clean Harbors (NYSE:CLH) makes an organic case for the best ESG stocks to buy. Part of its business involves the always critical hazardous waste disposal solution for companies, small waste generators and government agencies. Through its expansionary efforts, Clean Harbors features approximately 400 service locations in North America. These include over 50 hazardous waste management facilities. As the company states on its website, its business is sustainability. When circumstances go wrong, Clean Harbors is effectively a first responder for the environment and for overall social wellness. Thus, part of the bullish narrative for CLH stock centers on its natural monopoly. While other enterprises can compete with Clean Harbors, the barriers \u2013 including regulations \u2013 are quite steep. Financially, the company enjoyed a solid outing over the past four quarters except for Q3 2024. That turned out to be a sizable miss. Still, the average earnings surprise during the aforementioned period landed at 0.45%. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate 7% growth in EPS to hit $7.48. Also, sales could rise 9% to reach $5.89 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the best ESG stocks to buy.

For those interested in learning how Enviri is creating value both for the environment and shareholders, please join us for the half-day event. Enviri\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Nick Grasberger, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Vadaketh, will provide an update on Enviri and the Company\u2019s financial priorities and outlook. The event will also feature the accomplishments and outlook for Clean Earth as well as its unique business attributes and key initiatives. Jeff Beswick, Senior Vice President & Group President of Clean Earth, will engage in discussions on these and other topics through a series of presentations and a Q&A session, along with Clean Earth\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Elizabeth Peterson and Chief Financial Officer Michael Polcovich. \u201cIt has been a number of years since our last Analyst Day, since which Enviri has gone through a major business transformation,\u201d said Mr. Grasberger. \u201cToday, we are a leading environmental solutions company with strong market positions around the world. The majority of our revenues are recurring, and we expect to benefit from sustainability goals of our customers and evolving environmental regulation. These facts when combined with internal improvement initiatives have made Enviri into a less cyclical company with attractive growth potential today.\u201d \u201cIn addition, our underlying businesses are performing well and our shorter- and longer-term outlook for each is positive. As a result, we\u2019re targeting annual cash earnings growth of 10+ percent over the next few years. This along with significant deleveraging in the year ahead is expected to drive meaningful value creation for our shareholders.\u201d Financial Targets During the Analyst Day, the Enviri management team will discuss how the business is poised to deliver attractive revenue and cash earnings growth. Further, the team will discuss how this growth will drive increased free cash flow and balance sheet deleveraging. More specifically, the Company will introduce 3-Year financial targets which include the following: Mid-single digit organic revenue growth on average over next 3 years Average adjusted EBITDA growth of 10 to 12 percent annually during this period Adjusted EBITDA targets of 17 percent for Clean Earth, 20 percent for Harsco Environmental and 10 percent for Harsco Rail Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin of 10 percent for Enviri\u2019s business segments Credit Agreement Net Leverage Ratio of 2.5x at the end of 2027 Webcast and Registration A live webcast of the Analyst Day presentations and supporting materials will be accessible on the Investor Relations section of the Company\u2019s website, www.enviri.com.
