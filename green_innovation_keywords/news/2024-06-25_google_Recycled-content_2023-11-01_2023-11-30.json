Recycling can benefit your community, the economy, and the environment. Products should only be recycled if they cannot be reduced or reused. EPA promotes the waste management hierarchy, which ranks various waste management strategies from most to least environmentally preferred. The hierarchy prioritizes source reduction and the reuse of waste materials over recycling. On this page: Benefits of Recycling Environment Recycling provides many benefits to our environment. By recycling our materials, we create a healthier planet for ourselves and future generations. Conserve natural resources: Recycling reduces the need to extract resources such as timber, water, and minerals for new products. Climate change: According to the most recent EPA data, the recycling and composting of municipal solid waste (MSW or trash) saved over 193 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018. Energy savings: Recycling conserves energy. For example, recycling just 10 plastic bottles saves enough energy to power a laptop for more than 25 hours. To estimate how much energy you can save by recycling certain products, EPA developed the individual Waste Reduction Model (iWARM). Waste and pollution reduction: Recycling diverts waste away from landfills and incinerators, which reduces the harmful effects of pollution and emissions. Economy EPA released significant findings on the economic benefits of the recycling industry with an update to the national Recycling Economic Information (REI) Study in 2020. This study analyzes the numbers of jobs, wages and tax revenues attributed to recycling. The study found that in a single year, recycling and reuse activities in the United States accounted for: 681,000 jobs, $37.8 billion in wages, and $5.5 billion in tax revenues. This equates to 1.17 jobs per 1,000 tons of materials recycled and $65.23 in wages and $9.42 in tax revenue for every ton of materials recycled. For more information, check out the full report. Community Environmental Justice: Across the country, waste management facilities are concentrated in underserved communities, and they can have negative impacts on human health, property values, aesthetic and recreation values, and land productivity. Recycling provides these areas with a healthier and more sustainable alternative. International: Waste generated in the United States also affects communities in other countries. Recycled materials are exported to some countries that are not able to manage those materials in an environmentally sound manner. U.S. Recycling System Overview The recycling process is made up of three steps that are repeated over and over again. This creates a continuous loop which is represented by the familiar chasing arrows recycling symbol. The three steps of the recycling process are described below. Step 1: Collection and Processing Businesses and consumers generate recyclables that are then collected by either a private hauler or government entity. There are several methods for collecting recyclables, including curbside collection, drop-off centers, and deposit or refund programs. Visit How do I recycle... Common Recyclables for information on specific materials. After collection, recyclables are sent to a recovery facility to be sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing. Recyclables are bought and sold just like raw materials would be, and prices go up and down depending on supply and demand in the United States and around the world. Step 2: Manufacturing After processing, recyclables are made into new products at a recycling plant or similar facility. More and more of today's products are being manufactured with recycled content. Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in asphalt to pave roads or recovered plastic in carpeting and park benches. Step 3: Purchasing New Products Made from Recycled Materials You help close the recycling loop by buying new products made from recycled materials. There are thousands of products that contain recycled content. When you go shopping, look for the following: Products that can be easily recycled Products that contain recycled content Below are some of the terms used: Recycled-content product - The product was manufactured with recycled materials either collected from a recycling program or from waste recovered during the normal manufacturing process. The label will sometimes include how much of the content came from recycled materials. Post-consumer content - Very similar to recycled content, but the material comes only from recyclables collected from consumers or businesses through a recycling program. Recyclable product - Products that can be collected, processed, and manufactured into new products after they have been used. These products do not necessarily contain recycled materials. Remember not all kinds of recyclables may be collected in your community, so be sure to check with your local recycling program before you buy. Some common products you can find that are made with recycled content include the following: Aluminum cans Car bumpers Carpeting Cereal boxes Comic books Egg cartons Glass containers Laundry detergent bottles Motor oil Nails Newspapers Paper towels Steel products Trash bags Challenges to Recycling System While the benefits of recycling are clear, the current system still faces many challenges. Many people are confused about what items can be recycled, where they can be recycled and how. This often leads to recyclables going in the trash or trash going in the recycling bin. America\u2019s recycling infrastructure has not kept pace with today\u2019s waste stream. Communication between the manufacturers of new materials and products and the recycling industry needs to be improved to prepare for and optimally manage the recycling of new materials. Domestic markets for recycled materials need to be strengthened in the United States. Historically, some of the recycled materials generated in the U.S. have been exported internationally. However, changing international policies have limited the export of materials. Improving communication among the different sectors of the recycling system is needed to strengthen the development of existing materials markets and to develop new innovative markets. We need to better integrate recycled materials and end-of-life management into product and packaging designs. More consistent measurement methodologies are necessary to improve recycling system performance. These more standardized metrics can then be used to create effective goals and track progress. What is Being Done? The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law: Transforming U.S. Recycling and Waste Management: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a historic investment in the health, equity, and resilience of American communities. With unprecedented funding to support state and local waste management infrastructure and recycling programs, EPA will improve health and safety and help establish and increase recycling programs nationwide. National Recycling Strategy: EPA developed the National Recycling Strategy with a focus on advancing the national municipal solid waste recycling system. It identifies strategic objectives and actions to create a stronger, more resilient, and cost-effective recycling system. Draft Strategy to Prevent Plastics Pollution: This strategy builds upon EPA\u2019s National Recycling Strategy and focuses on actions to reduce, reuse, collect, and capture plastic waste. America Recycles Day: Every year on November 15, EPA reminds everyone of the importance and impact of recycling through education and outreach. Basel Convention: The United States is a signatory to the Basel Convention, but has not yet become a Party to the Convention. The Basel Convention establishes standards for the transboundary movement of various types of waste.","filter_flag":1}

It\u2019s one of the most common items in roadside litter. Plastic bottles and containers end up in our lakes and rivers, and plastic refuse mars our parks and public spaces. Moreover, the fossil fuels that go into making these products contribute to climate change. New regulations from the Washington Department of Ecology will help to address some of those problems by increasing the amount of plastic that gets recycled and reused to make new plastic packaging. Companies that sell drinks, milk, wine, trash bags, personal care products, and household cleaners must include more recycled plastic in their packaging, according to the new rule. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look very hard to see that we have a plastic problem \u2013 plastic containers are among the most common items we find in roadside litter,\u201d said Ecology Director Laura Watson. \u201cThis rule will help us reduce pollution, increase the value of our recycling, and make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to keep Washington beautiful and litter-free.\u201d Since January, companies that make trash bags and beverage containers have been required to make their products with at least 10% and 15% recycled content, respectively. The requirements gradually increase over the next 12 years, and expand to include plastic packaging for other common products. By 2036, most plastic packaging will be required to contain at least 50% recycled content. A graph showing the increase in recycled material in plastic containers over the next 12 years. Every year, companies must comply with the requirements, report, and pay fees based on the weight of plastic they sell into the state. Increasing recycled content in plastics is the latest step in implementing a 2021 law passed by the Washington Legislature, aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics. The law banned single-use plastic bags as well as foam packing peanuts and takeout containers. It also restricted the use of throw-away plastic takeout items at restaurants and lodging establishments and set new standards for recycled plastic content. \u201cPlastic pollution is ugly, harmful, and expensive to clean up,\u201d said Peter Lyon, manager of Ecology\u2019s Solid Waste Management program. \u201cUsing recycled plastic to make new products is the sustainable thing to do, and it cuts down on harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Credit: Connect world via Shutterstock. The national environmental ministers of Australia have agreed to develop new packaging standards to expedite the country\u2019s transition towards a circular economy. As part of this, the country will set nationwide minimum recycled content requirements and forbid the use of harmful chemicals in domestic packaging. A government press release said: \u201cThis will make decisions at the checkout much easier for shoppers, who won\u2019t have to spend precious time comparing the environmental credentials of different products.\u201d Under these national packaging laws, businesses in the country will be held accountable for the 6.7 million tonnes of packaging they are claimed to collectively dispose of into the Australian market. Ministers also called for a national traceability framework, which they believe will improve customers\u2019 confidence in the use of recycled materials when purchasing recycled products. The framework is crucial in driving the reuse of recovered plastics, glass, and other materials into new products, the government claimed. Australian Food and Grocery Council, in a statement, added: \u201cAny increase in the use of recycled content relies on sufficient collection and processing of that material here in Australia. \u201cMandatory design standards are essential for a circular economy, but importantly require a recycling system to process the material Australians collect at home. \u201cTraceability of recycling material will provide confidence for Australians to recycle, brands the confidence to procure recycled content and the broader supply chain the confidence to invest in recycling infrastructure, creating local jobs.\u201d The states of Western Australia, Queensland, and South Australia already have a ban in place for a range of single-use plastic items.

Each European produces 190 kilograms of packaging waste yearly, something the new law aimed to reverse with a renewed push on recycling and new targets on reuse and waste prevention. However, lawmakers voted to weaken some of these measures, including on reuse and bans for unnecessary packaging, following political division and intense lobbying. In the end, the Parliament\u2019s stance on the law was passed with 426 votes in favour, 125 against and 74 abstentions, after \u201ca very difficult vote\u201d, according to Nils Torvalds, a Finnish centrist MEP who is one of the lead lawmakers on the file. With the Parliament\u2019s position now adopted, negotiations can start with EU member states to finalise the law in so-called trilogue talks also involving the European Commission. Reuse and bans weakened The Parliament\u2019s position includes reducing unnecessary packaging by 5% by 2030, 10% by 2035 and 15% by 2040. There are also specific measures to reduce plastic packaging, including a ban on very lightweight plastic carrier bags (unless required for hygiene or preventing food waste) and heavy restrictions on single-use formats like miniature hotel toiletries. Overall, lawmakers want to cut the amount of plastic packaging in Europe by 10% by 2030, 15% by 2035 and 20% by 2040. However, measures to reduce packaging waste such as bans on unnecessary packaging, were removed, making environmental organisations question how waste reduction targets will be achieved. Reuse targets were also watered down, with a new provision allowing EU countries to get out of 2030 reuse targets for a specific packaging type if they have a recycling rate of over 85% for that material. Lead EU lawmaker cuts takeaway reuse targets from draft packaging waste law Targets to boost the reuse of packaging in the restaurant sector have been deleted by the European Parliament lawmaker in charge of negotiating a new law on packaging waste, according to a set of amendments seen by EURACTIV. This drew the ire of NGOs and left-wing lawmakers who criticised the European Parliament\u2019s stance as a missed opportunity to boost reuse and pointed the finger at lawmakers for bowing to pressure from industry. \u201cWe cannot recycle our way out of this mess,\u201d said Green lawmaker Grace O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cIf your single-use plastic cup is recycled into a single-use plastic bag, it is not sustainable. If your plastic junk is swapped for cardboard junk, it is not sustainable. And if we continue to generate levels of waste at current rates, that is, by definition, unsustainable,\u201d she added. The agreed text reads like the \u201cpackaging lobby\u2019s Christmas wish list,\u201d said German lawmaker Delara Burkhardt, who was fighting for strong reuse provisions on behalf of the Parliament\u2019s socialist group. \u201cWe could have made reusable packaging the norm across Europe, banned unnecessary single-use packaging like disposable cups in fast-food restaurants or individual plastic packaging for fruits and vegetables, and set guidelines against excessive air in shipping packages,\u201d the German MEP said. \u201cThe European Parliament has missed a significant opportunity to address the growing waste heaps in the EU,\u201d she added. Similarly, Zero Waste Europe, an environmental pressure group, criticised the removal of bans for disposable plates and cups from dine-in restaurants and single-use packaging for fruit and vegetables. \u201cGranting derogations and exemptions on waste prevention and reuse to \u2018appease\u2019 industry players is unacceptable and takes us even further from the ultimate goal of this revision: reducing packaging waste,\u201d said Aline Maigret, head of policy at the NGO. Conservatives satisfied Meanwhile, centre-right and conservative lawmakers welcomed the Parliament vote as a shift away from the \u201cover-regulation and micro-management\u201d contained in the draft proposal by the European Commission. \u201cA ban on packaging alone will not reduce waste,\u201d said Massimiliano Salini, the lead lawmaker on the file for the centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). \u201cWe need innovative, fully renewable and recycled packaging formats. These should not be banned,\u201d he added, saying he was happy that bans on certain packaging formats were abandoned. \u201cOur first concern is food safety and health, where single-use packaging plays a key role in our everyday lives. While aiming for reuse, we must be aware of packaging\u2019s life cycle. One cannot generalise, single-use can still be the best environmental solution in certain circumstances,\u201d Salini said. Italian lawmakers weigh on EU's green packaging law ahead of key vote Lawmakers in the European Parliament\u2019s environment committee will vote on their approach to new rules tackling packaging waste on Tuesday (24 October) amid warnings from environmental groups that the law risks being watered down due to a concerted pushback from Italian MEPs. Industry groups were also largely happy with the result. UNESDA, representing the European soft drinks sector, commended \u201cpositive efforts\u201d by the European Parliament to create a circular economy. \u201cWe very much appreciate MEPs\u2019 efforts in promoting circularity of beverage packaging by enabling closed-loop recycling, mandating the setting-up of Deposit and Return Systems (DRS) and acknowledging the complementarity of reuse and recycling as well as the role of systems enabling refill,\u201d said Nicholas Hodac, director general of UNESDA. Industry groups also welcomed the Parliament\u2019s bigger focus on improving waste collection, which is a precondition to improve recycling. \u201cWe welcome the adoption of a mandatory collection target for packaging \u2013 an indispensable condition for effective recycling,\u201d said Annick Carpentier, director general at the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment (ACE). \u201cOverall, ACE is pleased to see that the definition of high-quality recycling remains linked with the quality of recycled materials and their potential to substitute primary raw materials,\u201d she added. On the other hand, the plastics industry was not happy, criticising arbitrary bans and watered targets for recycled content to be incorporated into new products. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the decision by the environment committee to reduce the recycled content targets for contact-sensitive packaging has not been reversed in Plenary,\u201d said Virginia Janssens, managing director at Plastics Europe, a trade association. This is a missed opportunity to use the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation to boost the development of the market for recycled plastic packaging in Europe,\u201d she added. Definition of 'high-quality' recycling takes centre stage in EU packaging law The European Union wants to reduce waste by encouraging recycling and reuse in its new packaging law, but the pressure is on to get the right definition and criteria for what constitutes \u201chigh-quality\u201d recycling.

The suit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, is one of the first legal challenges from a state against a major plastic producer. It draws on a 2022 investigation from James\u2019 office in which PepsiCo-branded plastic packaging was found to be by far the most significant contributor to plastic waste clogging the Buffalo River and its tributaries. Out of nearly 2,000 pieces of plastic trash collected at 13 sites along the waterways, PepsiCo products \u2014 which include brands like Aquafina, Cheetos, Gatorade, and Lay\u2019s \u2014 accounted for more than 17 percent of those with identifiable branding. All that plastic litter is breaking down into tiny fragments \u2014 microplastics \u2014 that are winding up in Buffalo\u2019s water supply and the fish that people eat. Some of the chemicals contained in microplastics are carcinogenic, and researchers have raised concerns that the particles could cause reproductive dysfunction and other maladies. \u201cPepsiCo\u2019s irresponsible packaging and marketing endanger Buffalo\u2019s water supply, environment, and public health,\u201d James said in a statement. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The New York lawsuit includes a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d claim and requests that the state\u2019s Supreme Court require PepsiCo to reduce the amount of plastic packaging entering the Buffalo River and remediate pollution that has already occurred. It also invokes consumer protection law: Although PepsiCo has \u201clong been aware\u201d of the environmental and human health risks posed by single-use plastic products, the AG\u2019s office says PepsiCo has obscured these risks in communications to the public \u2014 in part by promoting plastics recycling and the promise of a so-called \u201ccircular economy,\u201d in which plastic products can be endlessly reprocessed rather than eventually turned into waste. New York Attorney General Letitia James Spencer Platt \/ Getty Images One PepsiCo communication cited in the lawsuit says the company\u2019s plastic recycling strategy will \u201ckeep the material in the circular economy.\u201d Most plastics \u2014 including all of PepsiCo\u2019s snack food wrappers \u2014 cannot be recycled, and even the company\u2019s plastic soda bottles can only be turned into a new bottles a few times before they have to be junked. Nationally, only 5 percent of plastics are ever turned into new products. Meanwhile, PepsiCo has repeatedly missed or failed to make progress toward its own targets for plastic reduction and the use of recycled content. Most recently, the company reported an 11 percent increase in virgin plastic use between 2020 and 2022, despite a commitment to reduce virgin plastic by 20 percent by 2030. Between 2018 and 2022, it also reported a decrease in the fraction of its plastic packaging that was reusable, recyclable, or compostable. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, PepsiCo said it is \u201cserious about plastic reduction and effective recycling.\u201d \u201dThis is a complex issue and requires involvement from a variety of stakeholders, including businesses, municipalities, waste-reduction providers, community leaders, and consumers,\u201d a spokesperson said via email. According to a national waste audit coordinated by the nonprofit Break Free From Plastic Pollution, PepsiCo has been among the top three companies creating the most pieces of plastic litter every year since 2018. Only the Coca-Cola Company has consistently produced more plastic litter. Environmental nonprofits have repeatedly sued PepsiCo and other companies over their use of plastic and claims about recyclability, but these suits have been less common at the state level. Last year, Connecticut\u2019s attorney general filed a truth-in-advertising lawsuit against Reynolds Consumer Products, arguing that the company labeled its Hefty trash bags as recyclable \u201cdespite full knowledge that their bags were incompatible with recycling facilities in Connecticut.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s attorney general filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year, targeting both the Hefty manufacturer and Walmart. Volunteers pick up trash along the Buffalo River in upstate New York. Courtesy of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper Those suits, however, did not invoke public nuisance law \u2014 something that makes the PepsiCo case \u201cnew and very exciting,\u201d according to Bethany Davis Noll, executive director of the State Energy and Environment Impact Center at the NYU School of Law. She could think of only one other ongoing public nuisance lawsuit related to plastic pollution, filed in 2020 by the nonprofit Earth Island Institute against companies including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Public nuisance has played a more prominent role in recent lawsuits filed by attorneys general against manufacturers of PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d which have tainted drinking water supplies worldwide. The New York lawsuit seeks to require PepsiCo to attach a warning label to any single-use plastic products sold in the Buffalo region, conveying plastics\u2019 risks to public health and the environment. It also seeks civil penalties, restitution, and disgorgement of any profits it made through sales in the Buffalo region that were found to have been illegal under New York state\u2019s consumer protection laws. Rachel Karasik, a senior policy associate at the Duke University Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability, said a successful case could spur PepsiCo to invest in reuse systems throughout the Buffalo area. In the absence of a New York state-wide extended producer responsibility law for plastic packaging \u2014 a policy that makes plastic producers financially responsible for the waste they produce \u2014 Karasik also said litigation could yield financing for plastic cleanup and collection activities. Noll hoped the New York attorney general\u2019s case would inspire more legal challenges elsewhere. Plastic pollution is \u201cprevalent all around the country,\u201d she told Grist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get companies to stop lying about how this stuff is recyclable.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Recycled content resin will further reduce EPS' environmental impacts with even lower energy use, and a smaller carbon footprint. Post this Recycled content EPS has been technically achievable for some time, but historically end users have not been motivated to use it. That trend is changing. With more stringent policy recommendations stemming from national governments, there is mounting pressure for the private sector to take a second look at recycled content capabilities. EPS resin producers are prepared to meet recycled content mandates and extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation. This commitment to the development of sustainable solutions reinforces environmentally responsible EPS production, and positions them well to comply with future regulations. \"In response to the surging global demand for recycled content resins, we've witnessed remarkable technological innovations across various industries. Notably, the green building sector has embraced using recycled content resin for insulation, offering an eco-conscious solution without sacrificing quality. With a promising growth forecast, recycled content resins are making a substantial impact on sustainability worldwide,\" said David Wilson, Purchasing Manager at RAPAC. \"This new product offering has the potential to be a game-changer for the EPS industry\", said Betsy Bowers, Executive Director of the EPS Industry Alliance (EPS-IA), the North American trade association leading the expanded polystyrene (EPS) industry. \"Recycled content resin will further reduce EPS' environmental impacts with even lower energy use, and a smaller carbon footprint. Despite long standing misconceptions, EPS recycling has a strong track record that will now see even more growth.\" In March 2022 at the UN Environment Assembly, a historic resolution was adopted to develop an international legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, which could have a global impact on many of the day-to-day products used by consumers and manufacturers.

With more than five million bales successfully wrapped in high-performance bale wrap made of recycled content since then, Trioworld now displays a full assortment of premium products for baled silage with recycled content at Agritechnica 2023. Bale wrap of the future \u201cWe believe that this is the bale wrap of the future\u201d, says Anders Larsson, Product manager Agricultural stretch films at Trioworld. \u201cThe performance is just as we want it. Silage quality and wrapping performance have proven to be on equal level as with our premium products without PCR. The fact that five million bales have been successfully wrapped with our bale wrap containing recycled material is just additional proof that it really does work\u201d, he continues. What started with the 25 \u00b5m bale wrap film has in the last years grown to a full assortment of PCR based products. The Trioworld PCR bale wrap assortment is based on post-consumer recycled material and certified by RecyClass** and has been used and evaluated by farmers and contractors all around the world. Many years of research and development together with field tests have made it possible for Trioworld to be the first producer to offer options with recycled content for all their premium products for baled silage. What makes this so unique is, that this also includes the more efficient high-tech products with reduced thicknesses of 21 or 19 \u00b5m as well as net replacement films. Closing the loop in bale wrap What makes Trioworld\u2019s recycled bale wrap extra exceptional is that it is produced from used bale wrap that is collected and recycled into new high-performance PCR film. Trioworld operates three recycling plants in Europe and produces high-performance regranulates from the collected, used bale wrap in their own process, which ensures stable quality and performance. It is a rare and high-tech process to recycle used products into the same level of performance in new products. This solution to recycle used bale wrap into new bale wrap does not only encourage the collection after use but also enables a true circularity which decreases the climate impact significantly. Depending on the product it is now possible to reduce the carbon footprint by up to 43%*** when switching to an alternative with less material usage and post-consumer recycled content. \u201cWe are very happy that customers have understood the value of this new way of making silage more sustainable and are looking forward to achieving the goal of having 30% PCR in all our products by 2025\u201d, states Anders Larsson.
