Emerging end-user technologies continue to change the facilities management and cleaning landscape and the way owners and operators approach new ways to maintain and clean facilities. From Class A buildings to hospitals, schools, and retail establishments, there are several technologies now available that are redefining processes for the better. Autonomous Cleaning Equipment When initially introduced to the market, autonomous cleaning equipment didn\u2019t gain much traction among end users for the simple fact they were either perceived as too expensive, not effective, or not needed. But with market conditions and labor shortages continuing to plague many industries, facility managers are giving these technologies a closer look. Specifically in the healthcare industry, we have seen an uptick in the utilization and demand for robotic cleaning technology as the labor force continues to be squeezed even tighter. The equipment, designed primarily for floor and carpet cleaning, allows cleaning crews to set and forget them, freeing up valuable time for cleaning teams to focus on other areas. In the post-COVID era, we are seeing manufacturers rolling out improvements in the technology and upgrades to software. The dashboards in the applications display every square inch of flooring cleaned so custodial managers know exactly what has been cleaned and how much time it took. Where we have implemented these autonomous cleaning systems, building managers and operators have noticed that the floors and carpets are cleaner because the machines are hitting 100 percent of what is expected and needed every day. From a cost perspective, we\u2019re seeing more organizations realize that these machines are indeed a capital investment, but with a true and measurable return on their investment. Within 12 to 18 months, organizations are seeing returns. These machines typically last six or more years with continual software upgrades that keep them relevant and viable for the long term. UV Technology Continues to Make Waves Ultraviolet (UV) technology has been around for some time, but its popularity, especially in healthcare settings, has continued to rise for its effectiveness at disinfection. New UV devices are smaller, smarter, more effective, and less expensive as we\u2019re seeing more hospitals implementing the technology for complete room sanitation. UV technology ensures the rooms are thoroughly disinfected, eliminating viruses and infectious materials. And, as they have become smaller, we\u2019re seeing hospitals use multiple devices in each room to overcome the challenge of shadowing, issues where surfaces are shadowed from UV light in the room which renders the technology less effective. The newer UV technology also includes dashboards, which provide users with data on which rooms have been disinfected and for how long. Touchless Remains a Gold Standard Touchless technology continues to be a gold standard in restroom cleanliness. Fixtures such as hands-free toilet flushers, automatic soap and sanitizer dispensers, automatic faucets, and touchless paper towel dispensers have become mainstream in restrooms across all types of facilities from Class A buildings to schools and airports. Touchless fixtures help minimize the need for around-the-clock sanitation of traditional restroom hot spots, eliminate the overuse of products by consumers, and save on human resources with fewer visits necessary to restock dispensers. IoT Technology Integration IoT technology enables the integration of various smart devices, sensors, and systems, which can enhance efficiency, productivity, safety, and cost-effectiveness. For example, people counters are an emerging technology that facilities are using in restrooms to help cleaning teams be more efficient. Sensors on touchless dispensers alert facilities teams when soap or paper towel dispensers need to be refilled. Tying IoT technology into workloading software applications is becoming another powerful tool managers have in their arsenal. In our data-driven environment, workloading software is proving to be a highly effective way to not only automate scheduling and improve productivity and resource management but also provide enhanced analytics. Workloading software delivers critical data that managers need to improve efficiency and overall facility performance, including response times, completion rates, and resource utilization. While there is growing interest in this technology and the integration with workloading applications, some software packages are still cost-prohibitive. But like with any new technology, manufacturers will find ways to lower costs and make this technology more available. When this happens, I see IoT and workforce integration exploding in places such as airports, large arenas, and stadiums. How and When to Introduce New Technologies Owners, operators, and facility managers may feel overwhelmed with the new technologies coming online and how to effectively implement them in their buildings. At ACME, we work with clients to schedule a thorough site evaluation to best determine their needs. We look at the big picture to understand the pain points, consumer and tenant feedback, and overall productivity to make recommendations for new products and devices that will positively benefit operations and the bottom line. Everyone needs a clean building. The demand is not going away, especially as a reduced labor force continues to be a facilities challenge. What will change as the demand for smart technology continues to rise is the availability and affordability of emerging technologies, which will only benefit the facility management industry as we move into the future.

That\u2019s where digital twins come into play\u2014they\u2019re like a supercharged tool that can tackle these aspects head-on. Around 50% of the time, digital twinning is primarily employed to enhance operational performance and manage quality control. Additionally, it is utilized for systems planning, which accounts for approximately 44% of its application. In Layman\u2019s language\u2026 A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. The object being studied\u2014for example, a wind turbine\u2014is outfitted with various sensors related to vital areas of functionality. These sensors produce data about different aspects of the physical object\u2019s performance, such as energy output, temperature, weather conditions, and more. This data is then relayed to a processing system and applied to the digital copy. Once informed with such data, the virtual model can be used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate possible improvements, all to generate valuable insights\u2014which can then be applied back to the original physical object. In recent years, the concept of digital twins has gained significant attention across various industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. In this article, we will delve into the benefits of using digital twins and explore how they are transforming industries worldwide. But first, let\u2019s understand the concept of digital twins. Also Read: WiMi Hologram Cloud is Developing A Digital Twin-based Human-Robot Collaboration System What are Digital Twins? Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects, processes, or systems that simulate their behavior and characteristics in real-time. They serve as digital counterparts, capturing data from sensors and devices embedded in their physical counterparts, allowing for monitoring, analysis, and optimization. These digital replicas enable us to gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and drive innovation across various industries. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins have gained significant traction. According to Gartner, by 2023, it is estimated that there will be over 30 b****** connected devices globally, providing a wealth of data for digital twins to leverage. This exponential growth presents immense opportunities for industries to harness the power of digital twins. Benefits of Digitial Twins In manufacturing, they facilitate product design optimization, allowing engineers to simulate different scenarios and test various configurations virtually. This reduces the need for physical prototypes, saving time and costs. They enable predictive maintenance, where anomalies in asset performance can be detected and addressed proactively. According to a study by Deloitte, predictive maintenance driven by digital twins can reduce maintenance costs by up to 40% and increase equipment uptime by up to 20%. In smart cities, digital twins enable urban planners to simulate and optimize infrastructure projects, traffic flows, and energy usage. This helps in improving sustainability and resource efficiency. Siemens reported that by leveraging digital twins, Dubai reduced energy consumption by 20% and water consumption by 30%. Enhanced Design and Simulation Capabilities Digital twins o**** a remarkable advantage by providing engineers and designers with an advanced platform for designing and simulating products, processes, and systems. By creating a virtual replica of a physical entity, they enable testing and optimization of various scenarios before the actual implementation takes place. This capability has a significant impact on design efficiency, leading to improved product performance and functionality. A study by PTC reveals that companies that utilize digital twins in their design processes can reduce overall development time by up to 20%. This time-saving is achieved by minimizing the need for physical prototyping and streamlining design iterations within the virtual environment. Through the identification and resolution of potential issues within the digital twin, engineers can proactively make necessary adjustments in the early stages of the design phase. This proactive approach effectively minimizes the need for costly rework during the production process.

This freedom to experiment results in breakthrough solutions and fosters a culture of innovation within organizations. Lenley Hensarling, Chief Product Officer, Aerospike, explains how massive amounts of data about environments, devices, and experiences over time drive the evolution of models. \u201cThese models can be for specific pieces of machinery, but they may also be for a more holistic view of the machinery in a process within an environment. This implies retaining not just data from the instrumentation of the equipment but also data in the environment \u2014 and of the other equipment that may be involved. Devices interact with each other. New advances in data management and the availability of vast amounts of storage in the cloud have opened up new opportunities for more complex and higher fidelity models, not just about a given piece of equipment, but about the environment, the processes the equipment is involved in, and how the equipment interacts with other systems.\u201d Enhanced Efficiency and Sustainability in Transportation A November 2022 report by the world road transport body IRU revealed that there could be two million unfilled driving positions in Europe by 2026 (already now there are around half a million unfilled positions in Europe, including about 60.000 in the UK). Adding a mere 18 minutes of driving time can eradicate the capacity crunch \u2013 according to scientists at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. This claim was based on research in the US but pointed out that the same principle is likely to apply in Europe.\u201d Also Read: The Impact of Salesforce on the Advancement of AI in Marketing and Sales To understand how digital twins were aiding sustainability, we got in touch with Jaspreet Singh, Senior Product Manager, Trimble MAPS. She explained how Trimble utilized digital twins in the transport sector to enhance efficiency and accuracy in operations. \u201cDigital Twins will help provide more accurate ETAs to fleets, allowing them to have enhanced efficiency in their operations. The enhanced and accurate ETA will allow for better load planning for future loads. The goal is to provide an efficient workflow to back office individuals. Today, our understanding is that fleet\/driver manager spend a tremendous amount of time digging through loads and trucks in order to understand the ones that require their attention due to exceptions (ETA, unplanned stops, weather). Digital twin technology will improve their efficiency by alerting on the ones that need attention.\u201d While discussing how digital twins have contributed to reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability in the transportation industry, she says, \u201cProviding optimized routes \/ mileage calculation will ensure the least number of miles, which obviously has a positive environmental impact. Since the digital twin is taking into account live GPS pings of the truck, it will alert on situations where the driver is going off route and adding unnecessary miles. This allows the ability to bring the driver back on track asap.\u201d Transporeon, a Trimble company, uses digital twins in its Carbon Visibility \u2013 a tool for accurate and transparent measurement, reporting, reducing, and benchmarking greenhouse gas emissions from transport. \u201cIn particular, the tool uses the digital twin technology for calculating GHG emissions based on primary data for a \u2018shipper-carrier-corridor\u2019 combination, even if the carrier does not share primary data with that shipper. This method involves taking data directly from a truck and including each truck, each route, as well as such driving data as acceleration and braking data.\u201d Serge Schamschula, Head of Ecosystem for Transporeon, a Trimble Company, further added, \u201cUsing digital twins, Transporeon also develops algorithms that predict fuel consumption and consequent CO2 emissions.
