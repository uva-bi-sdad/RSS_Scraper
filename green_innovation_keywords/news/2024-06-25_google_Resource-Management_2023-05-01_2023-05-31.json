The Northwest and Rocky Mountain Regional Food Business Center, which Oregon State will lead with Colorado State University, will serve Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. It is one of 12 new USDA centers nationally that are part of a $400 million initiative that focuses on small and mid-sized farm and food businesses within local and regional food systems. The centers will focus on historically underinvested and underserved communities in their region. \u201cThis is important recognition of the work we have been doing to build a strong local food economy in Oregon, in collaboration with farmers, food businesses, grassroots organizations, and many other partners around our state,\u201d said Lauren Gwin, interim director of OSU\u2019s Center for Small Farms & Community Food Systems in the College of Agricultural Sciences and OSU Extension community food systems specialist. \u201cWe are excited to take this work to another level, here at home and across the West.\u201d The Northwest and Rocky Mountain Regional Food Business Center will focus on four areas that are priorities for the six-state region: Strengthening local supply chains for animal proteins. This work will support small- and mid-scale meat and poultry businesses by expanding the Western Meat School, led by the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network, a national program within OSU\u2019s Center for Small Farms & Community Food Systems. Participants learn about producing, financing, processing, marketing and pricing niche meat products. Rebecca Thistlethwaite, NMPAN Director, will co-lead this area. Connecting and scaling food entrepreneurs. Guidance and resources from government agencies and institutions are key for business development, but often don\u2019t align with the needs of small- and mid-sized enterprises. The work will facilitate connections among entrepreneurs and disseminate information about resources and programs that could aid those looking to scale their businesses. Sarah Masoni of Oregon State\u2019s Food Innovation Center will co-lead this area. Supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Scientific research is focused on developing climate resilient grants and other crops, but information about how to process and market those products is lacking. This work will expand processing infrastructure, develop new products, help create supply chain contracts and implement marketing strategies using those climate-resilient crops. \u201cRight-sizing\u201d investment and infrastructure. This work includes improving two-way understanding and communication between food producers, processors, and distributors and investors, banks, and other sources of capital that potentially can provide funding. The investment and infrastructure work is particularly crucial to supply chain infrastructure and systems, which must be the appropriate scale for producers, products and markets to thrive The Northwest and Rocky Mountain Regional Food Business Center will be supported by a regional steering committee with staff from OSU and Colorado State, teams from each of the six states and four priority areas, and community leaders from underserved and underinvested communities engaged at all levels in the center.","filter_flag":1}

The legislation, introduced by Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and sponsored by several other Senate Republicans, exempts owners\/operators of composting operations and solid waste management facilities from liability under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, commonly known as the \u201cSuperfund\u201d law. Specifically, they\u2019d be protected from liability with respect to environmental contamination from perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are a class of long-lasting chemicals found in consumer, commercial and industrial products that present human toxicity and environmental contamination concerns. The chemicals can be added in the manufacturing of products, or PFAS can result as an unintended byproduct of manufacturing. Under CERCLA, owners of contaminated sites, as well as individuals and organizations that shipped the contaminated material to those sites in the first place, can be sued and forced to help contribute to cleanups under certain circumstances. The law has recently been applied to force electronics recycling companies to contribute to the cleanup of stockpiles of old, bulky TVs containing leaded glass, for example. What would change Lummis\u2019 bill says that resource management facilities \u2013 essentially defined by federal law to include composters, recycling and garbage facilities \u2013 can\u2019t be forced to help pay for environmental cleanup if they received and managed solid waste or biosolids that contained PFAS. An exemption is if the resource management facilities acted \u201cwith gross negligence or willful misconduct in the discharge, disposal, management, processing, conveyance, or storage\u201d or PFAS substances. The legislation, which hasn\u2019t been assigned a bill number yet, is just one of five bills Lummis has introduced that exempt different industries from CERCLA liability for PFAS. The introduction comes as the U.S. EPA is considering designating some PFAS compounds as hazardous substances under CERCLA. \u201cThere is no doubt we need to consider the environmental impacts of PFAS chemicals but suing entities who did not contribute to the contamination is overkill, especially considering some of these entities, such as ranches and water facilities, are just downstream receivers,\u201d Lummis stated in a press release. The National Waste & Recycling Association (NWRA), Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA), US Composting Council, Waste Management (WM) others voiced support for the bill. States such as California, New York, Oregon and others are beginning to target the use of PFAS in new products. Private recycling industry stakeholders, including the How2Recycle labeling program and the U.S. Plastics Pact, have also taken steps against the use of intentionally added PFAS.

Ricardo waste expert, Steve Brown, explores these challenges in this blog. In 2020, waste management accounted for 4% of UK\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Despite its relatively low contribution when compared to other sectors, such as agriculture and transport, the emissions associated with waste management are playing a significant role in the UK\u2019s journey to net zero. The sector has already achieved an emissions reduction of 73% since 1990, mainly due to actions taken to reduce landfilling, and has strong links with other industries, such as energy and transport. Waste management companies have seen an increase in market and policy-related pressures in the recent years. Following the Paris Agreement and the 2019 Climate Change Act, the Environmental Services Association (ESA), the industry body for the waste and recycling sector, commissioned Ricardo to establish the baseline greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the sector and set out a pathway to reach net zero by 2040. The publication of the ESA Net Zero Strategy in June 2021 resulted in most large companies in the sector committing to achieve net zero status by 2040. The market is moving forward with local authorities declaring climate emergencies and the publication of the Procurement Policy Note (PPN) 06\/21, which requires organisations procuring goods and\/or services with an anticipated contract value above \u00a35 million per annum to have a published Carbon Reduction Plan. This plan, amongst other requirements, details the organisation\u2019s GHG emissions and confirms its commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. These developments have made GHG emissions a key criteria in procurement. Ricardo\u2019s experience working on decarbonisation projects with waste and recycling organisations has brought to surface some of the challenges the sector faces when attempting to quantify their emissions. Avoided emissions Avoided emissions arise when an activity leads to emissions not being released that would otherwise have occurred. In the case of the waste and recycling sector, materials that are diverted for reuse or recycling can offset the need to make new products from virgin materials, and so can be assigned a credit for the emissions avoided by not making those new products. For example, the generation of electricity in an Energy from Waste facility avoids the need for generation of electricity from other sources, such as coal and natural gas. Similarly, the recycling of aluminium avoids the need to extract and process aluminium ore. The sector contributes to avoided emissions across the supply chains of other industries, to such an extent, that, were avoided emissions included in (i.e., deducted from) the sector\u2019s carbon footprint, the GHG emissions balance would have a negative value. This significant benefit, which the sector cannot claim credits for, has been the subject of debate as the lack of framework on accounting of GHG emissions can discourage companies from fully utilising materials and energy as in many cases that results in an increase of their scope 1 and 2 emissions leaving them further away from their net zero targets. Data collection and reporting When it comes to GHG emissions reporting, waste management companies face two challenges. First, they must collect data which may not be readily available or disaggregated enough to allocate it to specific processes. Secondly, the most frequently used emission factors related to recycling are published as one aggregated value per material, which does not allow reporting in scopes. Consequently, a recycling firm who wishes to exclude a part of the factor which is already accounted for in their footprint is bound to some degree of double counting. Local authorities need to estimate the emissions associated with their waste management contracts. However, due to the information agreements with their contractors, detailed data, such as fuel and electricity consumption and the destinations of collected waste, may not be allowed to be shared. Consequently, the assessment of the total emissions associated with the collection and treatment of waste, from the point of generation at households and businesses to final fate, is usually incomplete. Address these challenges The challenge on avoided emissions requires agreement across the sector on the approach to be followed. As a next step, pressure could be applied to the government to explore how a framework on the accounting of avoided emissions could be developed, to incorporate avoided emissions in the GHG emissions reporting standards. As far as data is concerned, Ricardo can help businesses identify the data required for the assessments and undertake life cycle assessments to break down emissions factors. Moreover, data collected from the various databases available can be used to fill in any data gaps. Support for the waste sector Ricardo has completed many carbon footprints for the operations of waste management companies, usually accompanied with mitigation measures to achieve net zero emissions, procurement exercises (which included GHG emissions in the evaluation criteria) for both bidders and local authorities, and GHG emissions assessments for councils and their waste management contracts and strategies. The outcomes of these projects helped our clients to: Keep up with their competition Understand the concept of GHG emissions and how they associate with them Understand their current position Start thinking about their next steps to reduce emissions Our long experience working with the waste sector means we can help organisations overcome challenges associated with carbon accounting through our technical expertise, bespoke tools and breadth of capabilities.

In short, Elon Musk teased two new EVs which he predicts could sell more than 5 million units per year combined. The Tesla CEO was coy on details about the two unnamed EVs, as he would prefer a \u201cproper dedicated product launch\u201d. Musk said: \u201cI just want to emphasize that we are actually building a new product, we are actually designing a new product\u201d, adding that \u201cThere are two new products that I think you will be very excited about\u201d. More: Could This Be Our First Look Of The Updated Tesla Model 3? The Tesla CEO made some bold claims, saying that \u201cboth the design of the products and the manufacturing techniques are head and shoulders above anything else that is present in industry\u201d creating high expectations from the shareholders. He also predicted that the combined sales of those two new products alone would be \u201cin excess of 5 million units per year\u201d, although he clarified that this is just \u201cElon\u2019s guess\u201d jokingly adding \u201cDon\u2019t sue me\u201d. Musk didn\u2019t clarify if those products are the upcoming facelifts for the Model 3 (Project Highland) and the Model Y (Project Juniper) which are expected to enter production in autumn 2023 and in late 2024 respectively. However, the single shadowy teaser that appeared on the screen looks very similar to the Tesla Model Y, making it less likely to be an all-new and smaller-sized EV. The sloping roofline appears to be unchanged, with a few revisions on the short bonnet and the tail. Judging from leaked photos, rumors, and insider information, the facelifted Model 3 and Y will feature a number of exterior and interior updates, focused on making them cheaper to produce and more technologically advanced in order to stay relevant against a growing number of competitors. You can watch the part of the presentation where Elon Musk talks about the new products after the 29.15 mark in the video below.","filter_flag":1}

As the business revealed at last week\u2019s Sweets & Snacks Expo event in Chicago (see our exclusive video review of the event here), it has continued its focus on delivering a broad portfolio of products across its brands, as well as improving business resilience amid notable market challenges. Speaking to Confectionery Production at the event, the company explained that it had enjoyed a strong performance in the past year and intended to build on its core principles to grow the business sustainably and support employment diversity (see our next edition for more). Notably, the firm\u2019s ESG report highlighted its inaugural double materiality assessment and an update to the company\u2019s key human rights issues \u2013 including targeting improving lives of cocoa farming communities at the centre of its supply chain. The company added that it is also focused on reducing its environmental impact and encouraging more diversity within its workforce. \u201cAs we continue to act on the most important areas of focus for our business, including responsible sourcing, reducing our carbon footprint, and promoting inclusivity, we are continually reminded that our progress and achievements are made possible by our employees, farmers, partners and other stakeholders who share our commitment to creating a more sustainable and equitable future,\u201d said Michele Buck, CEO, The Hershey Company. \u201cWe are grateful for their input and support and look forward to continuing this journey together.\u201d Significantly, by 2030, Hershey\u2019s Cocoa For Good strategy seeks to invest $500 million to positively impact cocoa farming communities. Hershey recently launched a new Income Accelerator in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a five-year program based on proven poverty reduction strategies that provides cash transfers and investment in Village Savings and Loan Associations to supplement farmer income and combat poverty. Additional cocoa highlights from 2022 include: Furthermore, in 2022, Hershey achieved 77% cocoa sourcing visibility by volume in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana and is on track to reach 100% sourcing visibility by 2025. As part of Hershey\u2019s commitment to prevent and eliminate child labor, participating farms are covered by Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation Systems (CLMRS). In 2022, 72% of farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana were covered by CLMRS, on track to reach 100% by 2025. The company added that its commitment to improving farmer livelihoods is grounded in empowering and investing in cocoa communities to foster a more equitable and sustainable cocoa supply chain. This includes supporting initiatives that provide financial literacy and agricultural training to farmers. Additionally, farmers in Ghana can contribute to emissions reductions through programs like the World Bank Carbon Fund and the Nsuoekyir Apimanim\u2019s Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs) and earn income as a result. Across its global operations and with the dedication of employees \u2013 including its passionate group of Energy Champions \u2013 the company is reducing its environmental impact with a goal to achieve a 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 against a 2018 baseline. In 2022, the company\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions data received limited assurance by EY. Additional environment highlights from 2022 include: In addition, Hershey\u2019s $3 million investment in reporting systems provides real-time utility usage data for electricity, natural gas and water at each of its facilities globally, aiming to reduce energy intensity by approximately 10% over the next five years. These systems were installed in U.S. facilities in 2022, with the remainder to be installed in international facilities during 2023. Leveraging biofuel to reduce carbon intensity: Hershey is taking action to limit and, when possible, remove carbon-intensive fuels from its facilities. Most recently, Hershey\u2019s India plant transitioned from using coal to rice husks as biofuel to power production. Enabled by Hershey\u2019s participation in the U.S. EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Buildings, Better Plants programme, the company has improved the energy intensity of its manufacturing sites by 6.1% compared to a 2018 baseline. With support from Hershey\u2019s Energy and Water Management Steering Committee, the company improved global water intensity by 6% in 2022 with a 14% improvement in water intensity at international facilities (compared to 2021). The company also invested nearly $1.5 million in high-efficiency equipment to reduce well water usage at our company headquarters in Hershey, PA. In terms of its employee policies, the company has a five-year diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) framework \u2013 the company continues to develop and invest in a pipeline that provides opportunities for all. Most recently, Hershey was named to DiversityInc\u2019s 2023 \u2018Top Companies for Diversity\u2019 list \u2013 underscoring the company\u2019s ongoing work to create an inclusive environment that fosters innovation and growth. Additional highlights from 2022 include: Furthermore, it has also launched its\u2019Say Hola\u2019 initiative at the company\u2019s Hazleton, Pennsylvania plant, \u2018Say Hola\u2019 seamlessly integrated both Spanish and English-speaking employees under one roof, equipped with bilingual trainings, managers and workplace materials. The program improved hiring and retention and reduced recruitment costs. Today, more than 90% of applicants have the desired manufacturing experience, compared to 50% before the programme launch. Moreover, as part of its commitment to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, veterans are an important part of the company\u2019s workforce, bringing specialised perspectives, experiences and skill sets to the business. In 2023, the company will expand its partnership with three military hiring organisations and aims to increase veteran hiring by 4%. Under the guidance of its Veteran Business Resource Group (employee resource group), Hershey joined the National Veterans Business Development Council and donated to Veterans Outreach of PA, a nonprofit that supports homeless veterans.

The fund aims to restore and protect B.C.\u2019s marine environment by removing derelict vessels and cleaning up marine debris along more than 4,600 kilometres of shoreline, while creating more than 1,700 well-paying jobs, according to a news release by the province. The announcement was made May 30 at Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park near Parksville. \u201cWe are fortunate to live in a community next to the beautiful shorelines and rich biodiversity of the Salish Sea. Thanks to the Clean Coast, Clean Waters initiative, these natural spaces can be sustainably maintained and support a healthy coastal ecotourism economy in B.C.,\u201d said Adam Walker, MLA for Parksville-Qualicum. Marine debris is collected and managed appropriately, with the goal of recycling as much as possible to reduce the amount of material going to landfills. To date, 64 per cent of shoreline materials have been recycled or up-cycled. Recyclable items are sent to the Ocean Legacy Foundation facility in Steveston for processing into new products, such as pellets that can be used to create new plastic materials. \u201cThe Clean Coast, Clean Waters initiative has removed over 1,500 tonnes of marine debris to date, including 118 derelict vessels,\u201d said Nathan Cullen, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship. \u201cPreventing and cleaning up marine pollution is essential to a healthy and productive coast, and is one aspect of our vision for B.C.\u2019s future as we develop a Coastal Marine Strategy in partnership with First Nations.\u201d READ MORE: Residents question RDN housing bylaw update delay The Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative will receive $4 million, bringing its total funding to $7.5 million since 2020. The remaining $21 million will be awarded to successful funding applicants through a merit-based assessment process, administered by PWC Canada. This initiative brings together nine First Nations living on B.C.\u2019s north and central coasts, and Haida Gwaii. They aim to restore and protect ecosystems through sustainable resource management practices, which promote self-sufficiency and improve the quality of life for people in these communities. \u201cThese shoreline cleanup projects are not just important for keeping coastal territories clean, they also support the transfer of Indigenous knowledge and practices to a younger generation,\u201d said Christine Smith-Martin, chief executive officer, Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative. \u201cBy sharing their success stories, best practices and challenges in marine debris collection and monitoring, First Nations across the North and Central Coast and Haida Gwaii continue to work together as stewards of the land and sea.\u201d Eligible funding applicants for the merit-based process include coastal First Nations and local governments, as well as non-profits and others with expertise in shoreline debris cleanup or removal of derelict vessels. The funding will be distributed in two rounds, one this spring and another planned for early 2024. The first application period has ended. Successful recipients will be notified in June to allow projects to begin this summer. Projects from the first round must be completed, have their data collected and final reports submitted by Feb. 29, 2024. Clean Coast, Clean Waters is part of the CleanBC Plastics Action Plan. Its goal is to reduce plastic waste and pollution. The government is developing B.C.\u2019s first Coastal Marine Strategy to govern and plan for securing vast marine ecosystems and blue economy in the long term. The strategy guides improved stewardship of coastal marine environments, advances reconciliation with First Nations and fosters coastal community resilience. \u2014 NEWS Staff, submitted Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.","filter_flag":1}
