Approximately 30% of all materials used in our new products launched and manufactured in 2022 were recycled content. This includes recycled material used in our devices\u2019 aluminum, stainless steel, rare earth magnet, glass and plastic parts. For plastic specifically, 48% of all materials used came from recycled content. Using recycled materials also lowers the carbon footprint of our product manufacturing. For example, the aluminum in the phone enclosures of Pixel 7 and 7 Pro is made with 100 percent recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to using 100% primary aluminum. Providing new ways to repair phones Last year, we announced our partnership with iFixit to provide genuine Pixel spare parts, tools and documentation on models as far back as Pixel 2 for customers who are skilled in repair and independent service providers. This partnership, alongside our other mail-in and authorized service provider repair channels, expand the choices customers have in Pixel phone repair. Improving our packaging Product packaging typically contains many materials \u2014 like the plastic film materials you often see on electronic packages \u2014 which can be difficult to recycle. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to eliminating plastic from our hardware product packaging by 2025. Our latest packaging for Pixel 7 uses 99% plastic-free materials, getting us closer to this goal. Overall, in 2022, we reduced Pixel packaging plastic by 97%, and reduced the volume of packages by 54% and the weight by over 50% when compared to our first Pixel phone.","filter_flag":1}

A circular economy is an economic model that emphasises the efficient use and reuse of resources, products and materials in order to minimise waste and pollution. By prioritising circular economies, brands are able to capitalise on economic benefits, while also meeting the ever-rising demand for sustainable strategists from consumers. That\u2019s why, we\u2019ve rounded up our top 10 brands embracing the circular economy in 2023. Patagonia has been at the forefront of the circular economy movement since first making a sustainability commitment in 1986. The apparel brand aims to reduce its environmental impact through a number of different initiatives, including The Worn Wear programme, which encourages customers to repair, reuse, and recycle their garments. The programme offers a repair service that addresses any damages to the clothing, as well as a trade-in option where customers are provided with store credits for used Patagonia clothing. Through this initiative, Patagonia has successfully prolonged the lifespan of its products while also minimising waste. The brand also introduced a line of clothing that incorporates recycled materials and uses organic cotton and other sustainable fibres. By adopting sustainable materials, Patagonia is making strides to reduce the environmental impact of its products and promote a circular economy.","filter_flag":1}

Generic environmental, social, and governance (ESG) offers will not be enough to win in this changing landscape (see sidebar, \u201cAbout the survey\u201d). Here are five insights from the survey and their implications for financial institutions: 1. Demand for green financial products is both strong and broad\u2014and is not limited to a niche segment About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by William Edwards, Ritesh Jain, Marie-Claude Nadeau, Charlotte Soehner, and Daniel Stephens, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Global Banking and Sustainability Practices. Nearly 40 percent of US consumers report interest in enrolling in a climate-linked financial product (Exhibit 1). The survey referred to these products specifically (for example, a green checking account or a climate-screened index fund), not as generic sustainability or ESG products. Of the interested consumers, the majority see this as a potentially major change in behavior, rather than a passing curiosity; two in three would allocate more than 40 percent of their savings or monthly credit card spending to a green retail banking product. 1 About the survey We conducted an extensive survey in late 2022 of a representative sample of 3,000 American consumers aged 25 and older to gather their perspectives on consumer financial products with sustainability features, with a specific focus on climate-linked products. The survey garnered responses on consumer appetite for financial products, consumer willingness to pay for financial products, and consumer attitudes toward their financial institutions. We measured consumer interest in and willingness to pay for five climate-linked financial products or service offerings: Savings and checking accounts, such as green deposit accounts that use ring-fenced deposits to support green lending Green credit cards, with rewards points based on shopping behaviors or carbon footprint tracking features Lending programs, such as residential-solar lending and electric-vehicle lending Investment products, such as climate-screened index funds Advisory services, for example, in such areas as home efficiency improvement For the purposes of this article, eligible respondents are defined as those with at least one of the following: personal checking account, personal savings account, personal credit card, or personal investment fund. Interested respondents are consumers who report interest in a climate-linked financial product. The segment of interested consumers went well beyond high-earning city dwellers\u2014in fact, consumer interest is not highly correlated with geography or income. For example, 24 percent of these interested customers live in rural areas, which is roughly equal to the share of the total US population living in rural areas, according to the US Census Bureau (Exhibit 2). Likewise, interested consumers were not limited to the top end of the market\u2014for instance, the balance size of savings accounts was roughly the same among consumers interested in green savings accounts as it was among those who weren\u2019t interested in the accounts (Exhibit 3). 2 3 2. Green offerings are a business opportunity for financial institutions, not a concession Many green financial products are designed and sold as \u201cconcessionary\u201d offerings\u2014for example, discounts on borrowing for electric vehicles or enhanced rewards on a credit card. One side effect of this approach is that concessionary products, because they are less financially accretive, tend not to scale into attractive businesses. However, our research shows that in many instances, consumers are willing to pay more for climate-linked financial products, especially in the context of savings, investing, and personal advice, if those products create measurable or demonstrable impact in exchange\u2014but that can be a big \u201cif.\u201d We observed this in the case of a green savings offering, where consumer deposits are ring-fenced for lending activity to sustainable borrowers. Up to 40 percent of consumers said they would choose a green savings account with an annual percentage yield (APY) that was 20 percent lower than a traditional savings account. A quarter of consumers said they would take an account with a 60 percent lower APY. This research was carried out in late 2022, when national savings rates had already increased, and these impacts therefore implied relatively meaningful financial trade-offs. We saw the same phenomenon with respect to climate-linked investments. ESG funds have for years charged higher-than-average fees. However, the emerging opportunity is not for derivative ESG offerings. The opportunity would seem to be to create more specific, actionable, climate-linked products that connect to both an investment thesis and a thesis of societal benefit (Exhibit 4). 4 3. Consumers are eager for advice and support from their financial partners Consumers are often overwhelmed and confused by the transition to more sustainable ways of living. They are inundated with offers\u2014such as rooftop solar systems, electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, insulation upgrades, sustainable investment products, and personal carbon calculators\u2014but they do not have easy access to quality technical and financial advice on how, or whether, to incorporate these offers into their lives. This is a space where banks are well positioned to serve their customers; for instance, two in three consumers would rather partner with their bank on financing a solar panel purchase than work directly with a solar panel installation company. Consumers may prefer banks because of perceived trustworthiness, perceived expertise, existing relationships, and the perception that many of these decisions\u2014whether investing in a 401(k), buying an electric vehicle, or replacing an old furnace\u2014will fundamentally be investment decisions that naturally require a thoughtful financial analysis (Exhibit 5). 5 4. Consumers need to be educated\u2014they may not yet have strong perspectives about which green offerings best suit their needs While consumer interest in climate-linked financial products is genuine, consumer understanding of those products\u2014the types of products, their impact, their benefits, etcetera\u2014is quite low. Financial institutions will need to educate customers on the climate and financial-value proposition of their offerings, both to frame the appeal of those offerings and to direct consumers toward products that suit their needs. In our survey, we showed consumers four different value propositions associated with a green savings account (Exhibit 6). The consumer response to the four different product offers was almost evenly split. This might indicate truly even preferences across all four types, but often such a result is consistent with consumers not understanding the product offer deeply enough to express a real preference. This same phenomenon of even distribution across three very different product offers repeated itself with respect to investment products. 6 As financial institutions create more offers in this space, it will be critical that they educate customers on those offers. But it is also critical that these product offers be robust in their claims on climate impact\u2014risk modeling and reputational risk for these products must be tightly managed. To ensure the development of a sustainable and inclusive economy, sustainability-related claims need to be backed by genuine actions. 5. Consumers do not yet differentiate between banks on climate topics, leaving an opportunity for banks to stake a claim as credible, innovative, and leading in this emerging market Across banks, there is almost no separation in how consumers perceive climate offerings and a bank\u2019s performance on climate commitments. According to multiple indicators of consumer confidence, few if any players truly stand out as a green leader (Exhibit 7). 7 We asked consumers four questions about their financial partners\u2019 green credentials. No bank scored higher than 59 percent across any of the questions, and the average scores are all well below 50 percent, ranging from 24 percent to 42 percent. Even after five-plus years of green efforts, including paperless billing and social responsibility pushes, financial institutions have yet to establish themselves as credible partners on the climate transition. Firms can start working now on defining and communicating an engaging, accessible climate brand to support their product and service ambitions, or risk remaining in the middle of the pack. Capturing the green opportunity Some financial institutions are already thinking creatively about capturing the green opportunity. For example, one mortgage lender has included an option for rooftop solar installation and financing as a standard part of its home purchase package. One wealth management firm has developed targeted investment products focused on specific value-creation hypotheses for the climate transition, rather than generic ESG or impact investment products. Another wealth manager is conducting personal balance sheet risk assessments for clients that incorporate climate risk into personal property and assets. There are a few steps we believe financial institutions can take right away to begin to capture the opportunities: Find product market fit by identifying a real customer need that can be served in a unique way with a financial product\u2014and quickly conduct tests to understand discrepancies between consumers\u2019 stated interest and actual behavior. Identify the steps needed to build, launch, and scale climate products\u2014including data, technology, operations, underwriting, risk, marketing, and sales considerations. Design the organizational operating model to support the new product, including dependencies on the \u201ccore\u201d (for example, technology, distribution, and risk). Determine the markers of success in the first two to three years (before most new products break even). Changing policies, expanding incentives, and rapidly decreasing technology costs have the potential to transform the way Americans live. Now, more than ever, financial institutions are well positioned to partner with consumers on their decarbonization journeys and could reap the strategic and financial benefits.","filter_flag":1}

The CPG sector significantly lags other industries in what BCG calls \u201cinnovation readiness,\u201d the underlying capabilities or \u201csystems\u201d that organizations deploy to generate new value propositions and profitably solve customer problems. According to our 2020 MIC findings, companies with mature innovation systems generate as much as 20% more innovation output than their peers. Concerned Consumers The lack of CPG preparedness is especially significant given consumers\u2019 growing climate concerns\u2014and the shift in their buying habits over the past few years. Approximately 80% of consumers say they think about sustainability in their day-to-day purchasing decisions. Also, according to the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business, between 2015 and 2021, sales of products marketed as sustainable grew 2.7 times faster than conventionally marketed products. However, today, only around 10% of CPG shoppers (8% to 18% across the categories we tested) say they purchase sustainable products or have sustainability in their top drivers of choice. This percentage could increase by up to 30% if CPG companies linked sustainability to other emotional and functional needs, such as quality or health. Other BCG research determined that 75% of consumers think that large companies must take the lead against climate change. Clearly, CPG companies must use this opportunity to raise the level of their sustainability efforts. Innovating on Three Levels Given the sheer size and complexity of the value chain, organizations that wish to achieve game-changing innovation in CPG must execute sustainability well at scale. This journey requires applying an innovation lens to three dimensions: products, customers, and advanced digital and AI tools. Improve Today\u2019s Products and Invent Tomorrow\u2019s As a first step toward greater sustainability, organizations should assess their product portfolio to identify the brands that can be made greener as well as those that require marketing to drive awareness and conversion. This is also the time to determine whether any brands should be divested because they don\u2019t align with corporate sustainability ambitions. That move can help fund opportunities in existing brands as well as new categories with greater potential. Product-development teams can then make existing products greener by replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones. Yet while this approach can provide some quick wins, it won\u2019t suffice over the long term. Based on our experience, re-engineering of current operations may achieve only about 30% to 40% of 2030 carbon goals; it is necessary to re-imagine the business model to close the gap, which will require both a transformational portfolio and consumer behavior change. Replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones won\u2019t suffice over the long term. To create truly sustainable products in the future, companies need to develop new products based on new formulations. (See the sidebar on Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev.) Since the primary source of CPG emissions is Scope 3 (the value chain, especially upstream), organizations need to ensure that their suppliers meet sustainability standards. How Two Leading CPGs Are Using Innovation to Boost Sustainability across the Value Chain Leading CPG companies like Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev (ABI) have launched initiatives with the potential for large-scale impact as they put sustainability at the top of their ESG agenda, as well as their overall business agenda. Nestl\u00e9 Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. After determining the carbon footprint of its portfolio, the company has put more emphasis on expansion in the plant-based space, an important commercial and environmental opportunity. To make existing products carbon neutral, Nestl\u00e9 has substituted ingredients and changed entire formulations. The company\u2019s sustainable R&D accelerator and creative application of new R&D processes inspired the formulation used in brands such as Wunda, a pea-based milk alternative. Nestl\u00e9 has also committed to making its product packaging 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. In addition, it has shifted manufacturing to renewable energy and invested in more energy-efficient processes. And it has optimized routes and used low-emission fuels and rail transport. Together, these measures are projected to mitigate 14% of greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the projected 44 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalents by 2030. To fill out its plant-based portfolio, Nestl\u00e9 has also made some noteworthy acquisitions, including Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth foods. In parallel, the company has sold its North American bottled-water business, a slow-growing business with a large environmental footprint, to fund investments in higher-growth categories. This slew of product innovations has been enabled by Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team. A top CEO priority, sustainably minded innovation receives sufficient resources and focus. Moreover, teams are encouraged to explore emerging categories and find applications for R&D developments across the Nestl\u00e9 portfolio. For example, Nestl\u00e9 is using lessons from Wunda to develop other innovations in the dairy-alternative space. By embedding sustainability every step of the way, Nestl\u00e9 is driving both incremental and game-changing innovation\u2014and raising the bar in the process. ABI To help address the growing global demand for food and the pressure this is putting on natural resources, ABI is leveraging its brewing expertise to find new ways of sourcing food sustainably. In addition to rolling out many incremental innovations, ABI has launched ventures that develop new-to-world technologies. One of its startups, EverGrain, is developing a technology that extracts the proteins and fibers from brewing grains to create nutrient-rich ingredients for use in protein shakes, breads, and milk alternatives. Another startup, BioBrew, is using ABI\u2019s fermentation knowledge to scale production of alternative proteins. ABI\u2019s ventures are expected to help reduce crop- and livestock-related carbon emissions from food production while providing access to new markets Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. After determining the carbon footprint of its portfolio, the company has put more emphasis on expansion in the plant-based space, an important commercial and environmental opportunity.To make existing products carbon neutral, Nestl\u00e9 has substituted ingredients and changed entire formulations. The company\u2019s sustainable R&D accelerator and creative application of new R&D processes inspired the formulation used in brands such as Wunda, a pea-based milk alternative.Nestl\u00e9 has also committed to making its product packaging 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. In addition, it has shifted manufacturing to renewable energy and invested in more energy-efficient processes. And it has optimized routes and used low-emission fuels and rail transport.Together, these measures are projected to mitigate 14% of greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the projected 44 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalents by 2030.To fill out its plant-based portfolio, Nestl\u00e9 has also made some noteworthy acquisitions, including Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth foods. In parallel, the company has sold its North American bottled-water business, a slow-growing business with a large environmental footprint, to fund investments in higher-growth categories.This slew of product innovations has been enabled by Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team. A top CEO priority, sustainably minded innovation receives sufficient resources and focus. Moreover, teams are encouraged to explore emerging categories and find applications for R&D developments across the Nestl\u00e9 portfolio. For example, Nestl\u00e9 is using lessons from Wunda to develop other innovations in the dairy-alternative space.By embedding sustainability every step of the way, Nestl\u00e9 is driving both incremental and game-changing innovation\u2014and raising the bar in the process.To help address the growing global demand for food and the pressure this is putting on natural resources, ABI is leveraging its brewing expertise to find new ways of sourcing food sustainably.

This is a huge undertaking, requiring bold experimentation with supply-chain and sourcing models. Companies will need to expand their roster of partners. They will also need to change relationships with existing partners to active collaborations where companies share product-development expertise and work with suppliers to develop sustainable practices. Since CPG companies are positioned to be the steward of the value chain, they need to engage with partners to drive broader impact. Guinness, for example, recently launched a regenerative-agriculture pilot in Ireland to reduce the carbon emissions from producing barley, a key raw material. Working with farmers and other suppliers, Guinness expects to see improvements in soil health and water quality, as well as enhanced biodiversity. Help Consumers Change Their Behaviors While these efforts will go a long way, innovation in CPG won\u2019t be able to maximize the impact of decarbonization measures unless consumers take a more active role. Yet while consumers are increasingly concerned about the climate crisis, many have not yet incorporated sustainability into their everyday behaviors, and many are confused about their role (around 20% say that individuals have a role to play in climate change). Companies, therefore, need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. One solution is to innovate and commercialize products in a way that resonates deeply with potential buyers, understanding their core needs and barriers to ensure that sustainable products address them. To maximize the impact of decarbonization measures, companies need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. That is exactly what Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s Finish did in 2020, when the maker of dishwashing products launched \u201cSkip the Rinse,\u201d a campaign that aimed to drive growth and also conserve water by encouraging consumers not to pre-rinse their dishes. Reckitt innovated its product, and the key benefit was that busy families could save time and effort while effectively cleaning their dishes, which appealed to a much broader audience than sustainability alone. As an added benefit, for every consumer who pledged to #skiptherinse, Finish agreed to donate $1 to The Nature Conservancy. In less than two years, more than 20 million gallons of water were conserved. In addition, Finish drove share growth and increased marketing ROI. Deploy Next-Generation Digital and AI Tools Advanced analytics driven by AI provide the transparency that\u2019s necessary for identifying the C&S leads with the greatest likelihood of success. These next-generation tools include machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping, Unlike traditional methods, advanced analytics allow an organization to combine multiple data sources to identify potential targets across multiple sectors globally and further upstream. Moreover, they enable the automated scraping of websites and social media to identify business signals (triggers) in areas of the organization\u2019s choosing, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Third, they help to quickly narrow down searches to a short list of the most promising opportunities. No less important, these tools enable traceability, both for companies that wish to monitor the greenness of their suppliers and for consumers who want to know whether the product they\u2019re thinking of purchasing has green roots. Advanced analytics can help identify C&S leads and enable traceability. Given both the immensity of the C&S opportunity and our relative nascency in addressing it, advanced analytics and AI tools (including machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping) can help drive impact at critical junctures across the innovation value chain. Companies deploying these tools will be better able to surface valuable insights, prioritize the innovation focus, explore the C&S implications of potential product features during the design stage, and identify emerging technologies and partners to add to their innovation ecosystems. In all likelihood, CPG companies will play a central role in the ultimate success or failure of the C&S effort. Therefore, it\u2019s only fitting that they use this role to bring us closer to a decarbonized future. By applying an innovative lens to the sustainability agenda, companies can create value\u2014for the environment, for consumers, and for themselves. But to create a real sustainability advantage, organizations must act now, before this source of differentiation evaporates.","filter_flag":1}

A global push to live more sustainably and reduce our collective carbon footprint is compelling manufacturers to rethink how products are created. Consider these three phases of window and door products\u2019 lifecycle: Manufacturing, the life of the product in a structure, and end-of-life recyclability. Paul Adams, who has been with Deceuninck North America for more than 15 years and currently serves as the global vice president of materials innovation, discussed the importance of creating formulas that meet multiple industry and sustainability criteria, remain respectful of the environment, and are recyclable at the end of their lifecycle. Deceuninck\u2019s Innergy is a composite made of up to 20 percent bio-based resin and is designed to maximize thermal performance. Climate change considerations During the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s 2021 Materials Day symposium, research scientist and professor Elsa Olivetti began her opening remarks with, \u201cMaterials play a central role in all aspects of the new technologies needed to achieve sustainability goals and address climate change.\u201d The focus on designing sustainable materials pervades all industries, but it is particularly relevant to the building, design and construction space since it creates a third of the world\u2019s waste. The climate crisis and ever-increasing global temperatures have placed a greater demand on the research that goes into advancing polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, formulas that the window and door industry uses. The ones previously relied upon are not as effective as they once were. The environment is changing, which mandates higher-performing, longer-lasting windows. \u201cWe must create windows for today, not for an environment that existed 20 years ago,\u201d Adams stresses. \u201cThese new products must endure for 25 or 30 years, in addition to remaining recyclable and maintaining 90 percent of their original physical properties at the end of their lifecycle.\u201d Because higher outside temperatures cause window systems to degrade, materials science teams worldwide are emphasizing the development of new chemistries. \u201cMuch of what we do is in response to climate change and is in line with the overall sustainability model of our organization,\u201d Adams notes. A closer look at chemistry Where there\u2019s color, there must be the right chemistry in place to allow it to shine over the long haul. Color plays a big role in the increased homeowner and architect demand for aesthetic options, and the demand for new pigments and properties has required manufacturers in the window and door industry to spend more research and development hours on pigment chemistry. To move the needle, organizations are even tapping into what works in other sectors. \u201cWe explored paints and coatings used specifically for military vehicles that are designed to reflect heat. We then applied that technology to building materials such as PVC extrusions to reduce heat gain in windows,\u201d explains Adams. Material chemistry also plays a key role in creating products that contribute to a more sustainable built environment. Using plant-based additives is an excellent place to start. Utilizing natural materials creates a cleaner final product that is more recyclable at the end of its lifecycle. One might not traditionally think \u201cplants\u201d when considering the elements used to create windows or other plastics products, but these sustainable, organic materials can be used as lubricants and serve other important functions in the production of PVC windows and doors. Looking at material chemistry can also help manufacturers identify methods to reduce other common concerns for window and door profiles, including fading. Helping the homeowner Eco-conscious consumers are paying attention to the environment and want to live in homes that save energy and minimize harmful effects on the planet. The industry is progressing, as today\u2019s window and door extrusions are comprised of more eco-friendly materials compared to plastics of the past. This starts at stage one: the composition of the materials used to create the window systems from the start. Manufacturers need to anticipate what homeowners will need. Energy-efficiency requirements for windows vary by jurisdiction and by climate, but regardless of region, by reducing the amount of thermal loss through a window frame, less energy is required to heat or cool a home. This has a positive impact on the environment, can decrease annual energy costs for homeowners, and create a more comfortable living environment. Challenges creating opportunity Supply chain constraints over the past couple of years resulted in the need for manufacturers to shift toward alternative raw material options and, in some cases, complete reformulation. Teams had to adjust and find new ways to create while maintaining or improving upon the properties of materials. This highlights the importance of remaining on the cutting edge of innovation. As it specifically relates to materials science, Adams shares his organization\u2019s plans for moving forward. \u201cDeceuninck is always striving for better-performing products that protect our environment and make use of natural materials,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIf we\u2019re not pushing the boundaries on innovation and keeping the promise of sustainability at the forefront of product development, we\u2019re not doing our part.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

In data collected by Circana, a merger between IRI and The NPD Group, and the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business in September 2022, 93% of consumers surveyed said they maintained or increased their sustainable purchase habits in the past year, with 77% of consumers believing sustainability is important when selecting products to buy, which was up from 69% in 2021. Among consumer packaged goods (CPG), sustainable products represented just 17% of total sales, but they drove one-third of all CPG growth over the past year. \u201cChallenges such as supply chain disruptions and inflation have made it difficult for brands and manufacturers to identify which shopping behaviors are real trends, and which are a temporary response to market conditions,\u201d said Randi Kronthal-Sacco, senior scholar at NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business in September. \u201cEach year, our research with IRI shows increasing interest in sustainability-marketed CPG products, showing that sustainability has become a lasting priority for consumers.\u201d The International Food Information Council (IFIC) identified upcycled plant-based products as a trend within the food and beverage industry in 2023. Formally defined in 2020, upcycled ingredients include components of foods that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, which are both procured and produced using verifiable supply chains. Innova Markets Insights, Arnhem, The Netherlands, tracked consumer sentiment toward foods formulated with upcycled ingredients for several years, and in 2022, the market research firm found more than a third of consumers considered upcycled products to be more appealing than other products. \u201cThis overall trend provides manufacturers with opportunities for storytelling,\u201d said Lu Ann Williams, global insights director at Innova Market Insights, in an April interview. \u201cAccording to our database of global food and beverage launches, North American food and beverage launches with a food waste and\/or upcycling claim experienced 52% average annual growth between 2017 and 2021.\u201d Upcycled ingredient applications span their way across the grocery store, from the snack aisle to the beverage aisle. Minus Coffee will be making its debut in 2023 as a bean-less coffee, instead opting for roasted upcycled roots, seeds and legumes as its base instead of coffee beans. In a canned cold-brew offering, the bean-less coffee is formulated with date seeds, chicory, sunflower seeds, carob, lentils, grape seeds and millet malt. Production involves significantly less water, fewer carbon emissions and a shorter supply chain than conventional coffee, said Maricel Saenz, founder and chief executive officer of parent company Compound Foods. \u201cInstead of beans, we roast upcycled roots, seeds and legumes, which we then grind and brew in a gorgeous fermentation batch with caffeine,\u201d Ms. Saenz said. \u201cI am proud to say that we have successfully recreated the flavors, aromas and effects of coffee while eliminating the crop itself from the chain, a crop that is the sixth most pollutive agricultural process concentrated in regions around the equator.\u201d Kazoo Snacks uses corn germ as an upcycled ingredient in its tortilla chips, which are making their way to Sprouts Farmers Market locations nationwide in April. Manufacturing with corn germ as the main ingredient allows Kazoo Snacks to use 40% less whole corn and save 16 gallons of water per bag, according to the company. It also gives a complex nutrient profile to the chips, which contain essential nutrients, enzymes and vitamin E all included in the corn germ. Food entrepreneurs and native Ecuadorians Juan Illingworth and Gaby Macias at Brutal Foods also opted for a complex and beneficial nutrient profile by choosing chocho, or the Andean lupin, as the star of their snack products. The regenerative bean, which is cultivated at high altitudes, has more protein per serving than salmon, tofu or chickpeas, with fiber, calcium and the nine essential amino acids. \u201cOther beans and nuts already had their moment for years,\u201d said Mr. Illingworth, co-founder of Brutal Foods, in a March interview. \u201cIt\u2019s chocho\u2019s time to get the place it deserves\u2026 So, we have been creating these baked crunchy puffs and brand for almost two years and focused on the real things that we consider important without sacrificing the pleasure of indulging.\u201d Click to view new sustainable innovations.","filter_flag":1}

Home Depot\u2019s chief sustainability officer Ron Jarvis has spent more than two decades driving sustainability improvements at The Home Depot. Here he offers insights into our progress. Who drives ESG at The Home Depot? Many associates and business leaders throughout our enterprise! They take pride in improving their departments and businesses in multiple ESG aspects. Our leadership understands that an effective environmental, social and governance strategy cannot happen in isolation. It is not the sole responsibility of a corporate ESG team. Rather, our ESG strategy must reflect The Home Depot\u2019s core values, and it must be embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Everybody owns it. How have associates helped drive ESG progress at The Home Depot? One of our eight core values is Do The Right Thing, which drives our associates to find new ways that our organization can reduce its environmental impact. This can be seen through our packaging team who looks for ways to reduce the package footprints and ways to use more sustainable materials for our private-label products. Another example are our associates who work to find ways to upcycle the packaging waste in our stores and supply chain into new products like Trex composite decking. How is The Home Depot helping customers increase the sustainability of their homes and businesses? Our Eco Actions program, which builds on our original Eco Options program that we launched in 2007, helps our customers take on more sustainable DIY projects and choose greener products that can save water, conserve energy or are formulated to reduce certain chemicals. Products can only qualify for this distinction if manufacturers provide third-party verification of environmental claims that meet our program\u2019s requirements. This program also offers customers green project ideas and tips, for example, how to grow an organic garden. In addition, we encourage our customers to drop off used compact fluorescent light bulbs and rechargeable batteries for recycling. In 2021, we collected 1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 24% increase since 2014. We also help our customers go greener in ways that may be less apparent to them. For example, we offer circularity-centered products like our Home Depot-branded moving boxes, made from 100% post- consumer recycled paper fiber, as well as composite deck boards made from recycled plastic waste from our stores. We continue to make progress on our goal to exclude expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand product packaging by the end of 2023. When customers rent tools from us, they help avoid the environmental impact of new product manufacturing. Another example: Our stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing our customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment. Is sustainability a competitive advantage for The Home Depot? Overall, we believe good business decisions drive sustainability. Examples of this can be seen through the investments we\u2019ve made to create the most efficient supply chain in home improvement. These investments have helped us reduce the number of trucks needed and distance traveled to get our products from our supplier to our customers, while also reducing fuel emissions. Another example of this is our store investments, part of which included transitioning stores to LED lighting, which helped us reduce operating costs and electricity consumption. We also believe that by working with our suppliers to bring innovative and sustainable products to market, we help our customers create more sustainable homes and workplaces. Our efforts to drive innovation can be seen in every aisle of the store, and we believe this is a key differentiator in the market. We also want to see sustainability be the norm for our entire industry. We are encouraged when we see other retailers take big swings and do innovative things that push all of us to do a better job of protecting the planet, and we hope the innovation that we bring through our operations and products motivates others to do the same.","filter_flag":1}

At launch, Partners for Tomorrow programs include: CIRQU (the latest evolution of the PBNA-led program formerly known as BottleLoop): CIRQU includes the on-demand collection of recyclable beverage containers for foodservice and retail customers, which are then processed and reclaimed by PepsiCo to become recycled PET packaging. PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA) has partnered with Replenysh to make it easy and free for its customers to help ensure that plastic, glass, and aluminum containers are collected and recycled and that the recycled materials are integrated into the supply chain to be reused. The program expanded to serve five times as many communities in 2022, compared to 2021. There are currently over 250 host locations actively collecting material across 10 states and 58 communities.

Reusable Cup Solutions: PepsiCo is piloting several reusable cup solutions with partners in select markets in support of PepsiCo's goal to have 20 percent of all beverage servings it sells delivered through reusable models by 2030. Most recently, PepsiCo kicked off a reusable cup pilot timed to the Oak View Group's grand re-opening of the newly renovated CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore, Maryland . Working with TURN, the system features gamification to incentivize event attendees to return the reusable cups after use. Previously, the PepsiCo Foodservice team developed branded aluminum \"collector\" cups in partnership with a leading convenience retailer and SodaStream ran a university on-campus pilot that paired SodaStream in home units for dorm rooms with a reusable SodaStream bottle that could be refilled at various locations across campus.

Regenerative Agriculture: A Regenerative Agriculture program, which PepsiCo is calling sow+ Agriculture (Sow Positive Agriculture), is designed to enable PBNA and PFNA customers to make direct investments in efforts to convert agricultural land to regeneratively farmed acreage and to allow PepsiCo and its suppliers to drive progress toward regenerative agriculture goals. The investments will directly assist farmers through loans and grants with the aim to convert their land to new practices that help improve soil health, reduce erosion, and improve water quality. The program also provides a forum for convening industry influencers to discuss concepts, trends, opportunities, and risks around regenerative farming.

Because many small and medium businesses face challenges when trying to participate in the renewable electricity market, pep+ REnew is designed with two goals: to educate PepsiCo's value chain partners about their renewable electricity choices, and to quicken the transition to renewable electricity through aggregate power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other renewable electricity procurement options. \"PepsiCo has a long history of working together with our partners to advance shared sustainability goals. The Partners for Tomorrow platform aims to scale those solutions to foster the most effective partnerships and longstanding impact,\" said Todd Squarek, Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer for PepsiCo Beverages North America. \"With this platform we're leveraging the shared scale of PepsiCo's and our customers' businesses to maximize impact, drive progress toward our pep+ goals, and benefit both our businesses, the planet and the communities we serve.\" Partners for Tomorrow is PepsiCo's latest offering that complements a suite of best-in-class customer capabilities ranging from product innovation to insights. \"At PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, our retail customers are true partners, including when it comes to addressing the impacts of climate change,\" said Cara Keating, Chief Customer Officer, Frito-Lay North America (FLNA). \"Through the launch of the Partners for Tomorrow platform and its robust portfolio of solutions, we are taking an important step forward in how we collaborate with our customers to progress toward critical sustainability goals, meet consumer demands, and, ultimately, drive commercial value together.\" Partners for Tomorrow is one of the many ways that PepsiCo is working to drive progress toward its multiple pep+ sustainability goals, while at the same time helping customers achieve their goals. PepsiCo's pep+ climate strategy focuses on everything in its supply chain, including manufacturing, agriculture, packaging, transportation, vending and cooling equipment and is an example of how PepsiCo's pep+ strategy can also help its customers achieve their sustainability goals. The work to improve PepsiCo's end-to-end supply chain aims to help drive progress toward the pep+ goals to achieve net-zero emissions across PepsiCo's value chain by 2040\u2014one decade earlier than called for in the Paris Agreement and also help its customers to see progress toward achieving their Scope 3 emissions reduction goals. Some of PepsiCo's key projects designed to drive progress against the company's pep+ ambitions for climate, packaging and agriculture include: Fleet Electrification: PepsiCo is implementing a fleet of electric vehicles at its facilities that aim to help reduce emissions on the journey to net zero. FLNA and PBNA received the first deliveries of Tesla electrified semi vehicles at their respective facilities in Modesto and Sacramento . FLNA and PBNA are further electrifying facility infrastructure, by rolling out electric forklifts, route trucks, service vans, and yard tractors.

Manufacturing and Fleet Excellence : Frito-Lay revealed the near completion of its 500,000-square feet facility in Modesto, California which is a first-of-its-kind showcase for sustainable manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution technologies. The transformation at Modesto includes replacing diesel fleet assets with Zero Emissions (ZE) and Near Zero Emissions (NZE) alternatives, installing fueling and charging infrastructure for the new fleet, and on-site renewable energy generation and storage. To date, the Modesto transformation has resulted in a 91% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the facility's direct fleet operations. Scheduled to open within the next year, PBNA's new Denver manufacturing facility aims to become net water positive, with a first-of-its-kind advanced water recycling system and robust replenishment in the local watershed. It also aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity, leveraging both solar and innovative biogas technologies. : Frito-Lay revealed the near completion of its 500,000-square feet facility in which is a first-of-its-kind showcase for sustainable manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution technologies.

PepsiCo estimates that shifting to bottles made from 100% rPET reduces GHG emissions by approximately 30% per bottle. By 2030, the entire Pepsi-branded portfolio aims to phase-out bottles made from virgin plastics.

Some feel there needs to be greater continuity among governments. States including California, Washington and Maryland have passed laws in an effort to enhance sustainability efforts and. help consumers better understand claims on packaging. But experts say there remains a long way to go with most states not discussing this issue of greenwashing, much less working to develop legislation, and few have hope of the federal government tackling the issue, given the divisive political climate in the nation\u2019s capital. However, some experts encourage retailers to become more involved in pushing government efforts to develop laws pertaining to greenwashing and sustainability overall. \u201cWhen governmental agencies are looking to develop or rewrite guidelines, this is an opportunity for retailers to have a seat at the table and help influence the decision being made,\u201d said Christine Miklosko, packaging solutions strategist with Quad. \u201cThis will allow them to figure out what the new rules mean and help them long term.\u201d The route that has been easier for many is working with third-party certifiers, such as Fair Trade USA, that have developed strong sustainability standards related to a variety of issues. \u201cWe have seen the issue of sustainability evolve over the years and now consumers are more aware and holding retailers and product suppliers to higher expectations,\u201d said Abby Ayers, senior director of Retail Partners with Fair Trade USA . \u201cAnd when we talk about greenwashing, it remains a challenging issue for most retailers and brands.\u201d Within the private label segment, any environmental-positive claims made by products fall to retailers, as their brands are on the packaging. As the work to avoid accidental greenwashing continues, Ayers said there are several steps retailers can take that are not difficult. For example, if a retailer is carrying a full line of baking products, she suggests making individual claims on each item and avoiding blanket statements that may not be true for every SKU in the assortment. Additionally, she encourages retailers and product suppliers to work with third-party certifiers to ensure that all claims being made are accurate. \u201cWe are happy to see that most retailers and product suppliers are bringing Fair Trade and other certifiers to the table to help substantiate claims they are looking to make,\u201d she said. \u201cWe offer an understanding of how to talk about certain issues and help them avoid any legal risks.\u201d Sofidel\u2019s Madrack noted that working with third-party certifiers has had a positive impact on the company and led to accolades for its efforts pertaining to sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019ve heavily invested in third-party certifications to prioritize transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, Sofidel is consistently ranked as one of the most sustainable companies in the paper industry according to CDP and EcoVadis. In 2022, Morningstar Sustainalytics ranked Sofidel as the top company in the Household Products category.\u201d Additionally, Sofidel uses 100% certified pulp for its paper products, such as those verified by the Forest Stewardship Council.","filter_flag":1}

For one, Coach hasn\u2019t disclosed plans to reduce its overall output. \u201c\u2018Do they have a meaningful plan in place to transition to making a meaningful portion of their revenue from resale and circularity?\u2019, would be a question I would ask,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a metric in place to define what meaningful displacement looks like, because no big brands are doing it at all.\u201d \u201cUsing creativity in a different way\u201d The leather scraps that make up so much of the launch collection come from two common sources of waste in the supply chain. The first is during production. When Coach bag patterns are cut from leather hides, they leave scraps behind: these are what became the starting point for designing the Coachtopia \u2018Ergo\u2019 and \u2018Wavy Dinky\u2019 bags, among others. The design team experimented with techniques \u2014 patchwork, weaving, appliqu\u00e9 and scrap-binding \u2014 to find ways to \u201cupcraft\u201d cutting room scraps, zipper ends and other would-be waste materials into artisanal styles. \u201cEven if you maximise the cutting space, there is still a lot of scrap left over \u2014 either the little bits in between the patterns, or around the edges \u2014 and all of those scraps previously went into landfill. All of our suppliers are now saving, collecting, sorting, storing, classifying all of those small, irregular, unpredictable constantly-changing scraps and we\u2019re using those as an input into our upcrafted leathers,\u201d says Silverstein. The other key source of leather waste are the tanneries, where scraps of tanned but not-yet-dyed leather tend to also end up in the landfill; Silverstein says Coach suppliers are now collecting those scraps as well so they can be designed into new products. Each type of waste, each type of product and each design comes with its own hurdles. \u201cOne of our most hero styles is this checkerboard pattern, which can easily absorb changing quantities of scrap \u2014 because one of the challenges with scrap is it\u2019s always changing,\u201d she says. The beauty of designing backwards, says creative director Stuart Vevers, is that it provides a fresh perspective on the entire process. \u201cAs a designer, this was a big new challenge for myself and the rest of the creative team,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term \u2018designing backwards\u2019, what that really means is that we look at the problem that we\u2019d like to tackle and then approach it that way \u2014 rather than just thinking of a great design first. It\u2019s using creativity in a different way.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Increasing competitive pressures, tight labor markets and growing environmental compliance objectives require organizations to adopt a more holistic management approach that spans the product and asset lifecycle. The companies will develop a combined software solution to help organizations optimize product lifecycles, and make it easier to improve traceability across processes, prototype and test concepts much earlier in development, and adopt more sustainable product designs. The goal is to help organizations speed innovation and time to market which can lead to improved quality and lowered costs. The new combined SysML v1 standards-based suite of integrated engineering software is expected to support traceability and sustainable product development using a digital thread that links mechanical, electronics, electrical engineering and software design and implementation. It is intended to span the product lifecycle, from early design and manufacturing to operations, maintenance, update and end of life management. Initially, the companies are working to connect IBM Engineering System Design Rhapsody for systems engineering with solutions from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio of software and services including Siemens\u2019 Teamcenter\u00ae software for Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Capital\u2122 software for electrical\/electronic (E\/E) systems development and software implementation. The companies have also connected the IBM Maximo Application Suite for asset management with Siemens\u2019 Teamcenter software to support an integrated digital thread between service engineering, asset management and services execution. These integrations will focus on the effective reuse of processes and materials to allow traceability for sustainable product development. This can help companies to make informed decisions earlier in the design and engineering process to help drive improvements in cost, performance and sustainability. For example, companies can more quickly identify under-performing components or design elements that consume excessive amounts of power, or require maintenance or early replacement, and product innovation can be driven through an integrated digital thread that connects the physical and software assets back into product development. \u201cA significant portion of product innovation and differentiation contains electrical, electronics and software components. Yet, manufacturing companies are struggling to bring new products to market on time, as the current tools, processes, and information to manage these components are siloed and disconnected,\u201d said Kareem Yusuf Ph.D, Senior Vice President, Product Management and Growth, IBM Software. \u201cTo address this gap, IBM and Siemens are collaborating on a digital thread environment to integrate sustainability practices throughout the lifecycle of a product, from design, production, operation, maintenance and beyond. This connectivity will help enable quicker time to innovation and compliance preparedness, and overall improved product quality.\u201d Siemens and IBM are also collaborating to create a SysML v2 based solution with a migration path to help customers transition to next generation systems engineering. SysML supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems. Service lifecycle management can assist in maximizing business value for product servitization by connecting service engineering to service maintenance to facilitate new collaborative processes between OEM and operators. \u201cTogether, Siemens and IBM will deliver a simulation-driven systems and software engineering solution that is designed to cover the full operational lifecycle. This can empower our customers to innovate by helping to reduce product development costs, drive continuous improvement and create operational efficiencies across the extended enterprise throughout the product\u2019s operation lifecycle,\u201d said Tony Hemmelgarn, President and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens Digital Industries Software. \u201cWe are developing this to help companies truly shift left by improving extensibility and reuse of systems models and associated data with standards-based solutions in an open ecosystem and to enable our customers to develop better products.\u201d Kamil Mrva, Chief Information Officer at \u0160KODA Group and early adopter of the service lifecycle and asset management solution, said: \u201cWe are working very closely together with Siemens and IBM to help us to reach our sustainability goals, reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) of products for our customers and support our business transformation with an increased focus on services.\u201d Siemens will be supported by benefits through IBM's newly launched Partner Plus program and will offer the solution as part of the Siemens Xcelerator ecosystem.

Caterpillar is represented by durable, reliable and innovative products. Many of our products are built to be rebuilt and our remanufacturing options deliver multiple sustainability benefits. By returning components at the end of their initial serviceable lives to like-new condition, we reduce waste and minimize the need for the raw material, energy and water to produce new parts. Caterpillar utilizes guidance from the GHG Protocol to calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions. Our Scope 3 emissions are estimated to be more than 95% of the company\u2019s total Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions inventory.1 Given the company\u2019s large, global customer base covering a diverse set of industries, including construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, diesel-electric locomotives, and others, Category 11 \u2014 use of sold products \u2014 is our largest Scope 3 category. The remaining fourteen categories of estimated Scope 3 emissions are either not relevant or are immaterial, representing collectively less than 5% of our total Scope 3 emissions. The five-year trend of Caterpillar\u2019s estimated Scope 3 use of sold products emissions illustrates annual emissions at the enterprise level and by primary business segment \u2014 CI, RI and E&T \u2014 as well as the enterprise sales and revenues trend and emissions intensity (MT CO2e divided by enterprise sales and revenues). Most of Caterpillar\u2019s emissions come from products with high-power output, high fuel consumption, high runtime and long product life.

For some sustainable tech companies, this includes using recycled plastics to make everything from laptops to camera bags. Other companies have made major long-term pledges to reduce \u2014 or in some cases, eliminate \u2014 their carbon footprints. Meanwhile, some brands are getting creative with their eco-friendly practices. This includes tree planting, sea-turtle conservation, and a host of pay-it-forward initiatives in between. This all means that consumers can also do their part to support the industry\u2019s shift toward environmentally friendly gear. All it takes is doing some research before buying, asking questions like: Is this company dedicated to sustainability? Does this product incorporate recycled materials? If you don\u2019t know where to start when determining a tech company\u2019s sustainability practices, you can start right here. Here are 11 tech and creative companies making environmentally conscious changes \u2014 and new products \u2014 that are both sustainable and innovative. HP HP is looking to drive its business into a low-carbon future. Since 2017, the company has launched over 300 new products containing ocean-bound plastic. More specifically, its HP Pavilion laptop speaker housing reuses over 92,000 plastic bottles annually alone. The company\u2019s ultimate goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the HP value chain by 2040. By 2030, its estimated to reach 75% circularity for its products and packaging. Starting in 2016, HP is set to recycle 1.2 million tonnes of hardware and supplies by 2025. Logitech Logitech is taking its environmentally-friendly practices seriously. Currently, 65 percent of mice and keyboards within the brand\u2019s largest product portfolio now incorporate post-consumer recycled plastic. This has immensely reduced Logitech\u2019s carbon impact, and goes above and beyond its initial commitment to 50 percent in 2020. The sheer numbers show this is much more than \u201cgoing green\u201d for the sake of a sustainability slogan. Logitech eliminated roughly 8,000 tons of virgin plastic from its products in 2021. Ultimately, this equates to an estimated 19,000 tons of CO2 preserved throughout a product\u2019s life cycle. For example, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse is a fully carbon neutral certified product. Samsung In July 2020, Samsung Semiconductor \u2014 the Samsung Electronics subsidiary responsible for memory, logic, LED components, LCD and OLED panels, and storage devices \u2014 introduced its DS Sustainable Management Office. This specific role, plus the creation of individual sustainability offices per division, shows how deep this eco-friendly dedication goes. What does this look like for Samsung? For one, all of Samsung\u2019s worksites in the U.S., Europe, and China operated with 100 percent renewable energy sources in 2020, according to the brand\u2019s most recent sustainability report. It also recently expanded its Galaxy Upcycling program, which lets consumers repurpose their used Galaxy smartphones as smart-home device. This ultimately saves these gadgets from taking up space in a landfill. Samsung has also introduced a variety of eco-friendly packaging options for not just recycling, but up-cycling. Acer Acer\u2019s eco-friendly Vero line is proof of the brand\u2019s intention to protect the environment. This line of sustainable products is made from recycled materials. It also includes an \u201ceco+\u201d option within its computers to let users control their energy effectiveness and cut down their carbon footprint. This innovative line is one of many ways Acer is going green. Through the brand\u2019s Earthion initiative, Acer vows its core products will have 30 percent post-consumer recycled content in its products by 2025. It also commits to an 80 percent carbon reduction by 2050. Acer products are poised to consume 45 percent less energy by 2025. Sony Sony\u2019s another technology brand with big eco-friendly aspirations. Since 2010, the brand has been working on its \u201croad to zero\u201d strategy. This is an environmental initiative with the goal of achieving a zero environmental footprint for the life cycle of Sony products and its business activities by 2050. To date, Sony has reduced its energy consumption by 54 percent. It has curbed CO2 emissions by using renewable energy and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent. Also, its waste generation is down 15 percent \u2014according to its latest sustainability figures. Additionally, last year Sony announced that it would be creating a new eco-friendly paper material for its packaging, made from bamboo, sugarcane, and post-consumer recycled paper. Canon By 2050, Canon aims to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions \u2014 and that\u2019s just the start of the brand\u2019s lofty eco-friendly goals. Canon offers a variety of recycling programs to ensure customers have an easy way to recycle their products. This includes consumer products, ink cartridge recycling, and more. Additionally, Canon created an innovative and environmentally conscious array of toner products to curb hazardous substances while reducing plastic waste. Canon also has a robust array of biodiversity programs aimed at curbing climate change and preserving the natural environment. This includes tree plantings, bird monitoring, support of national parks like Yellowstone, and Canon Canada\u2019s Branch Out program, which lets employees at all levels create new green spaces in their local communities. Microsoft Microsoft made waves in the sustainable-tech movement when it launched its Ocean Plastic Mouse in 2021. The shell of the mouse is made with a groundbreaking 20 percent recycled ocean plastic. That\u2019s plastic waste collected from the oceans and waterways that\u2019s cleaned, processed into recycled resin pellets, blended, and turned into the Ocean Plastic Mouse. This is a big win for the world\u2019s at-risk waterways. Beyond this mouse, Microsoft invites customers to send in their old products instead of throwing them away. Plus, it offers 100 percent recyclable packaging with a box that\u2019s plastic-free and created from recyclable sugarcane natural fibers and recyclable wood. Nikon Nikon is another technology company cutting carbon emissions. In fact, Nikon plans to reduce its own emissions to \u201cvirtually zero\u201d by 2050. Given the dire state of climate change, Nikon also updated its policies in 2021 with new greenhouse gas reduction targets. The new goal? Cut greenhouse gas emissions at Nikon facilities by 71.4 percent by March 2031. Other moves Nikon is making to do its part for the planet include reducing water withdrawal at its facilities, cutting waste generation, creating guidelines to ensure hazardous chemical substances stay out of the environment, and more. Nikon also provides its devices to researchers in the medical and life sciences fields to aid groundbreaking research. Fujifilm Fujifilm\u2019s mission to reduce CO2 emissions by 50 percent \u201cacross the entire product life cycle\u201d by 2030 proves its dedication to saving the environment. The brand hopes to convert at least 50 percent of purchased electric power to renewable energy by 2030, andreduce water use by 30 percent by 2030 as well. Those are just a few of Fujifilm\u2019s environmental vows, which also include waste reduction and minimizing chemicals that enter our environment. Perhaps one of the brand\u2019s biggest milestones is its introduction of the \u201cGreen Value Products\u201d certification program. This initiative includes certification criteria to evaluate the environmentally conscious design of each product. It\u2019s implemented not just by Fujifilm, but by third-party experts to guarantee utmost objectivity and transparency. So far, it has 166 certified products in this range. (View the list here.) Lowepro Technology brands aren\u2019t the only ones helping creators make greener purchases. Camera-bag powerhouse Lowepro offers its own array of packs created with recycled materials: the PhotoSport III sustainable adventure backpack series. This green line is made with 75 percent recycled materials. The lining, insert, and AW cover are made of 100 percent recycled materials, while the outer shell is 50 percent recycled. Peak Design Peak Design, known for everything from tripods to bags and accessories, is another creative industry brand breaking the mold to protect the environment. The brand cofounded Climate Neutral, a nonprofit designed to help businesses accurately measure \u2014 then offset and reduce \u2014 their carbon footprint. They also practice what they preach by offsetting the entirety of their own carbon footprint from resource extraction to finished product delivery. To guarantee full transparency, they hired third-party experts to calculate these emissions. Additionally, Peak Design prioritizes eco-friendly materials. The main fabric for their bags is 100 percent post-consumer recycled polyester and 100 percent post-industrial recycled nylon. Also, they\u2019ve used the equivalent of three million water bottles of recycled plastic for their bags\u2019 outer fabric \u2014 with a variety of other important recycling strategies fully integrated into their business process. Pacsafe Pacsafe is yet another creative industry accessory brand hoping to pay it forward for the planet. The company has pledged to remove all virgin plastic from their supply chain by 2025. In the meantime, they\u2019re also helping the planet via donations to important causes. For one, Pacsafe donates one percent of all website sales to turtle conservation. Funds to the Pacsafe Turtle Fund \u2014 launched in 2014 \u2014 have created a sea turtle rescue and education center that focuses on treating injured turtles while educating local communities. Pacsafe is also collaborating with the Ecosystem Impact Foundation to preserve and protect some of the last remaining islands off the northwest coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Adding to its environmental goals, Pacsafe hosts beach clean-ups to raise awareness about the negative effects of single-use plastics as well.

Personal care and beauty is a $51 billion industry that's growing 5.4%, according to Alice Mintz\u200b, director of integrated solutions at DAAP, a SPINS subsidiary. Natural, in particular, is driving 21% of beauty's growth, which is an overcontribution relative to its 8% industry share. Industry experts shared data, trends and more during \"The State of Natural Beauty\" panel discussion at Expo West. Brands are also making a conscious effort to market products for all. Beauty, particularly in the natural space, is becoming more inclusive regarding gender, race, age, socio-economics and skin type, increasing accessibility for all. Many consumers look to natural and specialty retailers to stock clean beauty products. Jocelyn Lyle\u200b, senior vice president of development and partnerships at Environmental Working Group (EWG), shares that 75% of Americans believe toxic chemicals in personal care products are a severe threat, according to a recent EWG poll. That number increases to 84% among women under 50. EWG also found that 71% of household purchasers prefer to shop for personal care in-store instead of online. \u200b Social media platforms such as TikTok and expanded online resources make consumers more educated than ever. As a result, there is a purchase influence cycle where a consumer will learn about a product and the effects of a particular ingredient, which drives them to the store to test a product and look closely at the ingredient list for themselves. Consumers know what desired results to expect. Efficacy and transparency will be key to getting a product off the shelf and integrating it into their routine. As Mintz predicts, \"Natural will transform the beauty industry at a faster rate than we experienced with food and beverage.\" On the left, you can see that ACURE utilizes TikTok to demonstrate how to use its new sustainable powdered mask and the ingredients behind it. Cultural forces are driving the trends outlined below. Each trend is a response to society's desire for holistic health and well-being, purpose-driven innovation and to meet modern life. Skincare as makeup\u200b One of the beauty trends New Hope Network is seeing is the barefaced look and coquette makeup\u2014think romantic with light pink shades, softly blended and a dewy, luminous look. These looks are light and require only a few products. Simplicity is essential, and when wearing makeup, people want it to do more and be beneficial. Hybrid products such as Mineral Fusion's 2-in-1 Lip & Cheek Stain help simplify a routine and ease paring down the number of products in one's bag. The brand's Sheer Moisture Lip Tint provides a beautiful color with benefits. It hydrates and firms from ingredients such as shea butter and peptides. Another example is Babo Botanicals' Daily Sheer Fluid Tinted Mineral Sunscreen can also be used as a primer base. It is lightly tinted, suitable for multiple skin tones and hydrating. The ingredient list contains upcycled passion fruit seed oil sourced from a family-owned farm in Peru, organic raspberry oil, and sweet white lupine for blue light protection.\u200b From Pacifica's Kind Glaze, skincare meets makeup in this dewy illuminator that supports a healthy skin barrier. Ceramide NP, vegan collagen and vegan squalane all hydrate the skin and lock in moisture.\u200b Skinimalism and shortened personalized routines In addition to minimal makeup, consumers are cutting down on their skincare routines. The goal is to find a simple, personalized routine best suited to their skin needs. Many took the time to practice multi-step and intensive skincare routines during the pandemic quarantine. Now though, people are going back out and getting busier. They want a simplified routine with minimal products, hence a call back to hybrid products where they can get more out of one product instead of needing two. It is all about a return to quality over quantity. Pictured, HiBAR's solid face wash line offers different solutions based on your skin's need and specific PH balance. Shorter and cleaner ingredient list\u200bs A product does not need a complex list of ingredients to stand out. The ones with \"-less\" are making bigger impacts. The search for shorter, simpler lists and fragrance-free products continues to rise. Consumers know more about the science of certain ingredients and what works best for their own skin. They can easily sort through the noise and are paying attention to the quality of ingredients and efficacy of a product. Pictured, these products in stick formats are easy for consumers to incorporate into their routines. Both Andalou's new Dark Spot Corrector (left) and Pacifica's Wake Up Beautiful Balm (right) boost trending plant-based ingredients. Consumers are seeking more haircare options People want every part of their personal care routine covered from the tip of the toe to the top of the head. SPINS reports that natural personal care has accelerated 10% in the past year, with haircare, particularly, seeing the most significant subcategory growth at 2% compared to the past two years. In the past two years, haircare had a 3% sales increase, which was larger than the sales growth for bath and body, skincare, oral care and suncare. Pictured above from left to right: Kitsch Scalp Oil, BRIXY Solid Shampoo, Nfuse Revive Scalp Serum Sustainability Consumers are still demanding clean, safe and natural formulations but now are pushing manufacturers a step further with sustainability. They are actively looking for compostable and refillable packaging. While beauty aisles have traditionally been flooded with plastic and bulky packaging lining the shelves, natural is pushing the needle forward. Natural beauty and personal care innovators are leading in eliminating plastic and developing sustainable solutions like waterless formulas. Removing water from a product, concentrating it and ridding packaging of unnecessary plastic have been building momentum for some years. As a result, these products ship lighter, have a lower carbon footprint, preserve resources and have a smaller footprint on retail shelves. Expo West exhibitors presented new brands such as BRIXY bringing consumers more waterless, solid personal care options, allowing hydrating ingredients like coconut oil, cacao seed butter, argan oil, shea butter and provitamin B to not be diluted. Spinster Sisters Co. won the NEXTY Award for Best New Personal Care or Beauty Product with its Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Face Serum Stick. Acids continue to be a trending ingredient, with hyaluronic acid showing a 25.6% increase in attribute dollar sales over the past two years. Retinol saw a 31.9% increase, and bakuchiol sales grew 15.6%. When it comes to acids, \"Consumers are not afraid to layer, experiment and cycle,\" Mintz says. Other products shown include LastObject's LastSwab Reusable Beauty Trio, which eliminates the need for single-use cotton swabs. Each tip has a specific shape\/texture for different beauty applications in a convenient travel case. ACURE is a stalwart brand innovating and pushing for sustainable beauty with waterless formulations in paperboard packaging. Like Spinster Sisters' serum stick, ACURE's new Brightening Eye Serum Stick comes in an easy-to-apply stick format packaged in a compostable tube. Trending ingredients include plants and botanicals. According to SPINS, aloe vera, tea tree oil for hair care and colloidal oatmeal all saw significant increases in sales over the past two years. Mayo of NIQ says the trending ingredients her company is watching include kale, rose oil, antioxidants, algae, ginger, sunflower oil, dandelion, plant-based protein and acai. She also shares that products free from aluminum, phthalates and sulfate are driving significant growth in personal care sales. Education Now is the time to be sharing more with a potential purchaser. Take advantage of not only packaging to tell a brand's story but also websites and social media\u2014demonstrations on new delivery formats via social media videos and posted reviews about product efficacy are where many consumers go for discoveries. Consumers are likely to check multiple channels before purchasing a new beauty product. Design space is limited on packaging, especially for beauty, as products tend to be smaller. Above is a great diagram from Spinster Sisters Co. on the key points to include when using packaging to share a product's sustainability positioning. NIQ reported that in the last year, \"greenwashing\" ranked as the sixth most-mentioned topic by those who posted about clean ingredients on Instagram, which tells us that consumers are following up on claims and verifying that brands are taking the actions they say they are. The top five topics mentioned last year were non-toxic, natural formulations, renewable energy, conscientious and recycling, showing that clean beauty enthusiasts are very interested in sustainability claims. They want their dollars to support every step of a sustainable and ethical manufacturing process. Tips for moving forward Whether embracing one or multiple of the trends mentioned above, Mintz of SPINS shares some final advice for brands: 1. Build trust with certifications Help consumers identify products aligned with industry expectations. As Lyle of EWG points out, third-party validation matters.\u200b EWG's recent polling found that 75% of household purchasers are interested in third-party certifications.\u200b Over 50% of household purchasers use third-party certifications at least sometimes to find safer products, and 52% of millennials and Gen Z are aware of EWG VERIFIED. NIQ data shows that clean and cruelty-free are top characteristics among both younger and older generations driving their beauty purchases.

Now, it is set to become a pioneer in environmentally-safe fashion practices, as well. To celebrate Earth Day, Italian brand Golden Goose announced its progressive plan to advance its sustainability agenda and become a pioneer in the eco-friendly fashion system. The project is built on three forward-looking steps: the opening of the new Yatay Lab, the launch of its Repair services online, and the release of the company\u2019s annual Sustainability Report. The Yatay Lab, situated in Erba (Como, Italy), is the evolution of the brand\u2019s 2022 partnership with Coronet Group, a leader in the research and production of animal-free, bio-based, and recycled materials, as well as the worldwide reference point for the sustainable Made in Italy luxury Market. The encounter between the two companies was destined to be a winning move from the very beginning. Now, they collaborate toward the development of circular materials and products for reducing fashion waste and reimagining the use we make of it. Courtesy of Golden Goose \u201cSince the very first moment we felt that the synergy between Golden Goose\u2019s knowledge of its consumer and Coronet\u2019s cutting-edge technologies would play a key role in this partnership. Our Yatay Lab isn\u2019t just about creating new products. This innovation hub has the goal of becoming a pioneer for circularity and an attraction pole for worldwide sustainable dreamers who are looking for expertise and technical skills to turn their business needs into tangible solutions,\u201d Golden Goose CEO Silvio Campara said. The partnership will proceed through multiple testing phases and collections of consumer feedback, making the results public and available for all luxury players. The intent is to move forward together, building a strong network of creatives who fight for positive change. One of the partnership\u2019s biggest achievements in 2022\u2013Yatay B, a bio-based material derived from vegetable sources\u2013is now the launch pad for Golden Goose\u2019s next challenge. After having designed the YATAY Model 1B, the brand\u2019s first bio-based sneaker, and having redesigned some Golden Goose icons using Yatay B, the luxury sneaker house is now ready to further expand this product. Thanks to Yatay\u2019s cutting-edge materials, Golden Goose will release new shapes, bringing together artisanal tradition, sustainable innovation, and vision. Courtesy of Golden Goose Moreover, the brand is extending its REPAIR Service to its online platform. The idea was first seen as part of the three Forward Stores\u2013Milan, New York, and Dubai\u2013which opened in 2022. Its success was unprecedented: with a percentage of 38%, REPAIR was the top service request among Repairing, Remaking, Reselling, and Recycling. Finally, Golden Goose\u2019s commitment to transparency has led the Italian house to release the 2022 Diary, its Sustainability Report, hoping to contribute to global growth in an earth-first approach to fashion.","filter_flag":1}

It needs to be much more connected to strategic go-to-market areas, focusing sustainability efforts on financial impact and growth. The CSO should be involved in the organization at a high level in these additional areas: Business modeling: The CSO, chief innovation officer and chief digital officer must work together to bring forth state-of-the-art technology and progressive initiatives to support the sustainability agenda. Internally, this group must work together on gathering the right data to automate ESG reporting. Externally, they must bring in advanced sustainability technologies and science in the form of new business models and\/or start-ups. Competitive advantage : The CSO, CEO and the head of strategy must work together to make sure that sustainability becomes a pillar of competitive differentiation. Elevating the subject to the long-term strategic plan brings attention to the topic and makes sure it gets cascaded throughout the organization. Monetization: Sustainability cannot just be a compliance play and focused on cost. It is much more than the cost of doing business. The CSO and the head of marketing must work together to ensure that sustainability efforts are properly packaged and productized. Supported by pricing and monetization teams, they can gage the sources of revenue and profit streams from sustainable products, services and business models. They prepare the value playbook for sales so that sustainability is part of sales enablement efforts. Growth: Companies that have taken sustainability seriously derive a large amount of revenue from their efforts. Unilever, Ikea, Schneider Electric and Tesla, for example, are growing faster than others. They are riding the wave of changing consumer behaviors and perceptions toward sustainability. Unilever\u2019s Sustainable Living brands\u2014including Dove, Knorr, Omo\/Persil, Rexona\/Sure, Lipton, Hellmann\u2019s and Wall\u2019s ice cream\u2014are growing 69% faster than the rest of the business and delivering 75% of the company\u2019s growth. Customer success: Taking a leadership role in sustainability also means educating, guiding and co-developing with customers. A CSO has to sit with customers to improve their customers\u2019 success in sustainability areas and to demonstrate how their company can help. It is all about becoming a trusted advisor. Then, the next step is to quantify the realized value this brings to the customer by formally measuring the delivered impact through certifications, labels, new products, services, etc. Sustainability must be focused not only on measuring internal benefits to the firm but also concrete impact to customers. For that, sustainability must be productized, monetized and priced based on value.

We rely on the cloud and data centers in our professional and personal lives, and we look forward to the exciting developments in machine learning and AI. But all that technology demands a delicate balancing act between profit, consumer demand, and security. For a long time, the environmental impact and sustainability of computing technology has been a lesser consideration -- but that is changing. Generation Z, people born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, are contemplating what their future will look like. Older Gen Zers are already building their careers. And as they picture that future, environmental concerns loom large. A Pew Research Center Study found that 67% of people in the Gen-Z generation think that addressing climate change should be a top priority to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations. Gen Z goes by many other names: \u201cdigital natives\u201d and \u201cthe internet generation\u201d among them. Their knowledge of technology and concern for the environment could bring sustainability into the center of computing conversation. What harm does this technology do to sustainability efforts, and how can it be harnessed to do the opposite? Several experts talked to InformationWeek about the challenges that we face in the modern computing landscape and the potential solutions that could arise. Gen Z on the Environmental Impact of Computing: 'A Culture of Waste' The awareness of the environmental impact of computing technology has grown, but it is easy to understand why it has taken time. \u201cOne of the issues inherent in computing is the invisibility of the machinery that makes the magic happen, meaning that it is really easy for these impacts to go unnoticed, and it is very difficult to accurately account for these impacts even if one has a certain level of awareness,\u201d says Bran Knowles, a senior lecturer in data science at Lancaster University. Knowles was the lead author of a brief, Computing and Climate Change, for the Association for Computing Machinery. The brief explores the global energy demands of data centers (up 100% over the past 10 years) and the global emissions attributable to the information and communication technology (ICT) sector (1.8%). Carbon emissions are a part of the picture, but they do not tell the whole story of how computing technology impacts the environment. For Steven Gonzalez, a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the story is a local one. He authored a case study included in the MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC). The case study zooms in to look at individual data centers and the impact they have on the people and environment around them. Gonzalez points to the noise pollution emitted by a data center in Chandler, Ariz. He also highlights how data centers compete for local resources, like water, electricity, and land. \u201cThe server farm is no longer a metaphor. The servers are actually competing with crops for water resources,\u201d he says. Computing technology also demands rare earth metals. The mining, manufacture, and disposal of the resultant waste creates considerable environmental damage. Devices powered by computing technology also contribute to the mounting electronic waste. \u201cThe hunger for faster and better machines remains insatiable. The average lifespan for an electronic device is hardly over three years, with a few needing to be replaced within 24 months,\u201d says Durvesh Ganveer, chief architect behind the sustainability assessment framework at information technology service and consulting company NTT DATA. The engineering capabilities to make devices last longer than a handful of years exists, but planned obsolescence is a prominent business strategy. All of these environmental impacts are compounded by the incredible demand for data centers and the cloud. Downtime at data centers is incredibly costly. The technicians at data centers are tasked with keeping the cloud operational, not sustainable or efficient, according to Gonzalez. \u201cThere's a metabolism to computation. It has inputs and outputs that needs energy, and it needs water, and it needs all these materials, that it then ingests and then excretes \u2026That's something that we're confronted with. The consequences of that as we digitize even more,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see that the cloud has a culture; a culture that is very much a culture of waste.\u201d Gen Z's Search for Greener Technology Solutions to these challenges are not going to be easy to implement. \u201cWe've gotten into this \u2018bigger is better\u2019 power paradigm,\u201d notes Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist and climate lead at artificial intelligence company HuggingFace. If people have been able to make a million-parameter AI model, why not a billion-parameter one? A trillion-parameter one? \u201cOnce you've embarked on this journey, it is hard to stop.\u201d Change will have to come from many different fronts. Measurement is one of the most fundamental places to start. How can computing technology be made more sustainable if we can\u2019t quantify its impact on the environment? \u201cMore work needs to be done to develop consistent guidelines for measuring the consumption of resources and the environmental impact across industries. This is a complex task that demands collaboration between industry, private-public partnerships, governmental agencies and various stakeholders,\u201d Ganveer explains. Measuring Tech Emissions Efforts to measure computing technology\u2019s emissions and resource consumption are underway. For example, the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has released emissions targets for the ICT industry; it is calling for the ICT industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030. The European Green Digital Coalition has brought together 26 companies with plans to develop green digital solutions and tools for measuring their environmental impact. Companies can adopt standards for environmental management and become ISO 14001 certified. While these efforts are important, measurable progress in sustainability will need to be supported by regulation. \u201cI think policy also plays a role, and so far, water, power and emissions are really not priced or regulated based on environmental impact. This is changing, especially in Europe, where stricter guidelines are already coming into play,\u201d according to Krishna Subramanian, co-founder and COO of unstructured data management as a service company Komprise. Subramanian also points out the importance of incentivizing sustainability initiatives. \u201cAligning economic incentives with sustainability is required to drive the urgency of sustainable computing,\u201d she says. Roles Consumers and Companies Play in Green Tech With increasing awareness of the need for sustainable computing comes the question of responsibility. What role do consumers and companies have to play in a more sustainable future? Individual consumers cannot control the large-scale impacts of computing technology, and they most likely cannot eschew the use of that technology. But they can evaluate how they use it. \u201cI think we must start with fundamental questions. What kind of data do we want to store? For how long do we want to store? Do we need to keep all the photos of our cats and lunches on Instagram forever?\u201d asks Julia Rone, a postdoctoral researcher at the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at CRASSH, University of Cambridge. Consumers and companies can also collaborate. \u201cThe providers of computing resources can help consumers understand their carbon footprint based on their technology purchases and data usage, and likewise, consumers can demand providers use more sustainable products and services,\u201d says Ganveer. As consumer demand and regulation place more pressure on companies to prioritize sustainability, the approach to creating new products will likely change. \u201cData scientists of the future are going to need to consider climate impacts of the technologies they are creating at the beginning of, and throughout, their design process. It's no good thinking about it after the technology is already put out into the world,\u201d Knowles says. In the meantime, plenty of efforts to make current computing technology sustainable are already being made. \u201cEfficient and sustainable computing is an area where there is a lot of innovation around renewable energy, reduced heat production, better cooling technologies, more efficient storage, better data management and compute form factors and other forms of green computing,\u201d Subramanian points out. Waste may be an unavoidable byproduct of computing, but there are opportunities to repurpose waste. A UK data center startup, Deep Green, has installed a system that uses waste heat to heat a local pool, according to Datacenter Dynamics. Collaborative Thinking for a Sustainable Future This kind of collaborative thinking could be an important piece of a more sustainable future for computing. Rone is studying the democratization of digital infrastructure construction. She is focusing on how and why local groups have mobilized against the construction of a data center in North Holland. Many of the people she has interviewed aren\u2019t necessarily against the construction of data centers, but they do object to being excluded from the process. They are interested in making data centers more sustainable and minimizing the environmental impact. \u201cThere's this conflict between the logic of profit, basically, in terms of the people or companies that build the data centers and more local ideas about having them [be] more renewable,\u201d Rone explains. Embracing a more democratic approach could make a difference in many ways. Gonzalez sees promise in data storage. \u201cHow\u2026we get to the point where somebody is going to innovate a solution for data storage is going to be by democratizing and opening up, giving people access to the patents to explore and do experiments,\u201d he says. Rone sees \u201c...very interesting ideas such as collectively owned and operated clouds, collectively owned and operated social media platforms. I don't know whether this can come from the state, or it would come from social movements, but I think we need to start with the radical rethinking of our digital [world].\u201d Luccioni describes how making AI and machine learning models more accessible and democratic makes it easier to recycle and reuse data. \u201cYou can take an existing model and tweak it to your purpose, and you can take the data that someone else collected and reuse it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the end, [it] really becomes climate positive.\u201d AI and machine learning undoubtedly have environmental impacts. It can take millions of GPU hours to train large AI models, according to Luccioni. But this technology can also be put to work to better understand climate change and sustainability. \u201cMost people who are doing machine learning now are quite young, and I do see, for example, climate change AI has grown immensely in the last couple of years,\u201d she says. But she does not yet consider this use of AI to be mainstream. \u201cI feel like we've got a divide between mainstream AI research, which is really focused on performance and scale,\u201d Luccioni says. \u201cThen there's another kind of an alternative path of people who are really trying to use AI for detecting methane leaks or tracking deforestation or monitoring biodiversity.\u201d Another potential path to sustainability is through the development of alternative technologies. Gonzalez points to projects like Grow Your Own Cloud, which is exploring ways to store data in the DNA of plants. A New (Greener) Generation The challenges and potential paths to more sustainable computing are myriad. Gen Z has their work cut out for them, but it is already possible to see how their focus on sustainability could cause significant shifts in consumer and company behavior. \u201cMajors like environmental science, sustainable engineering, and data science are gaining prominence. We are getting a workforce that not only understands the urgency of the problem but is also better equipped to innovate in this area,\u201d says Subramanian. This generation\u2019s environmental concerns could also play a role in shaping policy. Maxwell Alejandro Frost was elected as the US representative for Florida\u2019s 10th congressional district, becoming the first Gen-Z member of Congress. He cited the climate crisis as one of his motivations for running, according to Inside Climate News. With environmental concerns helping to shape Gen Z\u2019s education and career choices, they are being pickier about what companies they want on their resumes. A survey from recruitment platform Handshake found some telling trends among Gen Z. A total of 65% of survey respondents reported they would be more likely to apply to a company committed to sustainable practices, and 60% reported avoiding employers perceived to have a negative impact on the environment. Rone also notes that employee activism is on the rise. She indicates the trend of employees mobilizing to demand companies become more environmentally friendly. For example, in 2019, more than 1,800 Amazon workers protested their employer\u2019s lack of action regarding climate change, CNN reported. Gonzalez describes the importance of shifting expectations as consumers in order to increase sustainability, and Gen Z may be leading the charge there. The State of Consumer Spending: Gen Z Shoppers Demand Sustainable Retail report from consumer engagement solutions company First Insight found that 62% of Gen-Z consumers prefer to buy from sustainable brands. Additionally, 73% of Gen-Z respondents are willing to pay more for sustainable products. Gen Z\u2019s dollars could be going to more than just sustainable products. They could also be putting their money to work in sustainable investments. A survey from impact investment service Inyova found that 72% of Gen Zers hope that responsible investment could drive sustainability outcomes. Iu Ayala, CEO and founder of data science consultancy Gradient insight, points out that there are more means becoming available to support that aim. \u201cThe growing interest in sustainable investing has also led to the emergence of new tools and platforms that help investors assess the environmental impact of their investments.\u201d Sustainability is top-of-mind for Gen Zers, and some of them are finding ways to bring that focus to careers in data science. Ayala believes that younger data scientists bring a fresh perspective to their field. \u201cTheir holistic approach to problem-solving, which considers social, economic and political factors, can help address the complex, interconnected nature of environmental challenges,\u201d he says.

By obfuscating and compartmentalising the process of production and distribution, the status quo distances the supplier from the environmental costs of the product. Until this model changes, it is very difficult to embed circular practices across the industry. \u201cWe also need to invest much more heavily in material science, in order to accelerate the transition to recycled materials and diverted waste streams. Collaboration will be key to this \u2013 as we have learned with the production of our bioplastic accessory collection bFRIENDS, designed by PearsonLloyd and manufactured by Batch.Works for Bene. I believe that this sort of entrepreneurial, material-led product development is likely to be the most viable route to a truly sustainable industry.\u201d Born Ugly CEO Sarah Dear \u201cWe get those daily briefs for new designs, new packs, new products. The search for \u2018new\u2019 is a hungry beast and it needs feeding taking time, money and resources, using energy and creating waste. But this effort is often wasted. New is risky: 11 out of 12 start-ups fail as do 19 out of 20 new products. incremental newness delivers diminishing returns because \u2018more\u2019 creates clutter and confusion for customers. But there\u2019s a better way. Don\u2019t just accept briefs that ask for more stuff, let\u2019s invest our time in thinking if there is a better way to solve the challenge, is it better to do less rather than more, to consolidate what a brand stands for at its core? And we need to consider the impact of our ideas. What could we do differently to impact the planet less? A website that uses less energy, a phone that uses any phone charger, a pack that\u2019s easily deconstructed. This should be our focus and what we have to invest is our time, our integrity and our understanding of how something we create lives in the world and the mark it leaves. As an industry we need fewer, better, more meaningful ideas that make real positive change.\u201d TAKT CEO and founder Henrik Taudorf Lorensen \u201cIn recent years, the design industry has focused on new materials and manufacturing processes in a drive to become more sustainable. There is no doubt that investments in these areas are important, but we must not lose sight of low-energy circular economy principles that prioritise elimination of waste and circulation of existing products for reuse and longevity. \u201cWe believe that furniture is not disposable. It should be loved, cared for and handed down to future generations. To achieve this, there must be more investment in design for repair, and business models that allow customers to buy spare parts. Within TAKT we have committed to a new policy of Perpetual Sustainable Design, that ensures all our products are designed with a component-based approach. When something inevitably goes wrong, we provide our customers with spare parts so that their furniture could last forever. We must break the unhealthy throwaway culture in our industry.\u201d SketchUp senior product marketing manager Sumele Adelana \u201cIn collaboration with technology firms, respected industry leaders and the government, funding could go towards launching competitions that drive sustainable design thinking, while also allowing professionals to win high-profile project commissions, prize money or similar high-value rewards \u2013 alongside recognition. This can help generate conversation, drive awareness across the industry and showcase innovative ways for designers to integrate sustainability. Investment could also go behind sustainability awareness programmes for higher education students. The industry should educate future interior architects and designers on how their material, lighting and furniture specifications can impact energy use and embodied carbon. Not only will this help the planet, but it will also arm them with a unique differentiator within a highly competitive market. Young students, in turn, need to be sensitized to the cause and effect of sustainable design on communities. K-12 students can grasp fundamental concepts quickly and will immediately apply them. Equipping them with age-appropriate content and technology could help consolidate and build upon this foundation.\u201d Morrama associate director Andy Trewin Hutt \u201cBetter packaging design, including refillable packaging, is a critical area that requires investment within the industry to achieve sustainability goals by 2030. Refillable packaging could be a sustainable solution that requires designing packaging that can be reused multiple times, reducing the need for single-use packaging. Durable and sustainable materials such as glass, aluminium, or high-quality plastics are often used for refillable packaging. Sustainable packaging design can also incorporate other less impactful features such as biodegradable or compostable materials, recycled content, and reduced packaging materials. It has gained popularity in recent years, and it\u2019s breaking into the cosmetics space with brands like Wild and KANKAN. Minimalistic packaging designs that eliminate unnecessary layers or components can reduce waste and the overall environmental footprint of the product, contributing to a more sustainable future. A focus should be on what happens to the refill element and if it will make it to the desired \u201cend of life\u201d. Many options do not. This is a system change that can be dictated at a government level or from a value perspective of the waste stream business. Our project for Wagamama took note of packaging taxes during the design process for this very reason.\u201d COLLINS chief strategy officer Taamy Amaize \u201cIt may seem surprising to expect the brand, advertising, and marketing industry to meaningfully influence the UN\u2019s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. To some, we merely work on behalf of, and in consultative partnership with global brands. We are often viewed simply as conduits for change rather than the actors directly effecting it. But it is also true that our industry wields much influence. We occupy the privileged position of advisors to the most powerful business leaders on the planet. So it is our responsibility to bring forth a diverse and wide-ranging set of advisors because the talent we employ as an industry is our actual product. It is also our most valuable resource. It\u2019s through that talent that world-changing ideas emerge. Where we source that talent \u2014 the people, the places, the backgrounds and perspectives \u2014 can and should be seen through the lens of reducing inequality. One of the UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce inequality within and among countries. How might our industry challenge itself to do so through our hiring practices? How might we uncover and elevate obscured talent by re-examining our own industry stereotypes? To shift the mindset from \u201cculture-fit\u201d to \u201cculture-contributor.\u201d A broader sourcing of talent was one of the few good things to come from the pandemic. We can fuel this new behaviour by changing how we view and staff our own companies. Not only will this ensure wider, more representative perspectives for our clients, but we will raise the voices, and the trajectories of people in our industry who have for years been underrepresented and truthfully, overlooked.\u201d Banner image credit: Romolo Tavani on Shutterstock","filter_flag":1}

These products offer convenient solutions focused on soil quality and water use efficiency, and field tests demonstrate consistent results to support sustainable efforts while also increasing yield. The product Enertia is an enzyme-based seed treatment for soybean, built with the patented VersaShield Formulation Technology to establish an effective rooting structure and promote nutrient cycling throughout the season. In addition, Resgenix is a water management tool developed to help farmers produce more bushels per acre with less water. Shortly after these products were unveiled, brand and crop specialists at Helena Agri-Enterprises were featured on The Helena FieldLink podcast to share details, and brand managers spoke with Farm Press to lend additional insight. Enertia for improved root structure Enertia is a seed treatment specifically designed for soybean. The protected enzyme technology works to prepare the soil around the seedling early in the season, while it establishes a strong root system to take up nutrients during germination. Although Enertia is a new product, the enzyme technology was not born overnight. It is an extension of the VersaShield Formulation Technology that goes back to 2014, invented and patented by scientists at the University of Missouri. An exclusive license allows Helena Agri-Enterprises to use the patented VersaShield Formulation Technology for soil amendment and seed treatment, and Helena has utilized this technology in the product Zypro since 2019. With the Enertia seed treatment, farmers get the same results they would out of a biological \u2013 but with increased protection and usability. From a handling standpoint, the enzyme technology in Enertia takes the worry out of keeping the microbe alive in the jug or in the tank mix, and the product goes directly onto the seed and activates immediately in the soil. Enertia can be mixed right into the slurry at a low use rate with any soybean seed treatment system that a farmer already has in place. Mike Powell, senior brand manager and crop production lead, described the ultra-easy use. \u201cThe big thing with VersaShield Formulation Technology enzymes is that they are protected. You can use them a lot like chemistry. They can go into a mix, and they fit the way a farmer is farming today without the worry of water chlorination or soil pH. \u201cIf you are putting it out with a fungicide or insecticide, you can put it in the tank with confidence and know that when it gets to the soil, it will go to work providing the benefits,\u201d he said. In addition to convenience, the product is also consistent. Aaron Hert, research and development manager, reported the findings from a 12-location study in 2022 across the Midwest and the South. Enertia produced more than a 14% increase in root weight by growth mass, leading to a 2.4 bushel per acre yield advantage over the standard treatments alone. \u201cWhat we have seen in our testing is pretty dramatic,\u201d Hert said. \u201cIt is the response from those enzymes going to work in the soil and setting up that plant during germination to establish root structure and take up nutrition early in the season.\u201d Powell added that Enertia is a low-cost investment, and the yield increase provides the farmer with a big return. \u201cIf you do the math on the testing that we did, the 2.4-bushel increase is over an eight to one return on a farmer\u2019s investment for just putting Enertia on the seed.\u201d Enertia will launch with full availability in 2024, but there is a chance to preview the technology in 2023. To encourage familiarity, Powell said a limited supply is available at approximately 45 Helena locations across the country under the experimental number HM 2163. Farmers interested should contact their Helena representatives for information on local trials. \u201cObviously the demand is bigger than we can supply the product today. This limited availability sets the stage for the 2024 growing season to get some people talking about it so that everybody can get ahold of this next year that wants it,\u201d he said. Resgenix for water use efficiency Another product launched by Helena Agri-Enterprises is Resgenix. This water management tool has been pioneered since 2019, and the improved product is fully available for the 2023 growing season. The technology in Resgenix works to promote uniform water absorption through the soil profile. This not only decreases standing water but is also targeted at sustainability to reduce runoff and control soil erosion. Austin Anderson, brand manager, said Resgenix provides compatibility and flexibility to help growers do more with less water. Unlike water management tools of the past, no special equipment or additional trips across the field are required for the application. \u201cResgenix has really given us the chance to bring these water management tools into the 21st century. We are seeing a wide range of flexibility that separates us from where we have been in the past. It has a really good fit across every farming operation no matter what sort of crops you are growing or the cultural practices you have,\u201d he said. Use of Resgenix is intended as a program approach. It can be applied up to three times per year, by way of any irrigation method, and the more you use it, the more effective it is to increase the water holding capacity in the soil. It can also be applied on dryland acres, mixed in the tank with burndown, layby, or end of season applications. As Resgenix builds up in the soil profile, farmers can maximize production across the whole farm and take advantage of rainfall and soil moisture for longer periods of time. Anderson noted this also takes the pressure off the much-needed rainfall at the end of the season when farmers are trying to gain those extra bushels. In addition, Resgenix is ideal for growers facing water use restrictions and irrigation challenges. Technical development manager, Nick Hurdle said, \u201cWe are in a situation where growers are under tight restrictions when it comes to water or how farmers are doing their job. This is an opportunity for us to be conscious of our resources that we have and get the most from them.\u201d Field tests have proven the effectiveness of Resgenix. Anderson reported experiments comparing standard grower irrigation techniques to an application of one gallon of Resgenix per acre. In these findings, Resgenix reduced water use by 20%, and after two weeks the Resgenix treated soil held more water compared to the soil alone. More soil moisture fosters greater nutrient uptake and a healthier plant. Hurdle contributed the two to three bushel per acre yield increase in these studies to increased soil water availability helping with photosynthesis, sugar transports, and other physiological processes. These same correlations are evident in other tested environments, including turf playing surfaces like golf and baseball. When it comes to these situations, standing water is never good.

On April 6, L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed a three-year deal with the Chinese ecommerce giant to establish low-carbon standards, develop new products, and create measurable circular economy solutions, according to Alibaba\u2019s news site Alizila. Additionally, the two industry leaders will work together to clean up the beauty sector\u2019s supply chain \u2014 which covers warehousing, packaging, distribution and recycling \u2014 and to increase consumer education on sustainable lifestyles. The agreement comes after L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed a deal with Alibaba in 2018 to use environmentally friendly packaging for all its products sold in China. The Jing Take Both L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Alibaba have taken steps over the years to reduce their carbon footprint. In 2019, L\u2019Or\u00e9al achieved carbon-neutrality across its operation sites in China and has since launched a number of localized campaigns to raise awareness around sustainable consumption. Meanwhile, Alibaba has pledged to go carbon neutral by 2030 and facilitate 1.5 gigatons of decarbonization by 2035, supported by initiatives like its carbon ledger whereby consumers can earn points for making low-carbon choices. While these steps are commendable, it\u2019ll take a lot more to address beauty\u2019s glaring sustainability problem. The global beauty industry produces an estimated 120 billion units of packaging annually \u2014 most of which is not recyclable \u2014 and this packaging accounts for 70 percent of the industry\u2019s waste. This has a ripple effect on our oceans, forests, and even our bodies as microplastics end up in the food we consume. But tackling the issue is not just a matter of ethics; it\u2019s also a promising business opportunity. As awareness around climate change grows, so too does the demand for green products. According to a 2022 PWC survey, 50 percent of Chinese respondents said they are willing to pay a higher than average price for a product that has a traceable and transparent origin, while 45 percent are willing to do so for products made from recycled or eco-friendly materials. \u201cIn general, the willingness of Chinese consumers to pay more for ESG-friendly products is driven by the search for \u2018better-for-me\u2019 products \u2014 whether they are produced from a better source or made from materials that contain less \u2018harmful\u2019 materials to human,\u201d states the report. Ultimately, zero waste measures can only be accomplished when a product is eliminated entirely, which is an unrealistic expectation as companies vie for China\u2019s 88 billion beauty and personal care market. Perhaps making products more sustainably and strengthening public education around the concept, like what L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Alibaba hope to do, is the next best step.

Even as we live in a consumer-driven world, with a growing appetite for new things, if we begin to look at the waste created by this level of consumption in a different light, we might turn our problem into an opportunity. Credit Flickr What is recycling? Every day, we produce a vast amount of waste that ends up in landfills or polluting our oceans. From plastic bottles to food packaging, our throwaway culture is taking a toll on the environment. Recycling is one of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills and to mitigate the negative impact on the planet. Whether it\u2019s plastic, paper, or aluminum, the products, and materials that can be used after they fulfill their original purpose are far from worthless. In fact, most materials have great recycling value. The EPA estimates that up to 75% of all the waste can be recycled or repurposed, a figure that shows how impactful the process can be if done right. Almost everything we see around us can be technically recycled, although different materials require different techniques when they are recycled. Most of the commonly recyclable materials include batteries, biodegradable waste, clothing, electronics, garments, glass, metals, paper, plastics, and a lot more. Recycling is the process of separating, collecting, and remanufacturing or converting used or waste products into new materials. But if we want to truly focus on recycling, it\u2019s important to change the way we address it both on a personal and societal level. Recycling helps extend the life and usefulness of something that has already served its initial purpose by returning it to its raw materials and then using those materials to produce something that is usable. It\u2019s part of the three golden rules of sustainability (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) and has a lot of benefits both to us humans and to the environment. Virtually all of the environment is impacted by how much we recycle. Benefits of recycling The world\u2019s natural resources are finite, and some are in very short supply. At a fundamental level, recycling paper and wood can save trees and forests, recycling plastic means creating less new polluting plastic, recycling metals means there\u2019s less need for hugely costly mining, and recycling glass reduces the use of new raw materials like sand that affect coastal systems. Of course, the reality of it is much more complex, but the fundamental process is valid nonetheless. Some materials are technically recyclable, but doing so is so expensive it virtually never happens, while other materials retain their properties better than others. Metals, for instance, are repeatedly recyclable, while maintaining most or all of their properties. The most obvious benefit of recycling is the reduction of landfill waste. Landfills are rapidly filling up, and many cities are struggling to find new places to dump their trash. Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfills, making it a vital solution to the problem of overflowing landfills. When we recycle, we give new life to materials that would otherwise end up in a landfill. Recycling reduces the need to grow, harvest, or extract new raw materials from the Earth. That, in turn, reduces the harmful disruption and damage being done to the natural world, which means fewer forests cut down, rivers diverted, wild animals harmed or displaced, and less pollution. It\u2019s also much better to recycle existing products than to damage someone else\u2019s community or land during the exploration and exploitation of new raw materials. The demand for new goods has led to more of the poorest and most vulnerable people being displaced from their homes or otherwise exploited. Making products from recycled materials typically requires less energy than making them from new raw materials \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s a huge difference in energy. For example, producing new aluminum from old products uses 95% less energy than making it from scratch. For steel, the energy saving is around 70%. Recycling paper saves 60% of the energy required to produce new paper from wood pulp. By conserving energy, we reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the production process. While not always, manufacturing something the second time around usually consumes far less energy. Because recycling means you need to use less energy on sourcing and processing new raw materials, it produces lower carbon emissions, which means it can help with global warming. It also keeps potentially methane-releasing waste out of landfill sites. Overall, reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere is vital to stop climate change. Recycling also makes economic sense. As a rule of thumb, it\u2019s six times cheaper to dispose of recycled waste than general refuse. So, the more you recycle, and the less you put in the bin, the more money is saved \u2014 which should be good for households, businesses, and local public services. Recycling food waste and green waste is a great idea too, often generating lots of valuable compost. Recycling can stimulate the economy in multiple ways. The EPA has shown recycling helps to create jobs in both the recycling and manufacturing industries. Recycling companies need workers to collect, sort, and process materials. These jobs can range from manual labor to high-tech positions, providing employment opportunities for people with different levels of education and skill. A 2016 study said recycling activities account in a single year for 757,000 jobs, $36.6 billion in wages, and $6.7 billion in tax revenues. Recycling also helps protect wildlife. When we dispose of waste improperly, it can end up in our oceans and harm marine life. For example, plastic waste can entangle and suffocate sea turtles and other animals. By recycling, we reduce the amount of waste that ends up in our oceans and protect marine life. The steps of recycling Recycling includes three essential steps, which create a continuous loop, represented by the familiar recycling symbol. The first one is to actually collect the recyclables, which can be done in different ways. For example, they can be collected from the curbside, dropped off at centers, or gathered through deposit or refund programs. Following the collection, recyclables are sent to a recovery facility where they are sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing. Recyclables are then bought and sold just like raw materials would be, and prices go up and down depending on supply and demand. A growing number of products are being manufactured with recycled content. Common household items that contain recycled materials are newspapers, steel cans, plastic laundry detergents, and soft drink containers. Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in asphalt to pave roads. Consumers can help close the recycling loop by buying new products made from recycled materials. There are thousands of products that contain recycled content. When you go shopping, look for products that can be easily recycled and products that contain recycled content. Types of recycled materials It\u2019s important to recycle any materials possible, but one of the most relevant is plastic as it is such a big part of the solid waste that we make. When plastic is sent to a landfill, it does not break down as it\u2019s not biodegradable, and even in ocean water, plastic stays around virtually forever, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces called microplastics. Most plastics are used only once before they are discarded, known as single-use plastics \u2014 this type of single-use plastic is already being banned in many parts of the world. Recycling metal is also very important as it saves energy, reduces emissions, and creates jobs. Using recycled metal, known as scrap metal, instead of new metal reduces mining waste by 97% and saves more than 90% on energy, depending on the material. Recycling metals creates six times more jobs than sending the metals to a landfill. The same applies to paper recycling. One ton of recycled paper saves 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water. It also saves energy, about 4,000 kilowatts of it, enough t power an average American home for six months. Paper takes up a lot of space in landfills, so the more is recycled the better the landfills operate. Like paper, cardboard recycling uses less water, cuts back on emissions, saves prime real estate in landfills for materials that are not recyclable, and prevents deforestation. It is estimated that recycling one ton of cardboard can save 17 trees from harm, and 7,000 gallons of water. Reduce and reuse You may have heard of \u201cThe 3 R\u2019s\u201d: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. While recycling is important, the most effective way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place. Making a new product requires a lot of materials and energy and then the product has to be transported to wherever it will be sold. That means reducing and reusing are also important ways to protect the environment. Image via Wikipedia Commons Some of the ways to reduce and reuse include looking for products that use less packaging, which means less raw materials, buying reusable over disposable items, maintaining and repairing products like clothing so they don\u2019t have to be thrown away, as well as borrowing, renting or sharing items that are used infrequently like tools. Reducing our consumption should be the first step, and reusing also tends to be far more sustainable than recycling. Recycling means turning an item into raw materials which can be used again, either for the same product or a new one, while reusing means using an object as it is, without treatment. The reason why recycling is so important is that it prevents pollution, reduces the need to harvest new raw materials, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, saves money, reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, and allows products to be used to their fullest extent. Sounds like a no-brainer, eh? If our society wants to truly reach some level of sustainability, recycling needs to play a core role in that, there\u2019s just no alternative. Was this helpful?

California and New York have PFAS bans in apparel that take effect in 2025, while Maine banned PFAS in consumer products, including apparel, starting in 2030. The bans are focused on keeping this broad family of chemicals, which have been linked to cancer and other health impacts, out of new products. But that leaves a loophole for the continued sale and circulation of existing PFAS-made products in secondhand markets, at a time when buying used is only getting more popular. The used apparel industry surged to $177 billion in global sales in 2022, according to a recent report by the online resale retailer ThredUp. And sales are projected to double to $350 billion by 2027. \u201cShould we really continue reselling products that contain fundamentally hazardous chemicals?\u201d says Mike Schade, director of the environmental group Toxic-Free Future\u2019s Mind the Store program. \u201cA circular economy is going to be an utter failure if we recirculate dangerous chemicals.\u201d ThredUp ranks No. 781 in the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s database of the largest North American online retailers. Secondhand shopping and sustainability The uptick in secondhand shopping is occurring in part because customers are looking for ways to save money amid rising inflation and also to make more sustainable shopping choices. Meanwhile, companies are embracing resale, renting and other circular business models as a way to cut environmental waste and boost their own sustainability credentials. In September, Swiss athletic brand On launched a resale site; a month later, Chinese fast fashion giant Shein did as well. The high-end outdoor clothing brand Canada Goose jumped into resale this past January, followed by Hennes & Mauritz AB announcing in March that it would team up with ThredUp to sell used clothing and accessories. Restrictions on clothes with PFAS PFAS chemicals are used in a range of products, including textiles, cosmetics and firefighting foam. From disposing of industrial waste to doing a load of laundry, there are a number of ways these substances find their way into the environment. And once they\u2019re there, PFAS can persist in water and soil for long periods of time, earning them the nickname \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d A wave of restrictions are coming online to limit PFAS in some or all applications. The restrictions focus on getting forever chemicals out of industrial supply chains for good. The emphasis has been on \u201cturning off the tap\u201d of PFAS, says Yiliqi, a scientist and project manager at the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, who goes by one name. advertisement Schade says he hopes there will be more attention on getting PFAS out of legacy products as well. But dealing with PFAS in existing products isn\u2019t easy. \u201cOnce it\u2019s in the clothing, it\u2019s really hard for us to tell or deal with it,\u201d Yiliqi says. Her advice is for people to avoid, where possible, new and used products that they know have PFAS. There isn\u2019t always an explicit label that says \u201cPFAS-free\u201d or something similar. In such cases, she assumes descriptions about water- and stain-resistance likely mean these chemicals were involved. PFAS in the fashion world It\u2019s unclear who in the fashion world is thinking about PFAS and secondhand sustainability. Even companies leading the way in both clearing forever chemicals from their supply chain and offering secondhand products were silent on the overlap. Patagonia Inc. and North Face\u2019s parent company VF Corp. declined to comment. Both of them have taken steps to remove PFAS from their supply chains and both of offer resale options. Canada Goose Holdings Inc., another retailer phasing out PFAS and new to resale, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. When asked about PFAS chemicals, ThredUp co-founder and CEO James Reinhart said he wasn\u2019t familiar. \u201cI will look it up,\u201d he told Bloomberg Green. advertisement Maxine B\u00e9dat says the issue has yet to gain much traction within the circularity community. B\u00e9dat is the founder and director of fashion-focused think tank the New Standard Institute. \u201cAs we attempt to transition into a better place, a just society, or whatever term we\u2019re giving it, it\u2019s not going to be a clean transition,\u201d she says. She notes the impracticality of suggesting everyone simply get rid of their clothes and start over. \u201cThere will be challenges along the way, and right now there\u2019s no easy solution here.\u201d Sign up Stay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

The German-owned discount grocer, which first put down roots in the United States back in 1976, is now the third-largest grocer in the country by store count, with a current total of 2,285 stores. One big reason that ALDI has become the fastest-growing grocer in the United States over the past year is inflation \u2014 penny-pinching shoppers love its value proposition. But another big reason for ALDI\u2019s unstoppable rise has been the retailer\u2019s sustainability commitments. ALDI hasn\u2019t offered single-use plastic shopping bags for more than four decades and has always encouraged shoppers to bring their own reusable bags. Further, the company has pledged to remove all plastic shopping bags from its stores by the end of 2023, an initiative that is estimated to remove 4,400 tons of plastic from circulation every year. ALDI has also committed to diverting 90% of operational waste by 2025, and to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030. To accomplish this, the grocer has rolled out nonfood donation programs to nearly all stores and distribution centers, expanded recycling and food recovery initiatives, and piloted and expanded composting. The company is also remodeling and building stores and distribution centers with sustainability top of mind. It has installed rooftop solar panels on more than 155 stores and 14 distribution centers, and has plans to continue adding them to even more stores to increase its use of green energy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s GreenChill program has recognized ALDI as a grocery industry leader for reducing harmful refrigerant emissions. Further, in its supply chain, the retailer is working with its business partners to promote sustainable sourcing. \u201cShoppers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between doing what\u2019s right and saving money,\u201d says Joan Kavanaugh, VP of national buying at Batavia, Ill.-based ALDI U.S. \u201cThat\u2019s why we make sure they don\u2019t have to. We keep sustainability in mind with everything we do, from our smaller-footprint stores to our curated selection of private label products. Our customers can feel good about their purchases without straining their budgets. As a leader in the industry, we have paved the way with aggressive goals to reduce our carbon footprint, rethink our product packaging, advocate with suppliers for ethical sourcing, and support the health and welfare of our communities. Every day, ALDI is taking actionable steps to advance our sustainability goals, and we won\u2019t stop until we\u2019ve achieved our vision to make sustainable shopping affordable for everyone.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory partner Valeriy Dokshukin said: \u201cESG cannot succeed as a siloed business function.

STMicroelectronics has released its annual sustainability report detailing 2022 performance, strategy, and ongoing action plans. \u201cWe provide our customers with the key enabling products and technologies for decarbonization and a more sustainable society through digitalization and electrification. We are committed to doing so through a secure and responsible supply chain that prioritizes our people and the planet,\u201d said Jean Marc Chery, President and CEO, STMicroelectronics. \u201cOur strong commitment to sustainability is clear from the important progress we are making in all areas and from our ambition to drive further improvement to achieve all our sustainability goals, including our goal to be carbon neutral by 2027.\u201d The identification of ST\u2019s priority sustainability topics is formalized through a regular multistakeholder materiality exercise and the company\u2019s reporting is aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality, and completeness. ST\u2019s performance across many areas was recognized again by multiple ESG rankings, indices and international certifications including, among others, Dow Jones Sustainability Index World and Europe, EuroNext VIGEO Europe 120, FTSE4Good, ISS ESG Corporate Rating and MSCI. ST\u2019s 2022 ESG achievements and progress include: Sustainable Technology ST technologies and products enable its customers to boost sustainability and seize opportunities\u200b with continued improvement of the Company\u2019s social and environmental footprint at every stage of the product lifecycle (Sustainable technology). In 2022: 77% of new products were identified as responsible (responsible sourcing, eco-design, advanced EHS standards of manufacturing, responsible products, and applications) (vs 69% in 2021); and 23% of total revenue derived from responsible products (vs 20% in 2021). Sustainable Way ST is on track to become carbon neutral by 2027 (Energy and climate change) and, while continuing to expand manufacturing capacity, actively worked in 2022 to further reduce its environmental footprint, including the following achievements: a 40% decrease in GHG emissions for scopes 1 and 2 since 2018 in absolute terms (vs a 34% decrease in 2021); an increased sourcing of electricity coming from renewable sources to 62% (from 51% in 2021); and the reuse, recovery, or recycling of 95% of the Company\u2019s waste (vs 90% in 2021), reaching the 2025 target ahead of time. ST also continued to put people first, with actions and training to support a more diverse and inclusive culture, along with continued progress on health and safety, and talent attraction and engagement, including the following achievements: \u2022 Sustainability performance is now part of the incentive program for over 21,000 employees. \u2022 Over 19,000 employees trained in 2022 on the new leadership model designed to support the transformation journey of the company. \u2022 86% of employees recommend ST as a great place to work (+3 points vs 2021) (Talent attraction and engagement). \u2022 A further decrease in the recordable case rate for employees (work-related injuries per 100 employees per year) to 0.10 (from 0.12 in 2021), a best-in-class performance. \u2022 Reached the target of hiring 30% women for exempt positions for the second year in a row. Sustainable Company Innovation is the driving force that fuels ST\u2019s growth and helps achieve the Company\u2019s business objectives. ST has a collaborative approach for profitable growth, working across ecosystems and communities and with academic, private, and public partners, to create market-leading products and solutions that enable the Company\u2019s customers to tackle tomorrow\u2019s challenges and fuel their future growth: \u2022 12% of net revenues (US$1.9 billion) invested in R&D to support innovation. \u2022 Involved in 186 active R&D partnerships worldwide. \u2022 More than 450 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) events and initiatives reaching over 100,000 students and teachers (Community and education). The 26th annual report contains highlights and details of ST\u2019s sustainability performance in 2022 and presents the Company\u2019s ambitions and longer-term goals in alignment with both the United Nations Global Compact Ten Principles and Sustainable Development Goals and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It is aligned with Global Reporting Standards (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Boards (SASB), and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The QR codes' unique serial numbers can handle fraud-proof rewards, assign loyalty points, and secure deposit redemptions. The printing of UV tags provides supply chain stakeholders with unique packaging lifecycle data, including where and when it was produced and the percentage of recycled material it contains, protecting against fraud. Both the visible QR codes and the \u2018hidden\u2019 UV tags pave the way for a cost-effective digital deposit return scheme. In the future, scanning the unique QR code on used product packaging could enable consumers to reclaim their deposit via their smartphones from home. Brands may also benefit from on-pack QR codes and UV tags, providing them with data to \u2018describe, tag and trace\u2019 their plastic packaging through the circular economy, while also streamlining packaging and recycling operations. The technology also allows legislators to measure business liabilities and enforce legislation by identifying plastic packaging ownership. Local authorities and recycling centers can capture real-time data on packaging composition and breakdown of bales, helping to inform recycling strategy, investment in sorting and recovery equipment and onward tracking of materials. Rob Thompson, packaging manager at Co-op, championed the initiative as a necessary enabler for a circular recycling economy for all packaging materials: \u2018The duality of the UV tag and QR code on our water bottles will enable Co-op to gain a greater understanding of a product's journey in the recycling chain and provide valuable insight to shape guidance and measurement for future initiatives to encourage more people to recycle.\u2019 Alice Rackley, CEO of Polytag, believes the combination of consumer-facing QR codes and UV tags is the future of creating and maintaining a circular economy, stating: \u2018The onus is now firmly on the industry to take responsibility for the packaging they produce. Polytag is a necessary enabler for FMCG brands committed to circularity. It is a data, sustainability and marketing platform in one, already delivering world-firsts in partnership with major brands, such as Co-op who are reaping the rewards of greater visibility of their packaging.\u2019 Rackley encouraged other brands and retailers to explore the potential of this innovative approach.","filter_flag":1}

The study revealed customers\u2019 CSR commitment, particularly in the areas of packaging, where the impact on the environment makes it a major issue for companies. According to the survey, environmental friendliness is the third most important consideration when buying packaging. Circular economy, carbon footprint and product origin are also factors. Antalis\u2019 Green Star System and Green Card makes it easier for companies to access environmental information about products as well as compare their performance against a set of criteria. The Green Star System for packaging This classification concept is a rating system grounded in a strict set of criteria (recycled material, bio sourced material, technical recyclability etc.) that is measured meticulously and consistently. Antalis Packaging\u2019s aim is that by 2025, 100% of its Master\u2019in products (own brand label) and 50% of suppliers\u2019 packaging products have an environmental rating. The Green Card This is an information concept that provides customers in-depth environmental product information. It includes multiple criteria such as recycled material, bio-sourced material, technical recyclability, reusability, GHG emissions, product certifications and origin. Designed and validated by certified environmental experts, these two initiatives provide comprehensive information on environmental products and encourage Antalis customers to select the best eco-friendly packaging solutions.","filter_flag":1}

There is so much innovation in the world of beauty, and with that comes many exciting new product launches. However, I'd be remiss to not mention the industry is not kindest to the environment and our efforts towards sustainability. Several new products and brands are launching every single day, and with overconsumption comes a colossal amount of waste. In an office discussion just this week, I shared how I often get overwhelmed with the number of new launches that land on the beauty desk each week\u2014I simply don't have enough skin or hair to test everything. And while colleagues, family and friends are very happy to test on my behalf, I'm becoming more and more selective around what I test and recommend, and how the said beauty product affects our planet, including whether it is easily recyclable. A 2018 report by Zero Waste Week found that the beauty industry produces a shocking 142 billion pieces of packaging each year. And as you'll already have noticed, it's not that easy to recycle your empty beauty products. According to The British Beauty Council, only 14% of packaging actually makes it to a recycling plant, and then only 9% is recycled\u2014the rest heads directly to landfill. As such, you'll only ever find our beauty team recommending the products they truly love and have road-tested themselves on Who What Wear. We don't recommend a product for the sake of it being new\u2014we share it because we really do rate it. In the spirit of becoming more of a minimalist in my beauty routine, (which not only does wonders for the skin\u2014raise a hand if your skin barrier has been personally victimised by a 10-step skincare routine?) I'm streamlining the products that I use. It means there is less clutter in my bathroom and dressing table, and most importantly, less waste. One way I'm doing this is by prioritising brands that offer refillable beauty products. Beauty refills are becoming more and more popular, and even the mainstream beauty brands are taking notice, and I'm here for it. Choosing refillable products is one way that you can minimise your beauty waste (versus buying a whole new bottle or compact each time you run out) and the refill is often far more cost-effective too, making it kind to the planet and your bank account. It's certainly not going to solve the wider sustainability issues, but is a small step that you can make to minimise the waste you create from new packaging when you replenish your favourite products. Ahead, you'll find some of our favourite brands who offer refills on your favourite beauty products so you can shop more sustainably. The Best Refillable Beauty Brands 1.

Berton Vineyards prides itself on being a contemporary winery with an emphasis on all that is casual, friendly and approachable in the production and distribution of top quality wine. Berton Vineyards is continuing to topple new standards of wine production in Australia. We discuss sustainability, new products and how the company has managed to bottle success with Managing Director, Jamie Bennett. BERTON DOES IT BETTER Wine has been the unassailable, most popular beverage of mankind for thousands of years. Our natural fondness for this historic drink stems from its delicious flavours, underrated nutritional properties and of course not forgetting its psychotropic and intoxicating effects when consumed in excess. No other alcoholic drink can claim to have had such a dramatic impact on society through the ages. The trade of wine between a multitude of cultures and civilisations historically opened up channels for religion and ground-breaking philosophical ideas to spread across the globe, engulfing entire regions with an enviable reputation as the new drink of choice for every occasion. In previous eras, a thriving wine industry was also the clearest indicator of a prospering nation, as only the most developed societies could support a competitive and productive wine making operation. Drawing on this rich and fruitful history, the Berton Vineyards (Berton) story began 25 years ago from the humblest of beginnings. \u201cWe are still young enough to be awed by tradition, but we also challenge ourselves by testing the boundaries of winemaking,\u201d opens Jamie Bennett, Managing Director of Berton. Fast forward to the present day, and the global wine industry is contending with a vast reduction in demand for product. This is simply due to policy decisions, an obstacle made all the more frustrating for companies as it is out of their direct control, therefore leaving them completely helpless to wrestle back any meaningful influence of the sector. \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in market forces finding their own balance but when decision makers adversely affect your opportunities it is a hard pill to swallow,\u201d describes Bennett. \u201cHowever, nearly every industry is dealing with its own problems, and what would work be without a few challenges? The most rewarding aspect of turning up each day is finding a solution,\u201d he continues. PREMIUM PRODUCTION PROCESSES Bennett has always been involved in different manufacturing industries and having grown up in rural New South Wales (NSW), there formed a natural affiliation with the land and being a producer of goods. \u201cIn my first job, I spent 10 years involved in the poultry sector until the wine industry beckoned. This is where my partnership with Robert Berton and James Ceccato began, and we have basically been tied at the hip since,\u201d he recalls fondly. Beginning operations in 2005 and now employing a team of 60 people, Berton\u2019s facilities and vineyards are located in the small town of Yenda, situated 20 kilometres northeast of Griffith, in NSW\u2019s Riverina District. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the unique combination of flat plains, a hot climate and most crucially, an ample supply of water for the irrigation of crops. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. In terms of grape intake and branded sales, the production hub is now ranked prestigiously among the top 20 Australian wineries. The winery itself was first established in 1945 and has close ties with the development of the Riverina as a major Australian viticultural area. The site now has the impressive capacity to crush and bottle approximately 20,000 tonnes of wine annually and possesses a storage capacity of 14 million litres. GROWING A BURGEONING PORTFOLIO Berton prides itself on being a contemporary winery with an emphasis on all that is casual, friendly and approachable in the production and distribution of top quality wine. \u201cOur philosophy is to make affordable, easy drinking wines of quality, achieved through the pairing of modern technology with traditional techniques,\u201d Bennett explains. Testament to this philosophy, come award winning wines such as the company\u2019s Metal Label Black Shiraz, Limited Reserve and Reserve ranges. Over the years, Berton\u2019s portfolio has received numerous accolades, including two Decanter Magazine awards for the 2014 Reserve Coonawarra Cabernet, which was named the best new world cabernet and the 2015 Reserve Shiraz, which was named the world\u2019s best value Red Rhone Varietal. \u201cWe have taken the approach of giving brands time to make their statement, and we are seeing the benefits of this approach as our brands gain traction both domestically and internationally,\u201d elaborates Bennett. Another particular point of pride for the company is its vineyard in High Eden, a sub-region of Eden Valley, which Bennett believes adds an element of prestige to the portfolio with 30 acres of premium fruit. \u201cOur iconic wine, The Bonsai, is made from the High Eden vineyard, and we are very proud of it,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI don\u2019t think we necessarily see ourselves as different to our competitors but we are about being faithful to our winemaking processes and producing a consistency of quality that our customers can trust.\u201d EXPANSION AND NEW PRODUCE The development of Berton\u2019s turf farm is a project that the company is especially satisfied with. There is a business-wide understanding of the importance of ensuring that the company\u2019s footprint is one of enhanced sustainability and every decision Berton makes must now consider its consequences for the environmental impact. Moving forward, Bennett sees great scope for expansion into new corners of the global wine landscape. \u201cIt would be particularly exciting for our business to gain entry back into the Chinese market, so hopefully we come together and patch up our differences soon. The Indian and US markets also represent great opportunities as our business moves forward,\u201d he details. Situated within a region boasting a rich Italian migrant history, comes some wonderfully unique grape varieties that Berton is only now beginning to explore. \u201cWe believe that these distinct varietals are perfectly aligned with our commitment to providing our customers with a product they can rely on every time,\u201d expands Bennett. On top of its dedication to creativity and innovation, the one overriding belief that Berton holds close to its heart is that the partnerships that it forms with suppliers need to be the foundation of the organisation. Accordingly, many of the company\u2019s suppliers and partners have a shareholding in the business. \u201cThis not only gives us great confidence about tomorrow but reaffirms the commitment we are making to each other.\u201d \u201cWe are constantly looking at ourselves to see what we can do better, because if you are not willing to improve, you will be swallowed up and become irrelevant\u201d Jamie Bennett, Managing Director, Berton Vineyards TARGETING SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION As a member of Sustainable Wine Australia, Berton places a high value on its commitment to sustainability. \u201cWe are constantly looking at ourselves to see what we can do better, because if you are not willing to improve, you will be swallowed up and become irrelevant,\u201d Bennett affirms. Throughout the entire business, the company continues to ask itself how it can reduce power, what systems it can make more efficient and what is a sustainable use for its secondary products. Through the implementation of these key questions, Berton will proceed forward rather than remaining stationary within an industry that is constantly evolving and morphing in imaginative new directions with a willingness to embrace innovation. In terms of looking after the future of the business, Berton is always eyeing fresh opportunities, and its young consumers are continually searching for new and sustainable options. Innovation and a willingness to adapt to consumer trends will help position Berton in an increasingly favourable market standing within the expansive wine making landscape. \u201cIt is incumbent upon us to meet this challenge because our goal is to introduce two to three new products to the market in the next 12 months; we aim to be a company that is prepared to not only respect the great traditions of wine, but also be flexible enough to understand what the market desires,\u201d Bennett concludes boldly.

First launched in 2021, the pledge outlines 10 goals for Greggs to help make the world a better place (see progress against each of the goals below). The commitments, aligned with the ambitions of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, are based on three key elements where the firm believes it is best placed to make a difference: building stronger, healthier communities; making the planet safer; and becoming a better business. Roisin Currie, chief executive at Greggs, said she was pleased to report that the firm is on track to achieve each of the targets outlined by 2025. \u201cAs we look to the year ahead, we are in a strong position to continue to make significant progress,\u201d she added. \u201cBy giving good food a second chance and redistributing it to those in need and reducing food waste, to implementing initiatives that directly tackle climate change, like continuing to switch to renewable energy, and ensuring we are committed to workplace diversity and inclusivity, we are driving initiatives to make the world a better place.\u201d As Greggs nears the halfway mark, it has outlined the progress against its 10 commitments as well as the next steps in its plans.

In terms of manufacturing, raw materials and pricing, how different are sustainable products from regular ones? Are there any areas where you still face challenges to make the process 100% sustainable? How did Dia Mirza get associated with the brand and how has her background helped you? Numerous companies are now being accused of greenwashing and pseudo-sustainability. What are your thoughts on that? Parents are usually extremely careful while trying out new products, especially ones which are not conventionally made. Did you face any resistance from new parents when you started out or even now? New mom, entrepreneur and sustainability enthusiast, Surbhi Bafna Gupta is the co-founder of sustainable baby care brand, Allter. Her brand found its footing in a new mother's quest for sustainable alternatives to diapers, which are the highest waste contributors to landfills. Upon finding that no existing brands were in sync with her needs, she decided to take matters in her own hands and Allter was born. The brand's products are designed to be high performing sustainable alternatives to mainstream products and are an answer to the concerns of all the new moms out there. In a chat, Surbhi tells us how she envisions her brand's journey on the sustainability path and more.I have always aspired to be an entrepreneur who creates a business that makes a positive impact, and sustainability has always been a passion for me. Diapers, a product we put so close to our baby's skin, contain high amount of chemicals and toxins, and I knew I didn't want to use the existing alternatives. That's when I set out to create India's first sustainable baby care brand, with our hero product being Organic Bamboo Diapers . After months of extensive research and testing, we successfully launched Allter. Our primary goal is to create a brand that balances functionality, ease of use, and sustainability. We firmly believe that parents shouldn't have to choose between what's best for their baby and what's good for the planet. Our ultimate vision is to make sustainability a mainstream concept, not just a trendy buzzword.We take a holistic approach to sustainability that covers every step of our value chain. From the sourcing of raw materials to disposal, we've created a 360-degree sustainability loop that priorities eco-friendliness. Our commitment is evident in our choice to source bamboo from sustainably managed forests, avoid hazardous chemicals during manufacturing, and recycle the same amount of plastic that's generated during our processes. We firmly believe that every small step counts towards creating a better future for our children.One of the challenges we're tackling with right now is creating eco-friendly packaging that doesn't compromise the integrity of our products. We're collaborating with top-tier suppliers from around the world to develop an innovative solution to this challenge. We wish to make every aspect of our brand as sustainable as possible.Dia Mirza has been a personal supporter of our brand and products even before she formally became an investor. Her belief in our mission to create more sustainable alternatives for parents everywhere was the driving force behind our collaboration. As both an eco-investor and a mother, Dia's unique insights have been invaluable and have resonated deeply with our core audience of parents. Her background in environmental activism and sustainability has also helped us to further refine our approach to develop more eco-friendly solutions.As a founder, all I can say is that we believe in transparency and authenticity, and we have taken concrete steps towards achieving sustainability in every aspect of our brand. We also welcome and encourage customers to do their own research and make informed decisions about the brands they choose to support. Building trust with customers is crucial for long-term success, and we strive to earn and maintain that trust every day.Our mantra is simple - parents buy from brands they trust. That's why we always put the parent at the forefront of every decision we make, whether it's a new launch or just a small campaign. We have built the organic disposable diaper category from the ground up. It hasn't been easy to create a space in an industry dominated by legacy brands, but with our continuous consumer education and stupendous products, we have been able to capture the hearts and minds of our audiences.","filter_flag":1}

Even the small wins count! Sustainable living may sound overwhelming if you don\u2019t know where to start, but you don\u2019t have to overhaul your entire life to go green. Every choice we make affects the environment in some way, so you can get the ball rolling with little swaps and positive changes that minimise your impact on the Earth. We asked 21 entrepreneurs in Singapore for advice on green living, and they came through with fantastic sustainability tips you can incorporate into your everyday life. Let\u2019s talk about sustainability in Singapore: Useful eco-friendly tips 1. Swap single-use period products for reusable ones A large amount of non-recyclable plastic is present in traditional sanitary products such as pads and tampons. To live more sustainably, swap out single-use period products for period underwear that\u2019s washable and reusable. You can wear it during WFH days or at night to sleep. Or on those days leading up to your period (because periods like to come when you least expect it and it never feels good walking around with a dry, itchy pad). If you have post-natal bladder leaks and constantly wear a panty liner, period underwear works just as efficiently. And it\u2019s much kinder to the environment. \u2013 Jamie Choon, founder of Mooncheeks Period Underwear 2. Show love to pre-loved and package-free goods My family and I started our low-waste journey in 2018. We purchase pre-loved items instead of new ones wherever possible. I love using Carousell or even Facebook marketplace for items we need like clothing and books. We also go for reusables instead of single-use items. For example, cloth napkins instead of kitchen paper towels, reusable containers to pack leftovers, and a reusable water bottle to curb the need to purchase packaged water. Also, have a meal plan, use leftovers creatively, and buy package-free produce to reduce food waste. We love supporting Unpackt. \u2013 Dr. Aparna Chari Sundar, certified KonMari consultant and Montessori positive parenting coach at Global Mindful Journey 3. Try solid soap bars We\u2019ve been using solid shampoo bars in our family for years now \u2013 they\u2019re easy to use and effective cleaners. My favourite is from the local brand Oasis Beauty Kitchen. We\u2019ve also gone from liquid soaps to solid form \u2013 for foaming hand wash, laundry soap, and household cleaners. Buying the concentrated form of what you need and adding water at home is a no-brainer. I get all these swaps from The Green Collective. We can\u2019t get away without using rubbish bags so we use food bags as rubbish holders as much as possible. The most common in our household is the standard sandwich bag \u2013 they hold a lot of rubbish and come with their own tie to secure the bag before throwing it down the chute! \u2013 Jennifer Gregory, director of Indosole Singapore 4. Ditch those shampoo bottles Did you know one bar of solid shampoo can replace between two to three bottles? That\u2019s because 90% of liquid shampoo is usually water. Solid shampoos only contain active ingredients, proteins, luscious butter and oils, and sometimes botanicals. Of course, they don\u2019t come with plastic bottles, so they don\u2019t generate plastic waste. After you finish it, nothing is left. Solid shampoos are usually free of parabens, sulfates, and silicones. So they offer benefits to the environment and health benefits to your hair. This brought me to study and work on creating my own recipes for handmade solid shampoos with ingredients that not only respect the environment but also my body. \u2013 Susan Calderon Urbina, founder of Sacha Botanicals 5. Reduce paper use and bring bags for grocery shopping Our mantra in this area is \u201cprogress, not perfection\u201d as we make each small step. The key changes we\u2019ve made at our office are: choosing non-centralised air-cons, using non-disposable cups or cutlery made available in the pantry, and reducing our paper use. On a personal level, a reusable water bottle, a coffee cup and a reusable cloth bag in my purse are small shifts in my daily habits that I implemented with ease. Silicon zip locks and cloth bags also come along when I go grocery shopping at the markets! \u2013 Puja Surtani, director of Eastern Scent 6. Go vegetarian, avoid takeaways and take public transportation Carry your own water bottle and bag to reduce your reliance on single-use plastics. Start with one day a week on a vegetarian diet, and gradually increase the frequency. Eating less meat can significantly reduce your carbon footprint and improve your health. Avoid takeaways or carry your own box. Takeaway containers are often made of non-biodegradable materials that harm the environment. Lastly, take public transport, walk or cycle to reduce your carbon footprint and improve your physical health. Cars are a major source of air pollution and contribute to climate change. \u2013 Ankita Jain, founder of Purple & Pure 7. Compost, volunteer and shop second hand Composting is one of the most generous acts we can offer the Earth. It\u2019s essentially about turning waste into soil, and soil is a nourishing fertile life force. Practice composting can be simple \u2013 gather your raw food waste into a container and put it in the freezer. Next, bring it to your local community garden for composting. Learn more with Soil Social. If you\u2019d like to offer a more active role, explore volunteering at a community garden. Habitat Collective and Cultivate Central will help guide you in the basics of gardening, growing food, and its importance in our life. Also, shop second-hand with Loving Loot or try brands like The Fashion Pulpit to refresh your wardrobe in a sustainable way. \u2013 Chloe Calderon Chotrani, somatic therapist at Body as Earth 8. Swap and shop mindfully Leverage your community! Use apps like Olio or Carousell to declutter and get amazing finds. We also leverage condo chats and neighbourhood groups to recycle and donate or even organise swap shops in function rooms. If you have kids\u2019 outgrown or second-hand items, list them with Nimbu. It\u2019s South-East Asia\u2019s first circular brand that provides a full service from pick-up to listing to finding new homes for your kids\u2019 beloved clothes, toys, books and shoes. If you can do without, find creative ways to not shop. But if you shop, use the item to its fullest. As long as you can keep the items away from a landfill, you\u2019re on the path towards sustainable living! Support sustainable local businesses and share about them with friends to magnify their impact. \u2013 Kriti Gupta, founder & CEO of Nimbu 9. Think about why you\u2019re making the change and align it with your values The most important step to making easy eco-conscious changes is to start within. Why are these changes important to you? Long-term change will only happen when you really tap into your values. Be aware of what you wear most and why; how does it make you feel? Is it the fabric, the functionality or the fit? This is your guide for how all your clothes should make you feel. And stop buying for the sake of buying \u2013 that goes for clothes, groceries, beauty products, and so on. Other tips include making meal plans to reduce food waste and buying second-hand furniture. The beauty of sustainability is that it always has benefits for you and the environment. \u2013 Biek Speijk, wardrobe curator and artist 10. Make your own natural floor cleaner I make my own no-nasties floor cleaner from fruit peels \u2013 also known as eco enzymes. This is a multi-purpose liquid that\u2019s produced from the fermentation of organic waste. It can be used as floor or kitchen cleaner, fruit and vegetable cleaner, insect repellent or plant fertiliser. Just take a bottle, add three parts of fruit peel, one part of sugar and 10 parts of water. Let it sit for three months and open the cap of the bottle every day to let out the fermentation gases. After that, strain the liquid and voila! It serves many purposes \u2013 it reduces food waste and the usage of chemical cleaners in your home, and re-uses single-use plastic bottles. \u2013 Sangeeta Nair, founder of The Eco-Statement 11. Small green steps count towards making an impact You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be part of the solution. Find an area you\u2019re passionate about and start there. This journey can be fun and enjoyable. Check out Project Drawdown, which shares nearly 100 solutions that already or almost exist, or Anatomy of Action by the UN, which lists the five major areas that will lead to collective change if each of us makes the change. If you\u2019re looking for quick wins, think about the decision you make on your plate. Adopting more of a flexitarian diet (more plants, less meat) is a great place to start. Check your bank and what it does with your money. Most of us don\u2019t realise that banks invest our money into projects that are harmful to the planet \u2013 but you can tell them not to. If you\u2019re a business owner, do an audit on your website and see how you can reduce the emissions it\u2019s producing. Look at how you can integrate small impactful actions with companies like Handprint. \u2013 Stephanie Dickson, founder of Green Is The New Black and Live Wide Awake 12. Go for reusable, second-hand and energy-efficient items Use plantable stationery, a reusable bag, and get a refillable water bottle and reusable coffee cup. You can also reduce food waste. Plan your meals in advance and only buy the food you need. Try to use leftovers instead of throwing them away. Go for energy-efficient light bulbs as they use less energy and last longer. If possible, get on public transportation instead of driving your car. This will reduce your carbon footprint and can be a more cost-effective option. Instead of buying new items, consider purchasing second-hand. It\u2019ll reduce the demand for new products and save money. \u2013 Radhika Mayani, founder of Left-handesign 13. Support eco-conscious, ethical and local businesses To reduce my environmental impact, I opt for reusable products over disposable ones: cloth bags for groceries, refillable water bottles, and cloth towels instead of paper towels. I also conserve resources and reduce my carbon footprint by saving energy whenever possible. This includes turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using energy-efficient appliances. I believe in supporting eco-friendly and ethical brands \u2013 like local small businesses and farmers \u2013 that prioritise sustainability and social responsibility. Plus, I use public transportation or walk whenever possible. Education and advocacy are essential components of sustainable living. By sharing my sustainable practices with my family and friends, I can inspire them to make similar changes in their own lives. \u2013 Michelle Chan, founder and certified natural skincare formulator at Miseico 14. Living a sustainable life can be fun! There\u2019s a misconception that living sustainably requires sacrificing comfort. Instead, see it as an opportunity to discover new experiences while contributing to a healthier planet. Rethink your purchasing habits. Be mindful of the brands you support. Choose responsible labels that prioritise eco-friendly materials, reduce waste, and ensure ethical labour practices. Consider buying used items. If you\u2019re buying a gift, think outside the box. Adopting trees for friends and family is memorable and rewilds the planet. Spice up your meal routine with plant-based options. Meat production is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Even if you can\u2019t commit to a vegan diet, go meat-free one day a week. My go-to app is aBillion, where you\u2019ll find thousands of restaurants with meat-free options. Take it from a former steak-loving French turned vegan: plant-based food is incredible! \u2013 Laure Guilbaud, co-founder and COO at Teorra, and founder and managing director at Kynd 15. Start simple with easy food swaps One quick way is to focus on everyday things we already do, like eating. Switch around what you eat, like going for noodles made from upcycled materials, rather than raw materials. You probably didn\u2019t know that spent barley grains, which are used to make beers, can actually be used to make better food! One example I love in the market is W0W Noodles. Sometimes, our aversion towards eating \u201cwaste by-products\u201d is a self-limiting belief. Before we say no to making a habit change, perhaps take some time to say, why not? \u2013 John Lim, founder of Live Young and Well 16. Choose solids instead of liquids in plastic containers I\u2019ve been gradually transitioning to solid personal care and home care products. They\u2019re compacted and concentrated, eliminating the need for large plastic containers and reducing emissions from transportation. In Singapore, there are many brands that offer solid soaps and shampoos, as well as laundry detergent sheets and cleaning capsules with natural, good quality ingredients. These products are eco-friendly, easy to use and space-saving. \u2013 Vrinda Jain, founder of Altereco 17. Opt for your bike over your car Biking has always been a part of my life, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that I truly realised its impact on the environment and my own mental health. As I pedal through the streets, I feel like I\u2019m doing my part to reduce my carbon footprint and protect the environment for future generations. Biking is a great way to clear my mind and reduce stress. It gives me a sense of freedom and independence, and the endorphins released make me feel happier and more energised throughout the day. \u2013 Dana Wolf, feng shui expert, certified KonMari consultant, and founder of Anjia Living 18. Make sustainability a part of what you love One of the first hacks I implemented when I embarked on my sustainability journey a few years ago was to start small. This means taking the first green step that makes sense to you \u2013 and repeating that over time. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, you can implement other baby steps that will eventually have a great impact on your life. Secondly, join a community of people that have a sustainability mindset. By meeting online or at events, you\u2019ll have a sense of belonging that\u2019ll help you keep up the good fight! Finally, embrace a test-and-learn mindset. Do the things that you love, that bring you energy. For some, this can mean gardening or composting; for others, it can be picking up trash on the beach or cooking vegan meals. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution; it\u2019s about doing the things that make sense to you. \u2013 Alya Annabi, founder of GreenPush and a sustainability change agent 19. Use eco-friendly kitchen sponges Did you know regular coloured sponges are made from petroleum-based ingredients that can leach microplastics into our waterways, harming our planet and wildlife? Eco-friendly alternatives like cellulose sponges are just as effective. Made from wood pulp processed into cellulose, they\u2019re topped with a natural luffa scrubber and sewn together with cotton twine. While eco-sponges may not last longer than your regular coloured sponge, they\u2019re 100% biodegradable and compostable. They also contain no harmful ingredients. Tip: cut the corner off a sponge that has done its time in the kitchen, so you can use it for grubbier tasks such as outdoor and heavier-duty cleaning \u2013 and make the most out of it before proper disposal. \u2013 Caroline Warren, owner of NaturalSpot 20. Remember: living sustainably doesn\u2019t have to be difficult or expensive Avoid using single-use plastics such as straws, utensils, and food containers. Try having a meat-free day once a week, or swap meat for plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, and tofu. You can also plan your meals, shop with a list, and store food properly to reduce food waste. Use leftovers in creative ways and compost food scraps. Turn off lights, unplug electronics, and adjust your thermostat to save energy. Use natural light whenever possible and hang your clothes to dry instead of using a dryer. Look for eco-friendly household products \u2013 made with environmentally friendly materials and packaging \u2013 such as cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, and personal care products. Take public transportation, walk, or bike instead of driving alone. This reduces your carbon footprint, saves money and promotes physical activity. Consider buying second-hand clothing and furniture, as this reduces the demand for new products and reduces waste. \u2013 Jen Gearing, change agent and founder of Rejenerate 21. Ditch your petrol ride for electric You\u2019ll save an average of 70% of carbon dioxide emitted while driving, and close to 100% when you charge your vehicle with renewable energy. Another advantage is that your vehicle won\u2019t pollute the air (hello, fresh air!) and you experience your drive in silence. With the current petrol prices, switching to electric is also good for your wallet. Easy change, right? \u2013 Maike van Grootel, managing partner at Niu Bali","filter_flag":1}

However, these new taxes come at a time when the Ghanaian economy is already heavily burdened. The COVID-19 pandemic as we are made to believe by government has had a significant impact on the economy, leading to job losses, reduced economic activity, and increased debt levels. Additionally, the country has been facing challenges such as high inflation, recent power cuts, and a depreciating currency, among others. The Excise Duty Amendment bill 2022 increases the tax rate on specific goods, such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and petroleum products. Similarly, the Growth and Sustainability Levy bill imposes a tax on the supply of goods and services, while the Income Tax Amendment bill 2022 affects individual taxpayers, including business owners. These new taxes are likely to have a significant impact on both businesses and consumers, as they could lead to an increase in the cost of production, higher prices, and an increase in the tax liability of individuals. As a management consultant, my expertise lies in helping businesses navigate challenges, develop strategies, and identify opportunities for growth. While I am not a tax expert, I have a good understanding of the impact that changes in tax policies can have on businesses and the broader economy. With the recent introduction of the Duty Amendment Bill 2022, the Growth and Sustainability Levy Bill, and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2022, I believe it is critical for businesses to evaluate how these changes will impact their operations and develop strategies to manage the potential effects Businesses For local businesses irrespective of size, the introduction of new taxes could pose a significant challenge. To sustain their operations amidst these changes, it's essential to take proactive actions, develop plans and strategies, and explore new opportunities. Here are some steps that businesses can take: First, Evaluate the impact: The first step for small and local businesses is to evaluate the impact of the new taxes on their operations. Businesses should calculate the additional taxes they will have to pay and assess how this will affect their bottom line. For example, a small restaurant may need to evaluate the impact of the new taxes on the cost of food supplies and calculate how this will affect the menu prices. To do this, businesses can conduct a thorough analysis of their financial statements and identify areas where they may face increased costs. By understanding the impact of the new taxes on their business, they can make informed decisions on pricing and other strategies to mitigate the impact. Evaluate your supply chain: With the increase in the tax rate on specific goods, it's essential to evaluate your supply chain and explore ways to reduce costs. This could include negotiating with suppliers, finding alternative sources of raw materials, or exploring new partnerships. Here are some steps: Identify potential vulnerabilities in the supply chain: businesses should assess their supply chain and identify areas where they may be at risk. This could include single-source suppliers, long lead times, or transportation bottlenecks. Build stronger relationships with suppliers: Building strong relationships with suppliers can help to mitigate potential supply chain risks. businesses can work with suppliers to establish backup plans in case of disruptions, negotiate better prices, or even collaborate on product development. Diversify suppliers: Diversifying the supply chain can help to reduce the risk of disruptions. Small and local businesses can work to identify alternative suppliers and establish relationships with them in case they need to switch suppliers quickly. Find alternative transportation methods: Transportation can be a significant bottleneck in the supply chain, especially for small and local businesses that may not have the resources to ship products quickly or efficiently. Finding alternative transportation methods, such as local delivery services or group shipping arrangements, can help to reduce costs and improve supply chain efficiency. Develop a cost-management strategy: To manage the impact of the new taxes on your bottom line, it's essential to develop a cost-management strategy that focuses on increasing efficiency in your operations. This could include investing in technology, streamlining processes, or outsourcing non-core functions. Analyze all expenses: Small and local businesses should conduct a thorough analysis of all their expenses to identify areas where costs can be reduced. This may involve looking at everything from office supplies to rent to employee benefits. Prioritize cost-saving measures: Not all cost-saving measures are created equal. Small and local businesses should prioritize measures that will have the most significant impact on the bottom line while minimizing the impact on operations or quality. Streamline operations: Small and local businesses can find ways to streamline operations to reduce costs. This may include automating certain tasks, improving inventory management, or outsourcing non-core functions. Implement energy-saving measures: Energy costs can be a significant expense for small and local businesses. Implementing energy-saving measures, such as using energy-efficient lighting or equipment, can help to reduce costs over the long term. Harmony Seyram Attise Explore new opportunities: While the introduction of new taxes may pose a challenge, it could also create new opportunities for small and local businesses. Such that, by focusing on locally sourced materials or developing new products or services that are not subject to the new taxes, businesses can differentiate themselves and capture new markets. Offer new products or services: businesses can explore new opportunities by offering new products or services. This may involve identifying gaps in the market or developing new products that complement their existing offerings. Expand into new markets: Small and local businesses can also explore new opportunities by expanding into new markets. This may involve targeting new customer segments, expanding geographically, or selling through new channels. Partner with other businesses: Especially small and medium sized businesses can also explore new opportunities by partnering with other small businesses. This may involve forming strategic alliances or joint ventures to reach new customers or develop new products. Seek professional advice: Businesses may benefit from seeking professional advice on tax planning and financial management. By working with a financial advisor or tax planner, businesses can develop a strategy to minimize their tax liability and optimize their finances. Seeking professional advice is an essential step for businesses to take in navigating the new tax environment. Professional advice can help businesses to identify potential tax savings opportunities, ensure compliance with new tax regulations, and avoid costly penalties for non-compliance. They can also provide guidance on how to structure business operations to minimize the impact of the new taxes. It is important for businesses to choose the right professional adviser, who has the relevant expertise and experience to provide practical and effective advice. Business owners should seek referrals from trusted sources and conduct thorough due diligence before engaging any professional adviser. Additionally, the introduction of these new taxes comes at a challenging time for the economy. Local businesses need to understand the implications of these new taxes and take proactive actions to sustain their operations. Other alternative strategies for SMEs to consider Cut costs: In order to offset the additional tax burden, businesses should consider cutting costs wherever possible. This could involve reducing overheads, negotiating better deals with suppliers, or finding ways to reduce energy costs. For example, a local store may consider reducing the number of hours they are open to cut down on utility costs. Another strategy could be to negotiate better deals with suppliers or switch to cheaper suppliers where possible. Increase efficiency: Businesses should focus on increasing efficiency to maximize their profits. This could involve streamlining their operations, improving their inventory management, or adopting new technologies to automate tasks. So, businesses may adopt a cloud-based accounting system to reduce the time spent on bookkeeping tasks. They could also invest in inventory management software to optimize their stock levels and reduce waste. Diversify revenue streams: Small businesses should consider diversifying their revenue streams to reduce their reliance on any one source of income. This could involve offering new products or services, expanding into new markets, or creating partnerships with other businesses. For example, a small retail store could start selling their products online to reach a wider audience. Alternatively, they could partner with a complementary business to offer bundled products or services. Business owners Business owners play a critical role in ensuring the sustainability of their businesses, particularly during challenging times. Here are some steps that business owners can take to manage the impact of the new taxes and address potential layoffs: Review your business model: The introduction of new taxes could lead to a significant increase in the cost of production, which could, in turn, impact profitability. Business owners should review their business model and explore ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve profitability. Prioritize essential functions: During difficult times, it's essential to prioritize essential functions and focus on the core activities that drive revenue. Business owners should evaluate their operations and identify areas that can be streamlined, outsourced, or temporarily suspended to reduce costs. Consider alternative revenue streams: To mitigate the impact of potential layoffs, business owners should explore alternative revenue streams. This could include expanding product or service offerings, exploring new markets, or diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on specific products or services. Communicate with employees: If layoffs are necessary, it's essential to communicate with employees and provide support during the transition. Business owners should be transparent about the reasons for the layoffs, provide clear timelines, and offer assistance with job search or career development. Seek professional advice: Business owners may benefit from seeking professional advice on financial management, tax planning, and human resources. By working with experts in these areas, business owners can also develop a strategy to manage the impact of the new taxes and potential layoffs. The introduction of new taxes in Ghana could have significant implications for businesses and could potentially lead to job losses. By taking these steps, business owners can navigate the challenges posed by an already burdened economy and sustain their operations. Consumers Indeed, consumers will also be impacted by the new taxes, which could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and services, potentially resulting in a decrease in the standard of living. Here are some steps that consumers can take to manage the impact of the new taxes: Budgeting: Reviewing and adjusting one's budget is a critical step in managing the impact of the new taxes. Consumers should start by identifying their essential expenses, such as rent\/mortgage, utilities, and groceries, and ensure that these are covered before allocating funds to non-essential expenses. They can use budgeting tools and apps to help them monitor their expenses and identify areas where they can reduce costs. Shopping around: Consumers can save money by exploring different options for goods and services. This can involve comparing prices between different stores or exploring online options. Consumers can also consider purchasing items in bulk, which can reduce costs over time. Prioritizing needs over wants: It's important to prioritize essential expenses over discretionary spending. Consumers should focus on meeting their basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare, before spending on non-essential items. Seek financial advice: Consumers may also benefit from seeking some financial advice to help them manage their finances during these times. Financial advisors can provide guidance on budgeting, saving, and investing, helping consumers make informed decisions about their finances. They can also provide advice on managing debt and improving credit scores. Support local businesses: Supporting local businesses can have a positive impact on the local economy and help businesses survive during challenging times. Consumers can consider purchasing from local businesses, which can provide a competitive advantage for these businesses and help sustain jobs. They can also recommend local businesses to their friends and family, helping to increase their customer base. The impact of the new taxes on consumers could be significant, but these are critical steps that consumers can take to manage their finances effectively Economy Certainly, the impact of these new taxes on the economy is multifaceted and complex. On the one hand, the introduction of these taxes is intended to help the government generate more revenue, which can be used to fund critical public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. This, in turn, can contribute to long-term economic growth by creating jobs and improving the standard of living for citizens. However, the implementation of these new taxes may also have some short-term negative effects on the economy. For example, the increase in the cost of goods and services resulting from the taxes may reduce consumer spending, which could lead to decreased sales and profits for businesses. This, may also lead to lay-offs and potentially increase the unemployment rate. Furthermore, the new taxes can impact foreign investment, which can have long-term implications for economic growth. If foreign investors perceive the new taxes to be too onerous, they may choose to invest elsewhere, which could lead to a reduction in foreign capital inflows. Overall, the impact of these taxes on the economy will depend on a variety of factors, including the implementation and enforcement of the tax policies, the responsiveness of businesses and consumers to the changes, and the broader economic and political context. However, with careful planning and management, it is possible for the government to achieve positive economic growth and development through the implementation of these new taxes. Can government meet the criteria for IMF bailout with the introduction of taxes? The introduction of these new taxes is part of the government's efforts to meet the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) criteria for a bailout. Whether or not the government will meet these criteria will depend on a variety of factors, including the successful implementation and enforcement of the new tax policies, as well as other reforms and measures being implemented to address the country's economic challenges. It's worth noting that the introduction of new taxes alone may not be enough to meet the IMF's criteria for a bailout. The IMF typically requires a comprehensive package of economic and financial reforms to be implemented, including measures to address fiscal deficits, improve the investment climate, and promote sustainable economic growth. Therefore, while these new taxes may be an important step towards meeting the IMF's criteria, the government will likely need to implement a range of other measures to address the country's economic challenges and secure the necessary support from the IMF. In conclusion, Ghana's recent new taxes, including the Excise Duty Amendment Bill 2022, the Growth and Sustainability Levy Bill 2022, and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2022, has caused widespread concern among businesses and consumers alike. The already-challenged and heavily-burdened economy is likely to face further strains as a result of these measures. For small and local businesses, the key to surviving these difficult times will be to evaluate their supply chain, develop a cost-management strategy, explore new opportunities, and seek professional advice where necessary. By taking these steps, businesses can improve their financial resilience and maintain their competitive edge in the marketplace. For consumers, the impact of these new taxes is likely to be felt through higher prices and a reduction in the overall standard of living. However, there are steps that individuals can take to mitigate the effects of these measures, such as adjusting their spending habits, seeking out deals and discounts, and exploring alternative sources of income. While the introduction of these new taxes is a challenging development for Ghana's economy, it is not necessarily an insurmountable one. With careful planning, strategic thinking, and a willingness to adapt, businesses and consumers alike can navigate this new tax landscape and emerge stronger and more resilient in the years ahead.
