In actual fact, \u2018circular\u2019 is not new at all. Pre-industrialization, it was the dominant economic model. Nothing was lost or discarded, everything was re-used, repaired, repurposed or recycled. And so the wheel went round. The 19th century saw the rise of the linear economy, where raw materials are transformed into products that are used until they are discarded as waste. This \u2018take-make-waste\u2019 model was driven by, among other things, the industrial revolution and the availability of cheap energy thanks to coal and steam. It is a polluting model that drives global environmental challenges, including climate change and biodiversity loss. Linear became totally dominant with mass production and the rise of the consumer society after World War II. That same period also saw, in response, the reintroduction of circular thinking. Key milestones included Boulding\u2019s influential 1966 essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth, the publication of Braungart and McDonough\u2019s Cradle to Cradle, and the advent of think-tanks such as the Biomimicry Institute and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. So where do we stand today? To focus minds and drive progress, many ambitious climate and circular economy targets have been set. The European Union, for example, wants to achieve a circular economy by 2050 as a precursor to becoming net-zero and halting biodiversity loss. The Netherlands was the first country to set a 100% circularity target for 2050, with the ambition to halve primary resource use by 2030. And the United Kingdom has adopted an ambitious program to deliver a net-zero National Health Service by 2050. But, on the whole, as IPCC chair Hoesung Lee commented, \u201cWe are walking when we should be sprinting.\" [1] The harsh reality is that the global situation is getting worse year-on-year, driven by rising material extraction and use: from 9.1% of global production based on circular economy principles in 2018, to 8.6% 2020, and now 7.2% in 2023 [2]. Statistics like these underline the need to rapidly accelerate the adoption of circularity. And nowhere more so than in healthcare. ","filter_flag":1}

Rheem\u2019s heat pump was extensively tested by the Department of Energy in sub-zero temperatures and delivered dependable heat and exceptional efficiency. Focused on residential, centrally ducted, electric-only heat pumps, the DOE's Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge assessed heat pump performance in the Canadian and northern US climate, where temperatures can get much colder than 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Following testing, it was determined that Rheem's residential heat pump had delivered outstanding results in the challenge. Rheem has a legacy of developing state-of-the-art heat pump technology. With a variety of leading products already in market, Rheem improved its existing innovative design to deliver 5% higher COP during heating at 5 degrees Fahrenheit ambient temperature than the DOE challenge specification, making it ideal for heating homes in the targeted climate regions. The Rheem heat pump also performed at a 9% higher HSPF2 than the DOE challenge specification, highlighting the unit's incredible efficiency. The DOE launched the Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to accelerate development and commercialization of next-generation heat pumps by supporting American innovation and manufacturing. The DOE recognized the need for an efficient heating and cooling system based on updated state and federal policies and the growing demand for decarbonization. Rheem has always been at the forefront of sustainability efforts, especially since announcing its \"A Greater Degree of Good\" initiative, and has made notable progress toward the 2025 sustainability goals which encompass intelligent products, responsible processes and inspired people. \"Rheem is committed to making a difference with the products we create, and our sustainability efforts know no bounds,\" said Jeff Goss, Director, Product Management, at Rheem. \"We were not surprised that our team of dedicated, innovative engineers at Rheem developed a residential heat pump that was able to provide 77 percent of nominal heating capacity at \u221215 degrees Fahrenheit ambient temperature and provided uninterrupted heating operation at \u221223 degrees Fahrenheit ambient temperature surpassing expectations and delivering top quality performance.\" Heating and\/or cooling a home, along with water heating, account for 40% of the primary energy consumption in buildings in the United States and are a major source of carbon emissions. As Rheem's heat pumps run on electricity, they reduce the need for natural gas, making them an ideal solution for homeowners to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency. Heat pumps are more efficient than electric resistance heating, and Rheem's heat pump needs less supplementary heating due to its improved performance in cold ambient temperatures. Together, these elements, and their ability to function at a wider range of ambient temperatures, make them a more sustainable heating option.

The European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) will affect all but the smallest European data centers, but its impact will reverberate widely. An important milestone has now been reached. On February 27, 2022, the European Commission (EC) published its final draft of the Task A report Reporting requirements on the energy performance and sustainability of data centers for the Energy Efficiency Directive. This document is not available online 13 Apr 2023 A tidal wave of regulations How will the data center industry handle the European tsunami? The publication of this final draft, just two months after the EC closed comments on the first draft of the Task A document, indicates that the EC and the European Parliament are committed to requiring the first data submittal under the EED for the 2023 calendar year on March 15, 2024. You need to act quickly Uptime Institute was among many organizations to submit feedback and comments (here are comments from the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance). The EC reviewed all comments carefully, and this resulted in significant changes to the initial draft. Not all requirements in this final draft will be enthusiastically received by the industry. If they are to comply, data center operators, particularly colocation providers and their IT tenants, will need to quickly establish processes and protocols to collect the wide-ranging dataset. They will also be required to prepare and submit their initial report in just 12 months (by March 2024). In the final draft, the EC proposes expanding the reported data well beyond the scope established in the EED recast, though much of the data will now be held \u201cin private\u201d. The EC and the European Parliament are committed to requiring the first data submittal under the EED for the 2023 calendar year on March 15, 2024. Portions of the EC\u2019s proposal for server and storage capacity indicators are a cause for concern. SPECint and floating-point measurements for servers and input operations per second (IOPS) capacity and real-time data for storage products are not widely available. A major industry effort would be required to generate and compile the required data. As the EC appears to be ready to designate their capacity measurements of choice in the Task A document, it is important for the industry to comment, and offer alternatives. While most of the required data is readily available to data centers and IT operators, there will be concerns about providing confidential business information and challenges for colocation operators and their tenants to gather and aggregate data. There is also some indicator data that will be very difficult to generate and compile. Many owners and operators should note that reporting the proposed mandatory operating and indicator data will reveal many details and differences across data center facilities, raising more questions than answers from legislators, regulators, and the public. Data center definition and classification The EC has proposed to define a data center using the Eurostat definition, in accordance with the regulation (EU) 2022\/132: \u201dA data center is defined as a structure or a group of structures used to house, connect and operate computer systems\/servers and associated equipment for data storage, processing and\/or distribution, as well as related activities.\u201c Definitions of a \u201dstructure\u201d and \u201dassociated equipment\u201d are also proposed to better align with the Eurostat definition to EN 50600, and will likely be published as guidance to the EED requirements. Data centers will be classified into four categories as detailed in EN 50600: enterprise, colocation, cohosting, and network operator. For the EU's purposes, hyperscaler cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure are classified as \"cohosting\" facilities as they fit within the following definition: \"a data center in which multiple customers are provided with access to network(s), servers and storage equipment on which they operate their own services\/applications. Both the information technology equipment and the support infrastructure of the building are provided as a service by the data center operator\". Data and indicator reporting will be consistent for all four data center categories. The data from each category will likely be assessed against the proposed indicators to analyze and apply best practices and efficiency thresholds across data center types. Some additional definitions have been included to clarify requirements under the EED. The most consequential is the definition of information and communications technology (ICT) installed power demand as the aggregation of the rated input power in kilowatts (kW) of the installed IT equipment. This is unlikely to be well received: the rated power for a given IT equipment product is a worse-case power demand used to size electrical breakers. It can overestimate the actual power demand and, by extension, the calculated energy consumption by a factor of two or more. The IT installed capacity is visible only to the regulators, but it risks a significant overestimation of potential data center energy consumption. It may also distort ratios, utilization and efficiency metrics that are calculated using this data. Data center reporting elements and responsibility Table 1 details the data reporting requirements mandated explicitly in the EED recast (represented by an asterisk) and proposed in the Task A report. The data covers three broad categories: Building data . This category covers basic information about the building, its location, overall IT space area and basic operating indicators, such as energy consumption and quantities of data stored and transmitted. . This category covers basic information about the building, its location, overall IT space area and basic operating indicators, such as energy consumption and quantities of data stored and transmitted. The reporting organization domain of control . The EC wants to understand what aspects of data center operations are controlled by the colocation or cloud service provider, and what operations are controlled by the IT operator. Only the enterprise operator will have total control. For some cohosting service types, such as bare metal and infrastructure as a service, the cloud operator will cede control of the operator\/hypervisor and software elements to the IT operator. .

Only the enterprise operator will have total control. For some cohosting service types, such as bare metal and infrastructure as a service, the cloud operator will cede control of the operator\/hypervisor and software elements to the IT operator. Operation. The EC appears to be collecting this data to understand the impact of resiliency and IT equipment density on energy efficiency. Table 1. Required EED reporting requirements \u2013 Uptime Institute This data should be readily available to data center operators in all categories and relatively easy to collect in aggregate, even for colocation operators. The data reporting requirements rest with the owner and operator of the data center. The owner\/operator is the controlling entity for the enterprise, cohosting, and network operator. The responsibility for reporting is placed on the colocation operator. This conflicts with the view that colocation operators are not responsible for their IT tenants\u2019 operations, but it is a practical solution to aggregating data For colocation operators, the operational responsibility is shared between the colocation operator (that manages the physical facility systems) and the IT operator (that controls the IT equipment and systems). The Task A document places the responsibility for the reporting requirements on the colocation operator. While this directly conflicts with the colocation operators\u2019 view that they are not responsible for their IT tenants\u2019 operations, it is the practical solution to aggregating the required data for each reporting location. Indicators and methodologies The industry should pay particular attention to Section 9 of the Task A document (Indicators and methodologies for energy performance and sustainability of data centers). This section details the roadmap for, and the boundaries of, the development of data center energy performance and sustainability indicators. The EC recognizes, however, that developing representative, meaningful indicators requires further study, more data collection and additional stakeholder input. The concern is that the EC has, through its proposals for data collection (Table 2), clearly mapped out its planned choice of capacity and performance metrics. Uptime considers their choices for server and storage products not to be in the best interests of the data center industry. IT operators should advise the EC that other capacity metrics should be considered and evaluated. Table 2. Proposed measurements and indicators \u2013 Uptime Institute In Uptime\u2019s view, there are three areas of concern regarding the EC\u2019s choice of \u201cProductivity and data functions\u201d. Capacity data from SPECint or a floating-point \"worklet\" (a SPECint task) are not readily available and will require a major industry initiative to create a usable dataset. The server efficiency rating tool (SERT) CPU worklet 100% workload measurements can provide a representative, comparative capacity value based on CPU type. SERT measurement data must be generated for all servers sold into the EU and ITI\u2019s The Green Grid has collected SERT measurement data for over 1,000 configurations. The existing SERT dataset, and the need to generate measurements for new products, offers the best approach to create representative server capacity data for use in efficiency metrics. and will require a major industry initiative to create a usable dataset.

The existing SERT dataset, and the need to generate measurements for new products, offers the best approach to create representative server capacity data for use in efficiency metrics.

An easier and more effective metric is to track the populated storage capacity versus total storage capacity. . An easier and more effective metric is to track the populated storage capacity versus total storage capacity. Server idle energy consumption, reported either as the idle power value or the ratio of idle power to maximum power, is a poor metric. A low idle power value or ratio is achieved through enabling power management functions. Power management functions cause degradation in server response time. This degradation is acceptable for some workloads, but unacceptable for others. A better regulatory focus is to increase the utilization of IT equipment and work delivered per unit of energy consumed, which will reduce the time that a server is at low utilization or in idle mode. Improvements in the EED are needed and it is important that operators and industry professionals provide final guidance and direction while the opportunity still exists","filter_flag":1}

A global push to live more sustainably and reduce our collective carbon footprint is compelling manufacturers to rethink how products are created. Consider these three phases of window and door products\u2019 lifecycle: Manufacturing, the life of the product in a structure, and end-of-life recyclability. Paul Adams, who has been with Deceuninck North America for more than 15 years and currently serves as the global vice president of materials innovation, discussed the importance of creating formulas that meet multiple industry and sustainability criteria, remain respectful of the environment, and are recyclable at the end of their lifecycle. Deceuninck\u2019s Innergy is a composite made of up to 20 percent bio-based resin and is designed to maximize thermal performance. Climate change considerations During the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s 2021 Materials Day symposium, research scientist and professor Elsa Olivetti began her opening remarks with, \u201cMaterials play a central role in all aspects of the new technologies needed to achieve sustainability goals and address climate change.\u201d The focus on designing sustainable materials pervades all industries, but it is particularly relevant to the building, design and construction space since it creates a third of the world\u2019s waste. The climate crisis and ever-increasing global temperatures have placed a greater demand on the research that goes into advancing polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, formulas that the window and door industry uses. The ones previously relied upon are not as effective as they once were. The environment is changing, which mandates higher-performing, longer-lasting windows. \u201cWe must create windows for today, not for an environment that existed 20 years ago,\u201d Adams stresses. \u201cThese new products must endure for 25 or 30 years, in addition to remaining recyclable and maintaining 90 percent of their original physical properties at the end of their lifecycle.\u201d Because higher outside temperatures cause window systems to degrade, materials science teams worldwide are emphasizing the development of new chemistries. \u201cMuch of what we do is in response to climate change and is in line with the overall sustainability model of our organization,\u201d Adams notes. A closer look at chemistry Where there\u2019s color, there must be the right chemistry in place to allow it to shine over the long haul. Color plays a big role in the increased homeowner and architect demand for aesthetic options, and the demand for new pigments and properties has required manufacturers in the window and door industry to spend more research and development hours on pigment chemistry. To move the needle, organizations are even tapping into what works in other sectors. \u201cWe explored paints and coatings used specifically for military vehicles that are designed to reflect heat. We then applied that technology to building materials such as PVC extrusions to reduce heat gain in windows,\u201d explains Adams. Material chemistry also plays a key role in creating products that contribute to a more sustainable built environment. Using plant-based additives is an excellent place to start. Utilizing natural materials creates a cleaner final product that is more recyclable at the end of its lifecycle. One might not traditionally think \u201cplants\u201d when considering the elements used to create windows or other plastics products, but these sustainable, organic materials can be used as lubricants and serve other important functions in the production of PVC windows and doors. Looking at material chemistry can also help manufacturers identify methods to reduce other common concerns for window and door profiles, including fading. Helping the homeowner Eco-conscious consumers are paying attention to the environment and want to live in homes that save energy and minimize harmful effects on the planet. The industry is progressing, as today\u2019s window and door extrusions are comprised of more eco-friendly materials compared to plastics of the past. This starts at stage one: the composition of the materials used to create the window systems from the start. Manufacturers need to anticipate what homeowners will need. Energy-efficiency requirements for windows vary by jurisdiction and by climate, but regardless of region, by reducing the amount of thermal loss through a window frame, less energy is required to heat or cool a home. This has a positive impact on the environment, can decrease annual energy costs for homeowners, and create a more comfortable living environment. Challenges creating opportunity Supply chain constraints over the past couple of years resulted in the need for manufacturers to shift toward alternative raw material options and, in some cases, complete reformulation. Teams had to adjust and find new ways to create while maintaining or improving upon the properties of materials. This highlights the importance of remaining on the cutting edge of innovation. As it specifically relates to materials science, Adams shares his organization\u2019s plans for moving forward. \u201cDeceuninck is always striving for better-performing products that protect our environment and make use of natural materials,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIf we\u2019re not pushing the boundaries on innovation and keeping the promise of sustainability at the forefront of product development, we\u2019re not doing our part.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

On one hand, there is a growing emphasis on energy efficiency and digital technology, with new products and features emerging to meet these demands. On the other hand, manufacturers are contending with increasing competition, fluctuating raw material prices and supply chain issues, and evolving regulations and standards. The boiler industry as a whole \u2014 engineers, contractors and wholesalers \u2014 is a vital component of the global economy, with a market size that exceeded $85 billion in 2022 and is projected to continue growing at more than 7.5% CAGR from 2023 to 2032, according to Global Market Insights (http:\/\/bit.ly\/3FuV7JX). It\u2019s clear that the challenges that exist are not enough to slow this industry down \u2014 in fact, we\u2019re ramped up and ready to go the distance. To gain insight into the current state of the industry, we reached out to 18 industry-leading manufacturers. Aerco, Bosch, Bradford White, ECR International, HTP Boiler (Ariston USA), IBC (Rheem), Laars Heating Systems, Lochinvar, Navien, Noritz, NTI Boilers, RBI (Mestek), Rinnai, Thermal Solutions, Triangle Tube, U.S. Boiler Co., Velocity Boiler Works, and Weil-McLain shared their thoughts on the challenges and trends impacting the industry. From the push to meet the diverse needs of different market segments and to the impact of evolving regulations and standards, these manufacturers offered valuable insights into the state of the boiler industry. Boiling Points: Regulations, Standards and Future Trends The U.S. boiler industry is undergoing a significant transformation as the push for electrification and decarbonization intensifies. As the U.S. moves toward renewable energy sources and lower emissions, the role of traditional boilers in buildings and homes is changing, and alternative heating technologies are becoming more attractive Before we dive into the trends, it\u2019s key to understand what is pushing them forward. Like most industries, the boiler industry is subject to a range of regulations and standards related to safety, emissions and efficiency \u2014 which continue to evolve \u2014 and manufacturers must adapt their products and processes to comply with new requirements. The U.S. Department of Energy recently updated minimum efficiency standards, effective Jan. 10, 2023, for commercial packaged boilers. That\u2019s just the latest of many regulations that have come and gone, and many more that are in the works still. Eric Truskoski, vice president of administration and government affairs at Bradford White, notes, \u201cThe U.S. DOE is in the middle of a rulemaking for residential (consumer) boilers, and based on the DOE\u2019s regulatory agenda, we should see a proposed rule later this year and likely a final rule next year.\u201d This isn\u2019t news to anyone in the industry \u2014 not engineers, contractors or wholesalers, and especially not the manufacturers we spoke with. Neither is the fact that consumers are also part of the push for more efficient products. As homeowners continue to upgrade and replace existing systems in their homes, the call for environmentally friendly products with a smaller footprint also continue to grow. And it\u2019s not just homeowners. Commercial spaces, including federal buildings, hospitals, schools, etc., require more energy efficient options, too. In fact, the DOE\u2019s new building energy code requirements for federal buildings (http:\/\/bit.ly\/3lmVorA), which came into effect in March 2022, aim to cut down energy use and electrify appliances and equipment in 30% of federal government-owned building spaces by 2030. These new building codes are also creating notable impetus for the substitution of conventional heating systems to meet new energy efficiency provisions and LEED certification guidelines. So, how are manufacturers responding? It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all. In fact, a lot of it depends on where in the country products are being manufactured and sold. But one thing that is clear, they are all meeting the challenge head on with innovative solutions that not only meet consumer and regulatory demand, but in some cases, even exceed it. In fact, product manager Christopher Kyes insists, \u201cEnvironmental stewardship is one of our core philosophies at Bosch. It inspires us to innovate solutions that are climate-friendly and reduce our carbon footprint. We see the market recognizing this need as well in the increased demand for high efficiency, condensing boilers.\u201d Bosch isn\u2019t the only manufacturer boasting high efficiency condensing boilers. Most of the manufacturers, including Aerco, ECR International, IBC, Navien, Triangle Tube and others highlight their products in this category. But coming off the heels of 2023 AHR Expo, the buzz was around decarbonization. According to the 2023 Trend Report (https:\/\/bit.ly\/40im3V0) released before the expo, regulations remain a driving force toward a cleaner future, and that places an emphasis on eliminating carbon emissions. In fact, the AHRI board of directors just last year approved a decarbonization statement (http:\/\/bit.ly\/3lndbyM) reiterating the association\u2019s position in support of efforts that reduce carbon emissions while ensuring continued affordable consumer access to HVAC and water heating products and equipment that meets their needs. One way to achieve decarbonization in the boiler industry is to switch from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas to renewable energy sources like biomass, hydrogen or electricity from renewable sources. Another way to decarbonize is to increase the use of alternative heating technologies like heat pumps, which have gained popularity in recent years. The White House recently announced a $250 million investment from the Inflation Reduction Act (http:\/\/bit.ly\/3TDYOmB) to increase production of domestic heat pump manufacturing. These initiatives are expected to further drive the adoption of alternative heating technologies and contribute to the decarbonization of the boiler industry. Not everyone is convinced, however, that the time is now. \u201cIt is still early days for the boiler industry with regard to heat pumps,\u201d says Christian Zapata, product manager of hydronic solutions at Aerco. \u201cIt is true that heat pumps have gained significant interest in meeting building decarbonization goals and stringent government regulations. There are challenges, however, including (1) heat pumps require a larger footprint compared to gas solutions, and would rely on the use of thermal storage to meet peak load demand, and (2) how to maximize the benefit of the heat pump system such that it operates during times of the day when utility costs are low. That said, Aerco is looking closely at the market and evolving technologies with regard to heat pumps and other solutions that can meet customers\u2019 space heating needs.\u201d Adapting Boiler Solutions to Meet Sustainable Demands of Today To meet the sustainability demands of today, the boiler industry is turning to electrification and heat-pump technology. Let\u2019s break it all down\u2026 Electrification Electrification is a crucial step in decarbonization, as it involves the transition from fossil fuel-powered boilers to electric boilers. Electric boilers are highly efficient, emit no pollutants or greenhouse gases, and are often cheaper to install and maintain. Electrification also enables the integration of renewable energy sources, reducing the carbon footprint of commercial and industrial buildings. However, electrification alone is not a complete solution to decarbonizing the boiler industry. The electricity used to power electric boilers must come from renewable sources for a sustainable future. Electrification also requires significant investments in infrastructure, which may not be viable for all building types. Jim Schnorr, vice president of sales at Thermal Solutions, notes that although the push for electrification aims to increase energy efficiency, \u201cit\u2019s ironic that there seems to be little consideration given to the energy losses that occur during the generation and transmission of electricity.\u201d Nick Lane, product manager of hydronic solutions at Aerco, agrees, noting, \u201cEngineers and facility owners need to take a close look at all factors in boiler systems, particularly as there is a move toward electrification. Careful consideration must be given to whether the grid can satisfactorily handle the increase in electricity demand created by a switch to an electric boiler or heat pump. For projects with a strong focus on the environmental impact, it is key to consider how the electricity is produced at the power plant. Coal is an obvious example. In cases where a power plant uses natural gas to generate electricity, it is often much more energy efficient when used at the local source, such as a gas-fired boiler.\u201d As electrification becomes more popular however, it gives way to heat pump technology, which offers a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional boilers. \u201cWe have seen heat pump technology and presence increase significantly over the years,\u201d says Dave Walsh, vice president of sales at NTI-USA. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the current electrification push is driving that even faster.\u201d Heat Pump Technology Heat pump technology is another important solution in the boiler industry\u2019s shift toward sustainability. And, according to the 2023 Trend Report out of AHR Expo, heat pump technology is advancing at a remarkable rate \u2014 this is especially true in regions with mild climates. It\u2019s not just milder climates, however; heat pump technology continues to grow in popularity in certain parts of the country, too. Louise Prader, senior director of product management at Bradford White, notes that this is happening primarily in the residential sector \u2014 in areas where utility rebates are in place and different policies are requiring it. \u201cWe have to make sure that our electric infrastructure, manufacturer and supply chain capabilities, and installer confidence are all aligned to work toward some of the aggressive regulatory goals built around heat pump technology.\u201d So, how exactly does heat pump technology work? By moving heat from one place to another, heat pumps provide an efficient and renewable way to heat and cool buildings. They can also be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind, further reducing their carbon footprint. In addition to being sustainable, heat pumps are highly versatile, offering a range of options for different types of buildings and climates Despite their growing popularity, however, some manufacturers remain cautious to move too quickly. \u201cWe have seen this happen in the past,\u201d says Dave Hoskyn, product management director at Navien. \u201cWhen an energy code change forces the industry to adapt to new regulations, often these changes are put in place without fully addressing the challenges that new products bring.\u201d He adds: \u201cHeat pumps are a viable option in some cases, but energy supply and demand will need to be addressed. Along with the electricity required to operate, low temperature performance and maximum supply water temperatures must be looked at, especially when considering replacing boilers. HPWH technology will soon be undergoing revisions to replace current refrigerant with more greenhouse gas friendly products. Navien is exploring options with heat pumps, since we know they are here to stay. We want to be sure that if \u2014 and when \u2014 we introduce a product it will meet the needs of the market and our customers.\u201d Andrew Tran, senior marketing manager at Noritz, echoes that sentiment, noting that even as Noritz is committed to reducing the company\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% by 2030, \u201cwe are still in favor of a cautious mixed approach. Heat pumps may ultimately become the primary means to obtain the goal of heating the home with zero carbon emissions, however Noritz is still pursuing a mix of technologies to account for various infrastructure, technological, environmental and comfort factors.\u201d Noritz believes this mixed approach is ultimately the best way forward versus focusing on a single solution. Jim Schnorr, vice president of sales at Thermal Solutions, also agrees in that there is so much more to consider outside just the benefits of decarbonization. \u201cThis is hitting all parts of legacy hydronic systems. This is coming despite so many questions around grids, supply, cost to run, costs of equipment, the size of equipment, and true impact on the environment. Change brings opportunity \u2014 and this change needs major subsidies to drive it, and supplying electric past what we can today remains a big hurdle.\u201d While most all the manufacturers we spoke with see heat pump technology making its presence known \u2014 and weaving its way into the manufacturing plants \u2014 some were already discussing current or future plans to introduce new products that will meet consumer demand. \u201cIn addition to offering some of the most reliable boilers in the world, we also provide highly energy-efficient water-source, geothermal and air-source heat pump systems,\u201d says Bosch\u2019s Kyes. Prader of Bradford White adds, \u201cWe are actively engaged in the heat pump water heating space and continue to invest in new technologies and products, such as Bradford White\u2019s AeroTherm HPWH with BW Connect, to support the current and future needs of our customers.\u201d Bob Shea, executive director of ECR International, notes, \u201cECR provides our valued customers two complete heat pumps lines \u2014 the Maximum Heating and Advantage Series. We\u2019ve elected to provide two offerings because we recognize that applications vary and not all projects will require the same features and benefits giving our customers a choice that best suits their needs. \u201cThere is a worldwide movement toward electrification, and we intend to be a part of it,\u201d says Doug Dodds, vice president of sales and marketing at IBC. \u201cWe are presently developing an air-to-water heat pump and a proprietary control system that will control the heating, cooling, domestic hot water and a gas or electric boiler as part of a hybrid system.\u201d \u201cHeat pump technology will play an important role in the future of space and water heating and Laars is developing heat pump technology to meet those future needs,\u201d says Chuck O\u2019Donnell, director of marketing. He does add, however, \u201cgas-fired boilers and water heaters will continue to play a critical role for years to come as the electrical supply infrastructure is built out to support North America\u2019s electrification goals. Jennifer Russell, segment development manager for decarbonization at Lochinvar, says: \u201cWith the continued growth of the heat pump water heater market, Lochinvar has ensured that we are well-poised to meet the increasing demand head on. We offer both air source and water source commercial heat pump water heaters as well as residential heat pumps water heaters. Since heat pump water heaters require storage tanks, Lochinvar also offers our patent-pending Thermal-Stor Heat Pump water heater storage tank, which features a unique baffle to keep hot water at the ready with its continual stratification. Lochinvar also unveiled an exciting new product at this year\u2019s AHR Expo \u2014 the Veritus air source commercial heat pump water heater.\u201d \u201cMestek, Inc., our parent company, has us well positioned for a potential shift in the marketplace,\u201d notes Matt Kleszczynski, director of marketing at RBI. \u201cWe have been providing heat pumps residentially for more than 12 years under the SpacePak brand of products. Commercially, we recently introduced an air-to-water heat pump under the RBI and Advanced Thermal Hydronics brands to fully complement our existing hydronic boiler and water heater segments. We also recently acquired Transom, a specialty manufacturer of both air-source and water-source commercial heat pumps designed to efficiently generate water temperatures as high as 140 degrees and 180 degrees from outside air temperatures as low as -20 degrees for both space and domestic water heating applications. Transom also manufactures a one-of-a-kind CO 2 heat pump water heater, the first commercial unit to be designed and manufactured in North America.\u201d \u201cThe recent developments in heat pumps indicate that customers are looking for more efficient solutions that can eventually lead to lower carbon emissions and have less impact on the environment,\u201d says John Kopf, senior product manager of innovation at Rinnai. \u201cTo that extent, Rinnai has been interested in developing these technologies while expanding its existing product portfolio. Even with all this buzz around electrification and heat pump technology, high efficiency condensing boilers aren\u2019t going anywhere, anytime soon. As the industry continues to prioritize sustainability and reducing carbon emissions, the use of high efficiency condensing boilers will undoubtedly continue to be a major player. By capturing and reusing the heat that is typically lost through flue gases, condensing boilers can achieve impressive levels of efficiency while reducing emissions. As manufacturers continue to innovate and bring new technologies to market, the collective impact of these efforts will make a significant difference. Dave DeVries, director of product management for Weil-McLain, states, \u201cWe have a broader view toward the technology challenges regarding decarbonization. This view recognizes that it will likely take all available technologies to solve our climate problem, including renewable electrification, renewable fuels, carbon capture, reduced demand from building efficiency improvements and upgrades to higher efficiency appliances. We are always exploring and evaluating new technologies and will bring them to market when they are technically and economically feasible for hydronic applications in our markets.\u201d The boiler industry\u2019s efforts to meet today\u2019s sustainable demands involve various technologies, including electric boilers, heat-pump systems and high efficiency condensing boilers. These solutions are paving the way for a more sustainable and low-carbon future by reducing carbon emissions, improving energy efficiency and utilizing renewable energy sources. We asked the manufacturers to tell us what steps they have taken to reduce the environmental impact of their boilers. Here\u2019s what they had to say: Aerco has been ahead of the curve as our condensing hot water boilers \u2014 such as the Aerco Benchmark and Benchmark Platinum families \u2014 already meet the updated minimum efficiency standards set by the DOE for commercial packaged boilers. \u2014Nick Lane, Product Manager, Hydronic Solutions, Aerco We have ensured that our heating solutions meet the 95% AFUE standard for Energy Star. Another critical way to reduce environmental impact is to optimize boiler performance. The control system we have designed for Greenstar is a great example of this. Using the Indoor Reset, the boiler can modulate its output based on the exact needs of the house \u2014 it can calculate heat loss as well as how long it will take to heat the space. This enables the unit to run more efficiently and conserve energy. To help with water quality issues, we have developed the Bosch Protection Pack, which protects the boiler and other parts in the heating system against the damaging effects of black iron oxide sludge and non-magnetic debris. \u2014Christopher Kyes, Product Manager, Bosch Thermotechnology All the boilers that we manufacture and sell meet the most current efficiency standards and regulations and we are working aggressively to ensure we have products for our customers that meet any boiler regulations that are on the horizon. \u2014Eric Truskoski, VP, Administration and Government Affairs, Bradford White ECR offers products at different efficiency levels, intended to meet the needs of our customers based upon the specific requirements of the application. The assumption that the highest levels of efficiency can be installed in every application is simply not the case. We offer customer choices to allow them to make the appropriate decisions based upon their specific needs. ECR is developing bio-fuel products as well as our next generation of residential condensing boilers, all of which are intended to offer the highest levels of efficiency while reducing emissions. \u2014Joe Langlois, Engineering and Marketing Director, ECR International We are, and always have been, focused on the highest possible efficiency and lowest emissions in our HTP Boilers. \u2014Joshua Goncalves, Product Marketing Manager, Ariston\/HTP Boiler For more than 25 years, IBC has been a leader in high efficiency condensing technology and product innovation. With our bold approach to product and process improvements we aim to dramatically cut our impact on the environment, while empowering both our customers and employees to work and live sustainably. It\u2019s all a part of our bold vision for the future and equally bold commitment to designing for zero waste. \u2014Doug Dodds, Vice President, Sales & Marketing, IBC Laars offers a wide range of space and water heating solutions that meet or exceed all mandated energy efficiency standards while retaining the features and benefits that are of value to our customers. \u2014Chuck O\u2019Donnell, Director of Marketing, Laars Heating Systems Co Lochinvar\u2019s gas-fired boilers have some of the best thermal efficiencies in the industry, so much so that when the DOE announced new regulations requiring boilers to have at least 84% AFUE, only four Lochinvar models were affected. With our expansive boiler offering, Lochinvar has a multitude of options that meet and exceed this new standard. In addition to efficient operation, we\u2019ve put combustion under the magnifying glass and focused on the O 2 sensor of the CREST with Hellcat Combustion Technology. We\u2019ve designed the controls to be smarter and take weather shifts and barometric pressure into account to provide top-of-the-line performance. We\u2019re always looking to innovate and take strides to meet any requirement for any application. We have plans to make additional product introductions in 2023 and beyond that exhibit our dedication to environmental excellence. \u2014Jennifer Russell, Segment Development for Decarbonization, Lochinvar All the boilers and combi boilers we produce \u2014 and sell \u2014 are condensing, and rated at 95% AFUE, so they all meet or exceed efficiency standards in the market. All the boilers can load match with a high turndown ratio and outdoor reset, and the option to operate off supply or return temperatures gives them the ability to maintain peak efficiency. Built-in combustion controls constantly adjust to maintain the air-to-gas ratio on the burner, reducing the potential for higher CO 2 emissions. Navien is also exploring ways to minimize packaging and shipping material that end up in the waste stream. We are working to ensure our products can ship to our customers without damage, while at the same time minimizing packing material. \u2014Dave Hoskyn, Product Management Director, Navien Noritz has continued to develop and launch products that meet and exceed the minimum energy efficiency standards and continue to place significant emphasis on R&D to develop future products that can contribute to a carbon neutral target. \u2014Andrew Tran, Senior Marketing Manager, Noritz We are constantly evaluating both our legacy and new product developments to stay ahead of the ever-changing landscape of energy efficiency and the overall reduction of the carbon footprint. Any development project \u2014 whether continuous or new product development \u2014 has energy efficiency and DOE regulations at the forefront. All the projects are a direct result of current standards and more importantly the anticipation of future changes, keeping our products performing in the most efficient, environmentally friendly way possible. \u2014Matt Kleszczynski, Director of Marketing, RBI All recently launched Rinnai products greatly exceed current DOE requirements and address future efficiency increases. Rinnai has tested and approved its boilers and tankless water heaters for use of up to 30% of hydrogen mix with natural gas. There are multiple test sites in North America and around the world where Rinnai\u2019s hydrogen-fueled products are in use and being tested. Rinnai\u2019s latest development in a 100% hydrogen-powered water heater proves its commitment to reducing global warming, carbon neutrality and protecting the environment. \u2014John Kopf, Senior Product Manager, Innovation, Rinnai The testing to meet DOE requirements has increased efficiency levels across the board at Thermal Solutions. \u2014Jim Schnorr, Vice President of Sales, Thermal Solutions All the Triangle Tube boilers are modulating condensing gas boilers that achieve 95% AFUE on the residential sizes and a 95% thermal efficiency on the commercial sizes. These are some of the highest levels of efficiency achievable with the current technology. Our focus is always on improving product efficiency while not sacrificing reliability. \u2014Josh Garrett, Director of Engineering, Triangle Tube Reducing emissions while saving homeowners money with high efficiency products is a high priority. We continue to invest time and resources to comply with current and future energy efficiency standards. We are constantly investing in research and development of products that serve a greener future. One of those products is a new electric boiler, which was recently introduced at AHR Expo. This product was designed and manufactured completely in-house and represents the first in a series of new electric products offered by U.S. Boiler. \u2014David Hansen, Residential Product Marketing Manager, U.S. Boiler Co. All product offerings meet the current residential and commercial boiler energy efficiency standards. We are also aware of the demand within the marketplace for products that are greener and with that in mind, we will be introducing an electric boiler later in 2023. \u2014Lee Ensminger, National Sales Manager, Velocity Boiler Works As the shift toward high-efficiency products continues and boiler thermal efficiencies remain a key design element, we are constantly looking for ways to reduce energy consumption while achieving environmental sustainability. To that end, we recently announced the availability of our 2023 DOE-compliant commercial cast iron product portfolio with enhanced boiler efficiencies. The upgraded designs of our LGB Steam\/Water Series 3 and 88 Water Series 3 boiler product lines include exciting new features that go beyond just regulatory compliance. The LGB family meets the DOE regulation 431.87 requirements with enhanced thermal efficiencies up to 84% while the 88 product line sports thermal efficiencies up to 87%. Increasing the efficiencies of these boilers results in lower fuel consumption and operating costs while still providing reliable and trouble-free operation for property owners and facility managers. Similarly, our ECO Tec Series 2 is among the most energy efficient residential boilers on the market thanks to its 95% AFUE rating, while our new SVF units feature industry-leading thermal efficiencies up to 98%. \u2014Dave DeVries, Director of Product Management, Weil-McLain Different Market Segments, Manufacturing Processes, and Customer Training and Education To fully understand the state of the boiler market today, it is important to consider the people involved, the processes utilized, and the different market segments that exist. From residential to commercial to industrial, each sector presents unique opportunities and obstacles that must be navigated by manufacturers, engineers and installers. In this section, we will examine how different people, processes and market segments are shaping the boiler industry\u2019s evolution. Appealing to Different Market Segments Boiler manufacturers have more than just standards and regulations to consider, they need to also think about consumer demands \u2014 whether it be residential, commercial or industrial \u2014 around ease of use and installation, size and functionality, as well as smart features. It is no longer enough to just produce a high-quality product; it matters more than ever to put innovation at the forefront of everything they do. Each of the market segments within the boiler industry has distinct needs and requirements, which means that manufacturers must be able to offer a range of boiler models that cater to each market segment\u2019s needs and wants. For instance, residential customers might need smaller and more compact boilers that are energy-efficient and affordable. The residential segment is also seeing a shift toward combi boilers, which offer both heating and hot water. Bosch\u2019s Kyes points to their own market research, noting, \u201cThe annual compound growth rate for combi boilers was +24.3% between 2015-2020.\u201d IBC\u2019s Dodds adds, \u201cTraditionally a manufacturer of residential high efficiency condensing boilers, in recent years we have introduced combi and tankless water heater models and we are just about to introduce our first electric product line, the EBX High Efficiency Modulating Electric Boiler.\u201d Weil-McLain\u2019s ECO Tec combi boilers were developed as a direct result of a need to design products for confined spaces in retrofits and new buildings where space is at a premium. \u201cThe ECO Tec combines the warmth of high-efficiency space heating with the convenience of on-demand domestic hot water in a compact, space-saving, easy-to-install package,\u201d DeVries says. Jeff Vallett II, segment development manager for hydronics at Lochinvar, notes that they continue to put development dollars toward all categories of their business and offer several solutions to support decarbonization and greenhouse gas reduction efforts. \u201cOn the residential side, Lochinvar has a great boiler range with units to fit almost any application. All units have well-managed footprints as well as easy-to-use setup and troubleshooting tools. With even more options coming soon, Lochinvar offers industry-leading gas and electric space and water heating solutions.\u201d Although size, efficiency and functionality are major factors for homeowners \u2014 equally important is how well the boiler integrates with a smart home. \u201cAt Bradford White we continue to approach products from an applications perspective where we consider not only our products but how they integrate into the systems that they serve,\u201d says Mark Avron, national sales manager of specialty products. Rinnai\u2019s Kopf suggests, \u201cResidential customers expect new HVACR products to have smarter controls and be able to integrate with their other smart appliances throughout the home. A good example would be homeowners controlling their heating and cooling equipment using smart thermostats either via mobile app or voice through Amazon Alexa or Google Home.\u201d He adds, \u201cHomeowners are also interested in receiving early warnings of leaks and equipment in need of preventative maintenance.\u201d Rinnai will be launching a new mobile app that will address the needs of both, homeowners and installing contractors. It\u2019s important to note that installers play a critical role in the homeowner\u2019s buying journey. \u201cAcross the market, technicians naturally want to reduce the time needed for installation,\u201d says Bosch\u2019s Kyes. \u201cWe have been hard at work on improving our controls to make them simple, straightforward and easy to operate. The Singular Boiler is a great example.\u201d Bradford White\u2019s Avron agrees, noting \u201cdirect feedback from our customers tells us that time is one of their most valuable resources. With labor being at a premium in our industry today, it is even more important that we develop products that install quickly and easily.\u201d Chad Marzitelli of Triangle Tube also agrees, noting, \u201cWe are constantly improving our products to meet the needs of our customers. And our latest boiler, the Instinct Floor Standing model comes with Tsync Wi-Fi connectivity built in. This innovation allows contractors to access boiler information and troubleshoot numerous issues remotely.\u201d For commercial and industrial customers, larger and more powerful boilers are often necessary to handle high volumes of hot water or steam. However, they also seek products that can reduce operating costs and downtime. To help installers save time and space, modular designs have become a popular choice. \u201cThe Bosch SSB paired with the SSB Low Loss Header provides the whole primary loop for a boiler system. The Low Loss header combines high performance air and dirt removal with hydraulic separation as well as to make piping and installation of the primary loop easier,\u201d Kyes says. \u201cThe SSB modular design allows technicians to connect the boilers right up to one another to save space. Four SSB boilers can be connected to allow up to 4 million BTU of input.\u201d Preventative maintenance and remote access to equipment can also prevent costly replacements and downtime. \u201cAnd for commercial customers,\u201d Kopf says, \u201cavoiding downtime and costly replacements is the key. Since commercial systems are much larger than residential ones, minimizing their operating costs is also important. Rinnai has been working on adding new commercial boiler sizes featuring industry-leading efficiencies. These new boilers will have 97% thermal efficiency, include Wi-Fi and MBS connectivity, as well as intuitive controls with 7-inch color display.\u201d Just like on the residential side, the ability to manage boiler-to-boiler communication within the overall building automation system is critical in commercial applications as well. \u201cThis allows for lead-lag boiler operation for run time level-setting and overall fuel consumption efficiency,\u201d DeVries says. \u201cHybrid boiler applications have become more popular as the industry recognizes their design. For example, a non-condensing boiler can be used for lead operation in the core heating season months while a condensing boiler design can be used for lead operation in the heating season shoulder months. These can be especially effective in higher temperature replacement applications. Weil-McLain has the commercial boilers and controls to maximize system efficiency while seamlessly integrating into communication networks.\u201d Whether it is for residential, commercial or industrial applications, manufacturers must continue to develop products that are easy to install, reducing installation time and labor costs \u2014 but that are also environmentally friendly and efficient, particularly as the push for electrification continues. Maintaining Production and Manufacturing Processes During Uncertainty One of the biggest drivers of change in the boiler industry\u2019s daily operations has been the shortage of a skilled workforce, making it difficult for companies to recruit and retain talented employees, which can in turn impact the quality and efficiency of their operations. This challenge, alongside the call to run more environmentally friendly operations, has led to a shift toward more advanced manufacturing technologies, such as automation and robotics, that can help companies reduce their energy consumption and improve their environmental footprint \u2014 and help with labor shortage. Peter Kattula, senior vice president and general manager of Bradford White, notes, \u201cWe are investing in our manufacturing processes and effectiveness to meet the evolving needs of our customers as well as regulatory changes. Continuous improvement and innovation are foundational to our culture, and we are always working on improving our quality and operational efficiencies. As staffing continues to be a challenge, we are leveraging automated technologies in equipment, and offering skill upgrade opportunities to our team members so we can continue to manufacture our \u2018Built to be the Best\u2019 products.\u201d Although automation and robotics has its advantages, these technologies do require significant investment and retraining of the workforce, which can be difficult when times are already strained. Laars\u2019 O\u2019Donnell says: \u201cWe have progressed overall manufacturing effectiveness considering staffing challenges by leveraging advancements in equipment, such as robotics and automated production capabilities, and in people by cross training manufacturing team members to create a more flexible workforce. These changes have produced a much more efficient and nimble operation.\u201d Another major challenge facing the boiler industry is the ongoing effects stemming from the pandemic, which have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains. This has led to shortages of critical materials and components, which has caused project delays and uncertainty in project completion. To address this challenge, manufacturers are exploring new ways to reduce their dependence on traditional supply chains and increase their resilience to future disruptions. \u201cFortunately, Aerco manufactures most of its boilers \u2014 including our heat exchangers \u2014 in our Blauvelt, N.Y. and Ft. Worth, Texas facilities, so we were already committed to domestic manufacturing to better meet manufacture and delivery times,\u201d Lanes says. \u201cOne of the changes that we implemented that will remain is that we have a more robust supply chain with additional suppliers. This aids our ability to maintain delivery schedules.\u201d Lochinvar\u2019s Vallett stresses the importance of communication: \u201cEveryone in the industry faced challenges with the supply chain in 2022 and we took this as a learning opportunity to further improve our production and manufacturing processes. We learned that it\u2019s critically important for all the cards to be on the table to ensure a smooth process. Through our representative relationships, we\u2019ve put measures in place to optimize lead times, meet delivery dates and ensure availability. We\u2019ve also evaluated our order entry process as it relates to production planning and made great improvements that give our employees, reps and end users even more confidence in our brand.\u201d In the 2023 Trends Report released before AHR Expo, AHRI noted: \u201cAHRI members and staff have spent considerable time and resources seeking ways to ameliorate the [supply chain] issue, including working with the Department of Commerce, the International Trade Administration, the Department of State, and other entities on potential solutions. In the same report, HARDI noted that \u201cbecause of supply chain delays, distributors need to keep more inventory. Not only are there additional financial costs associated with carrying extra inventory, but operational efficiency is compromised when trying to function around it.\u201d Like all manufacturers, Navien has its share of supply chain and logistical issues. However, Hoskyn says: \u201cSince we produce almost all the components in our products \u2014 from the heat exchanger to the control boards \u2014 we have been able to control many of the issues and continue to produce and supply products. The availability of raw materials, along with the cost of those, need to be closely reviewed to ensure production levels, since the global markets can quickly change. Logistical issues will also need to be closely monitored as truck, rail and overseas shipping always seem to have a new issue come up each week.\u201d Joe Langlois, engineering and marketing director at ECR International, agrees about the issues with logistics and procurement. \u201cParts availability, especially electronics, has and will continue to be an issue. To address optimizing manufacturing, ECR has a robotics project that will be completed in 2023 to increase productivity.\u201d To succeed in the new normal of manufacturing and production processes in the boiler industry, manufacturers need to be agile, adaptable and innovative. They need to be willing to embrace new technologies and processes, invest in their workforce and collaborate with suppliers and other stakeholders to build a more resilient and sustainable supply chain. This requires a long-term strategic vision, a commitment to continuous improvement and a willingness to take risks and embrace change. Ultimately, those companies that can adapt and thrive in this changing landscape will be the ones that emerge as leaders in the industry. \u201cThe recent supply chain and manufacturing struggles have made everyone take a second look at manufacturing partners and sources and processes,\u201d Noritz\u2019 Tran says. \u201cThose manufacturers that were most agile and flexible were able to ride the wave better than those who weren\u2019t, so I think everyone has built-in contingency plans now that the weaknesses have been exposed.\u201d \u201cThe last three years affected all manufacturers with delays in our supply chain and it did influence the pace of production of some of our manufacturing lines at times,\u201d DeVries says. \u201cAn array of challenges stressed the system, not only supply chain related, but also personnel and training related items. Despite this, Weil-McLain has been able to quickly adapt and become stronger and nimbler as an organization. Our bench depth of approved alternative suppliers and materials has deepened. Our inventory management strategy has been modified and optimized to match the new environment. Our continued focus on harmonizing the efforts of our purchasing, HR, production, product management and engineering teams has helped to minimize any such disruptions while spurring innovation. We continue to do everything we can to meet demand and expect continuing improvement in supply chain factors throughout 2023.\u201d While supply chain issues have improved from the start of the pandemic, we are not still too normal. Or perhaps, this is just the new normal. In the 2023 Trends Report released before AHR Expo, HARDI stated that data suggests that the supply chain is in better health than it was a year ago. \u201cThere is progress, but gaps persist. High distributor inventories coupled with easing demand will relieve pressure on the supply chain, allowing reliability to continue to improve.\u201d Some manufacturers are taking steps to create their own new normal around all this uncertainty. To improve the delivery of its products and serve customers better, Rinnai invested in the opening of its new headquarters in Peachtree City, Ga., along with the introduction of a product strategy designed to bring new products to market. In addition to the new HQ, the new manufacturing and distribution center was opened in 2022 in Griffin, Ga., to bring Rinnai closer to its customers. \u201cFortunately, for the most part our teams did a tremendous job navigating supply chain issues and workforce concerns and our lead times stayed relative to our previous business climate across most of our boiler products,\u201d Kleszczynski says. \u201cRBI dealt with concerns as they surfaced and communicated openly with our customer base insuring transparency across the board. We, like others, had areas of concern but have taken the necessary steps to remedy them and establish new protocols to help prevent future occurrences. Some issues were flat out unavoidable, but, as stated previously, communication goes a long way into making difficult situations more tolerable.\u201d IBC\u2019s Dodds notes that they\u2019re focused on innovating with intent engineering solutions with lifetime sustainability in mind, from material selection to smart features to responsible recycling. \u201cWe\u2019re striving for operational excellence, working smarter and more sustainably to consume fewer resources, generate less waste and ensure simpler, safer processes,\u201d he says. We\u2019re also hiring and inspiring our teams to be next-generation thinkers and responsible stewards of our industry, the greater community and the environment.\u201d \u201cWith some major investments from our parent company, Ariston Group, we have expanded our production capabilities,\u201d Walsh states. \u201cThere were some growing pains but the manufacturing resources that we have access to with Ariston has allowed us to utilize a more structured and rigorous methodology to strive for operational excellence and apply methods and standards rigorously through the involvement of everyone on the team. Key benefits are performance increases in terms of ergonomics, safety, environment, energy, quality, cost, inventory, flexibility and service levels.\u201d A critical part of the manufacturing puzzle \u2014 regardless of market segment or production processes \u2014 is ensuring that customers (engineers, contractors and distributors) are fully trained on designing for, installing and servicing the boilers. Customer Training and Education All the manufacturers we spoke with have developed various training and education programs to improve safety, performance and perception of their products. We asked them to discuss the different kinds of training and education programs they offer industry wide. Here\u2019s what they had to say: \u201cAerco uses a \u2018blended learning\u2019 approach to reach customers in multiple formats conveniently. From our world-class Learning Management System to our hands-on Learning Centers, we had more than 3,000 course completions in 2022. We have web-based boiler training courses ranging from basic to advanced, virtual courses, webinars, videos and hands-on training. Technicians can visit one of our Learning Centers and become certified as an AercoTrained Technician and can eventually become an Aerco Master Technician. \u2014Christin Zapata, Product Manager, Hydronic Solutions, Aerco \u201cWe offer Bosch Product Trainings across all product lines through our eAcademy platform that are designed for contractors, sales representatives and engineers. Create an eAcademy account at www.training.boschprohvac.us to see what trainings are available in your area.\u201d \u2014Christopher Kyes, Product Manager, Bosch Thermotechnology \u201cBradford White is committed to training the professional contractor. We offer several training options at our International Technical Excellence Center (iTEC) in Middleville, Michigan. In-person field training is also available during our Bradford White trailer days in addition to our online For the Pro Training Academy. For the Pro Training Academy combines our existing in-person training programs with a new self-paced eLearning option for our valued Bradford White contractor customers, creating even more convenience and access in today\u2019s fast-moving world to help them be successful.\u201d \u2014Carl Pinto, Senior Director, Marketing Communications, Bradford White \u201cECR provides state-of-the-art training at both our Dunkirk and Utica facilities with fully operational equipment stations for true hands-on training. We recognize the importance of quality training and can bring it directly to the customer. Our team of Field Support Representatives has mobile Live-Fire demonstration and training units and travel through our service territories providing quality hands-on training to our valued customers. In addition, we offer a library of training and troubleshooting videos and vignettes on our dealer portals to support our customers when they are in the field.\u201d \u2014Bob Shea, Executive Director, ECR International \u201cFor 2023 Ariston has added two NATE certified classes to our roster: Hydronics 101 and Condensing Fine tuning. These classes will get the attendees three CEU credits each.\u201d \u2014Joshua Goncalves, Product Marketing Manager, Ariston\/HTP Boiler \u201cWe offer comprehensive training on all things hydronic and are putting the finishing touches on our brand new, 6,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art Innovative Learning Center in Lawnside, N.J. The learning center features a 2,500-square-foot \u201chot room\u201d with live-fired equipment for a hands-on learning experience. The grand opening is set for July 2023. This is in addition to our existing training center in Sheboygan, Wis.\u201d \u2014Doug Dodds, vice president of Sales & Marketing, IBC \u201cLaars holds many training sessions for contractors and distributors at our Laars Customer Center located at our headquarters in Rochester, N.H. The Laars Customer Center offers training on live-fired equipment allowing contractors a true hands-on educational experience.

The controls will reduce some installation costs for time and materials and provide unified controls across all the residential lineups. Our commercial boiler products will see a couple additions, with the NVW Volume Water boiler coming out with storage tank options to add to the system. The NVW has similar features to our current NFB-C fire tube commercial boilers, with high turn down ratios and easy to use touch panel control. The NFB-C boiler lineup will also see an expansion of the capacities that are available. Currently offered in 301k BTU and 399k BTU, we will introduce additional sizes up to 1 million BTU input. In addition to adding or updating boilers, Navien is expanding the water treatment products we currently offer. With the greater need and awareness of water quality, and the negative affect that poor water quality in a combi or boiler can have on the performance and lifespan of the products, having products to address issues will continue to be an important part of our product offering. \u2014Dave Hoskyn, Product Management Director, Navien NTI-USA has several product updates. First, we continue to expand our onboard Wi-Fi, NTInet, as standard equipment for many of our products. NTInet, allows the contractor and homeowner to connect the boiler to our platform. This gives the contractor the power to monitor, adjust and troubleshoot the boiler without having to go to the jobsite. NTInet will also send push notifications to alert customers that it\u2019s time for service or there is a problem. Often the contractor will know about a problem before the homeowner does. NTInet is available on our TRX, FTVN and TFTN models. The TFTN also features a dynamic 7-inch touch screen and very powerful Set Up Wizard. \u2014Dave Walsh, Vice President Sales, NTI-USA RBI has a lot going on in our R&D Center. We are constantly evaluating existing product solutions in unison with new equipment opportunities that stay ahead of the changing dynamics of the industry as it relates to not only performance efficiencies but also environmental concerns.

Every day, thousands of meters of Wettex sponge cloth are produced at Freudenberg\u2019s factory in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden. With a focus on sustainability, energy efficiency, and safety, progress is driven forward here with the help of solutions from ABB Electrification. ABB is a trusted partner that keeps the production running, with smart power distribution solutions. In the factory, thousands of drives are fed with current and voltage from ABB\u2019s low-voltage MNS3.0 switchgear with Emax 2 circuit breakers. The tough production environment places high demands on equipment that can withstand difficult conditions, but this is not noticeable in the bright switchgear rooms. Here, the switchgear rows are easily accessible to Freudenberg\u2019s electricians. Freudenberg\u2019s facility is being modernized to improve efficiency. Sustainability work takes place on many levels \u2013 improving the company's energy performance is one of them. \"Our facility is being modernized and made more efficient, and the same applies to our switchgear from ABB,\u201d says Richard Th\u00f6rnkvist, Maintenance\/Electrical Manager at Freudenberg. \u201cThey are rebuilt and upgraded when they are 20\u201325 years old. Old appliances and components that are difficult to obtain are replaced with more modern equipment that is more energy efficient. With new products, the risk of interruptions in production is reduced. We aim to have no breakdowns, and we have very few stoppages. These are good products.\" \u201cWe always adapt our solutions to the industry they serve,\u201d says Per Jennedal, Sales Representative at ABB Electrification Sweden. \u201cTinned rails and double contactors in an emergency stop circuit are two examples of special solutions here.\" The simplicity of the end product, a colorful sponge cloth, does not reflect the complicated process of making it. Renewable resources such as paper, viscose, cotton, and salt are used to produce a mass, that is extruded, steamed, and baked in an oven before patterns are printed and the sponge cloths are cut to the right size. ABB and Freudenberg have a long and successful history of cooperation. It's easy to be fooled by Wettex sponge cloth\u2019s unassuming look. But it takes both innovative engineering and energy efficient solutions for our sinks to shine. Wettex\u00ae and Freudenberg In 1949, Curt Lindqvist created the first Wettex sponge cloth at home in his kitchen by grinding a sponge through a meat grinder. Lindqvist\u2019s wife, Margareta, named it Wettex\u00ae, short for wet textile. Since 1990, Wettex\u00ae has been manufactured by Freudenberg, which is present in 60 countries and has 50,000 employees worldwide. ABB solutions at Freudenberg The Wettex production facility is home to a range of ABB power distribution solutions, such as switchgear, frequency converters, circuit breakers, I\/O-units.

A key component of both is a property\u2019s heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. According to executives at system providers, there are distinct topics that need to be on the table when a hotel owner, operator or developer sits down to discuss in-room HVAC needs. Topping the list for Jerad Adams, senior director of commercial product management for Friedrich Air Conditioning, are energy efficiency, ROI, comfort, dehumidification, in-room indoor air quality and aesthetics. \u201cThe solution now has to meet the designer and\/or hotel brand design language and overall brand image. This absolutely includes aesthetic requirements such as visible or hidden HVAC,\u201d Adams said. \u201cTop-of-mind significance to hotel operators is comfort, efficiency and noise levels,\u201d agreed Dennis Stinson, VP of sales for Fujitsu General America. \u201cThe hospitality industry is charged with providing a welcoming and inviting experience; comfort and solemness of space is paramount. Providing both with below-average operational costs is the goal.\u201d Similarly, Tom Varga, senior manager of business development-hospitality, hotels and lodging for Mitsubishi Electric Trane HVAC US, pointed to sustainability with energy savings, guest comfort and system control, citing simplicity at the guest level and comprehensive controls at a facility-management level. \u201cAll of these items can significantly impact the operating performance of a hotel while minimizing guests\u2019 complaints,\u201d he said. Prioritizing Needs All the companies supply product across the industry\u2019s segments, and concerns can differ among hotels in the lower-price, midprice and upper-price tiers. According to Adams, the prioritization of needs is based on hotel brand design standards, guest perception and flag segmentation as well as the owner's investment priority and intention for the property (i.e., long-term hold or a flip). \u201cValue hotels typically favor upfront cost and ROI. As we progress up the scale, midprice brands start to seek additional features and benefits like energy efficiency (energy-savings payback), guest comfort and aesthetic differentiation. Upper-price chains tend to prioritize all of these as an overall HVAC solution [and are] certainly more focused on guest comfort and aesthetics versus upfront equipment cost,\u201d he said. METUS\u2019 Varga said room layout and the hotel category usually drive discussions and decisions about HVAC technology. \u201cLarger hotels in the midprice and upper-price segments will typically consider a [variable refrigerant flow] system, while smaller hotels could use our light commercial all-climate heat pumps,\u201d he said. \u201cUpper-price and luxury hotels must consider elevated guest comfort expectations compared to economy hotels. Some hotels may need to account for local regulations concerning energy efficiency and emissions or a company interest in promoting sustainability. Other hotels may operate in municipalities prohibiting outside grilles and disallowing PTAC\/VTAC [Vertical Terminal Air Conditioner] solutions.\u201d He said hotel architecture also influences the style or type of system used. Changing regulations, concerns over air quality and sustainability also are influencing how HVAC systems are considered. \u201cThe most recent [U.S. Department of Energy] M-1 [minimum] efficiency requirements mandated more efficient unit and uniform testing procedures,\u201d Stinson said. \u201cInterestingly, while these regulations have required major overhauls to manufacturers of traditional HVAC systems, the Fujitsu product line is vastly unchanged aside from testing to the new standards.\u201d He noted the company\u2019s heat pumps historically have exceeded the minimum standards. Fujitsu is promoting a split terminal heat pump HVAC series as a way of improving energy output and cost efficiencies, which provides what Stinson defined as a \u201cgreat solution\u201d to renovations of PTAC-style units. \u201cOur STHP is designed to fit in traditional through-the-wall PTAC installations and is well-suited for renovations,\u201d he said. \u201cNew construction offers greater flexibility in equipment styles and potential zoning.\u201d Equipment and installation likely will cost more than PTAC units and will vary by project as will the payback period, said Stinson, but he stressed, \u201cThe increased comfort and noise reduction will result in immediate guest satisfaction.\u201d Recognizing the need for hotels and commercial properties to have more-compact, easy-to-install and maintain and high-performing solutions to meet rigorous standards for indoor air quality without the need for large, complex systems, Friedrich developed a closet-mounted variable refrigerant package line based on inverter technology that controls compressor motor speed to continuously regulate the temperature. This, Adams said, delivers \u201call those benefits plus is extremely efficient and quiet.\u201d Additionally, the technology behind VRP inspired the company to introduce its FreshAire PTAC in 2018, based on the same innovations, with the ultimate goal of giving hoteliers a wide range of options to improve indoor air quality, including promoting VTACs via its proprietary self-contained Vert-I-Pak. \u201cHoteliers remain very enthusiastic for the new technology; however, it does require a different mentality starting from design, up to and including guest operation,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAll too often we see initial product inquiries and purchase focus solely on upfront equipment cost, a PTAC mindset if you will. Times have changed and now when it comes to in-room comfort and air conditioning, the questions need to go far beyond whether a system will heat and cool effectively and how much it costs.\u201d Key Questions Some of the key questions owners need to ask, said Adams, include: How efficient is it to operate? Will it improve indoor air quality? Will it address issues such as humidity? Is it simple to install and maintain? Can it precisely adjust to the needs of individual guests to deliver better comfort? Is it quiet and easy to operate? Does the manufacturer stand behind the products and how easy is it to get customer service support? How does installation differ from a traditional PTAC? Adams did note cost range varies based on many project-specific factors \u201cbut new vertical package product installation is generally about double the cost of PTAC. Fully featured VPAK installations will be higher.\u201d METUS supports VRF technology\u2014it introduced its City Multi line in 2002\u2014as a way of improving the current and future environment. \u201cAs an all-electric heating and cooling technology, VRF systems can help hotels reduce or eliminate on-site fossil-fuel emissions and cut energy usage. This contributes to cleaner air and simplifies hotel compliance with local sustainability laws and requirements,\u201d Varga said, citing the company\u2019s two new products: the Hybrid VRF two-pipe VRF zoning system designed to use water instead of refrigerant in occupied spaces and Heat2O, an all-electric, heat pump domestic-hot-water heating system. Varga said any size hotel can capitalize on the use of all-climate heat pumps or VRF systems. \u201cHistorically, PTACs have been viewed as a low-cost solution, but hotels will benefit from considering the total value and experience VRF systems provide. Upscale and luxury hotels, in particular, will want to look beyond the mechanical bid and upfront costs to assess how VRF technology can limit the cost and hassle of guest comfort complaints, improve sustainability and energy bills, and reduce the need for structural steel and facade modifications in new construction. Additionally, there are rebates and tax credits available through the Inflation Reduction Act to offset part of the project\u2019s cost,\u201d he said. While there can be challenges in changing up systems, particularly with renovations and making optional choices fit the existing footprint with minimal accommodation costs, Fujitsu\u2019s Stinson said hoteliers are receptive to discuss HVAC technology that will improve the guest experience with improved comfort and reduced noise. \u201cIf this technology can come at a reasonable installation price and provide a payback, there is interest to explore the possibilities,\u201d he said.","filter_flag":1}

Real estate professionals who understand sustainable design philosophies become trusted sources that their clients can rely on past the transaction. The word \"sustainable\" is an all-encompassing idea that breaks down into many parts. It could refer to anything from a product made with environmentally-friendly materials to a lifestyle that minimizes one\u2019s carbon footprint. Within the overarching sustainability movement are specific philosophies that seek to solve the various issues facing the environment today. Circular design is one such specific philosophy that focuses on creating d\u00e9cor, fixtures and spaces with extended life cycles, thus reducing waste. \"In contrast to linear design, in which a material is designed, built, used, and discarded, circular design seeks to extend the lifetime of a material by ensuring multiple uses ...\" explains Mackenzie Collier, interior designer and founder of Mackenzie Collier Interiors in Phoenix, Ariz. \"In circular design,\" she adds, \"a product is designed to simplify future reuse or recycling.\" Circular Design 101 First things first: Circular design is not an aesthetic style. Unlike biophilic design or Art Deco, this refers to the philosophy and intention behind a product or space. \"In a circular model, materials and products enjoy endless, closed-loop lifecycles as they ... are reused, recycled, upcycled and transformed into new products and materials,\" says Laurence Carr, interior architect and designer, founder, and CEO of Laurence Carr, Inc. in New York, N.Y. In other words, waste is designed out of the equation. One example of circular design are bathroom tiles made from recycled materials, which are designed to be recycled again. The Difference Between Circular Design and Sustainable Design Circular design and sustainable design go hand in hand. Carr and Collier describe the first as a type or extension of the second. \"Sustainable design is mainly focused on reducing harm,\" explains Carr. \"Circular design is about reducing harm and reversing it to create a positive impact.\" Another way to think about it: Sustainable design minimizes the environmental impact of making a product in the first place. Circular design considers both the present and future sustainability of the materials. For Collier, incorporating circular design into the home is a natural part of a sustainable lifestyle. Homeowners who care about minimizing environmental impact will also feel drawn to circular design. How Homeowners Can Incorporate Circular Design Both design experts prefer not to call circular design a \"trend.\" Collier says it's just a good, environmentally aware practice \u2014 and it's not going away anytime soon. Depending on the client and project, circular design might look like a combination of several of the following: Going vintage. \"This way, our clients get something different than what everyone else is picking up at West Elm or Crate and Barrel this season,\" Collier says. \"It creates a gathered-over-time aesthetic, is often more cost-conscious, AND is the more environmentally sustainable choice.\" \"This way, our clients get something different than what everyone else is picking up at West Elm or Crate and Barrel this season,\" Collier says. \"It creates a gathered-over-time aesthetic, is often more cost-conscious, AND is the more environmentally sustainable choice.\" Prioritizing recycled and recyclable products. In circular design, it's essential to do everything possible to eliminate waste. One way to do that? Recycling. Collier suggests buying from companies with recycling programs (like FLOR recyclable carpet tiles) or products made from recycled materials.

Collier suggests buying from companies with recycling programs (like FLOR recyclable carpet tiles) or products made from recycled materials. Getting pickier about building materials. For Carr, that means using certified and reclaimed woods for flooring. It also looks like using sustainable materials such as bamboo, cork or biomaterial derived from waste.

Sourcing \"forever\" pieces. This could mean quality pieces from local artists or timeless furniture styles that are made to last. Today's circularity-minded clients are turning away from flashy trends and toward homes and products that are made to stand the test of time. This could mean quality pieces from local artists or timeless furniture styles that are made to last. Today's circularity-minded clients are turning away from flashy trends and toward homes and products that are made to stand the test of time. Reimagining the home structure itself. Homeowner clients will probably have an easier time using circular designs during room refreshes or renovations. But for those looking to build, Carr points to prefabricated homes. \"[They're] created with a focus on energy efficiency and durability, able to be disassembled and repurposed at the end of their useful life,\" she says. Circular Design Resources for Clients Infusing a house with circular design takes time. It happens product by product, room by room. So, where should you and your clients start? Third-party certifications, says Carr. That means looking for products and materials verified as sustainable or circular. Here are some of the third-party stamps of approval Carr looks for: \"The built environment generates nearly 50% of annual global CO2 emissions \u2026,\" says Carr. \"Any small efforts we can each make in our own lives add up in a big way, so please do keep circularity at the top of mind whenever making decisions about your home and lifestyle!\"","filter_flag":1}

The report, titled Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: A Guide to Corporate Climate Action, notes that a revenue opportunity of USD$4.3 trillion is available for Asian businesses by 2030 from activities like the expansion of renewable power, energy efficiency in buildings, and greater circularity in producing industries, making up a 43% share of the global total. Similarly, 58% of the jobs required to service those opportunities will be situated in Asia, creating as many as 232 million roles for the region. \u201cAsia is key on the journey towards net zero,\u201d said Gim Huay Neo, Managing Director, Centre for Nature and Climate, World Economic Forum. \u201cAsia accounts for 51% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. More than half of annual emissions are from industries like electricity, manufacturing, and land use. Business has a strong role in cutting emissions and climate action. To scale, accelerate, and sustain efforts, business needs to collaborate with government and communities, harness innovation, and build partnerships across their value chains.\u201d The whitepaper makes clear the impact of inaction on Asia. Beyond the widespread environmental and individual impact, the report notes extreme climate change is expected to drastically affect Asian economies. Based on a severe increase of 3.2\u00b0C by 2050, Asia is projected to see a reduction in GDP by over 26%. Southeast Asia is predicted to experience a GDP reduction of 37%\u2014by far the worst around the globe. \u201cThe business case for climate action is clear,\u201d said Paul Marriott, APJ President at SAP. \u201cWe know that 50% of Asian businesses believe addressing environmental issues will be material to business results within the next five years. Organizations who ignore or hedge their climate strategies gamble their ethics, revenues, and competitive advantage.\u201d \u201cUnmitigated climate change is the biggest threat of our generation. The world economy could lose more than 18% of current GDP if no action on climate change is taken. And the impact would be significantly higher in Asia, at almost 26%,\u201d said Neeraj Aggarwal, Chair, BCG Asia-Pacific. \u201cAt the same time, Asia is at a pivotal juncture in its history, where beyond its vulnerability, it also represents the biggest economic opportunity for global climate action. The time is right for Asian leaders to make bold strides for the good of their businesses, and the world.\u201d The preliminary findings of Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: A Guide to Corporate Climate Action were discussed during a session at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos-Klosters earlier this year. \u201cThe Net-Zero challenge requires urgent public-private co-operation on a global scale. The Forum engages and builds multi-stakeholder platforms to scale and accelerate the climate and nature agenda,\u201d said Gim Huay Neo. \u201cOnly through fostering trust and collaboration can we safeguard our global commons and secure a net zero, nature positive and better living future for all of us and generations to come.\u201d More information and the full Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: Your Guide to Corporate Climate Action report is available here.

Machineries that can perform better with less power are therefore crucial to overcoming today\u2019s greatest challenges.To understand how organisations are approaching energy efficiency, ABB recently conducted a survey of 250 of India\u2019s leading industrial and commercial decision-makers. The same survey was also conducted in other countries, including the US, China, and Brazil. Data from all 2,300 global decision-makers has been compiled in the ABB Energy Insights Survey Report 2023. The conclusions of this research could possibly set off alarm bells for business leaders and policymakers. However, the good news is that practical solutions to increase energy efficiency are now easily available, more accessible and affordable. Here is what Indian businesses need to know.Energy is the top operating expense for many industrial businesses and a significant expense for several other kinds of businesses. On average, it represents 34 per cent of a business\u2019s operating costs \u2013 and for a quarter of businesses (26 percent), it accounts for more than half of their operating cost.82 percent of Indian decision-makers consider rising energy costs to be \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018moderate\u2019 threat to their business profitability. As compared to the global average, businesses in India are slightly more concerned about the energy crisis with 74 per cent business leaders considering it a threat to profitability.Nine in ten Indian business leaders (92.2 per cent) are also concerned about the availability, reliability and security of the energy supply. The most common concerns are further price increases (42 per cent), power cuts or blackouts (40 per cent), and energy rationing or supply interruptions (34 per cent).In turn, business leaders expect rising energy costs to affect other areas of business, with potential. Many plan to reduce spending elsewhere (39 per cent) or cut production (31 per cent), while over a third (36 per cent) expect to pass price rises on to the consumer. Around a quarter are also considering delaying the launch of new products or services (25 per cent) or moving production to a country with cheaper energy (24 per cent).If energy prices remain high over the next three to five years, businesses expect to reduce spending on other essential areas. Cuts will include recruitment (42 per cent); salaries, overtime and bonuses (38 per cent); training (37 per cent); and research and development (22 per cent).There is another significant ripple effect we cannot afford: a delay in sustainability and carbon neutrality plans. Six in ten (58 per cent) expressed that rising energy costs will delay them from meeting their emissions goals by one to five years.Every part of society must play its role in achieving Net Zero emissions, but industrial businesses must take the lead. Globally, industry accounts for more than half of total greenhouse gas emissions. The scale of the sector means that even small changes made by industry, therefore, can have a huge collective impact. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), however, the industry is already \u2018not on track\u2019 to achieve Net Zero, so further delays are unacceptable.Clearly, the energy crisis has significant consequences in terms of competitiveness, growth, employment, and sustainability. As a result, businesses are looking to energy efficiency to enable them to use energy more effectively. Almost half of the decision-makers (49 per cent) have increased investment in improving energy efficiency, and more than one in four (28 per cent) have undertaken an efficiency audit.Industrial businesses, for example, can benefit greatly from upgrading equipment such as electric motors. Globally, industrial electric motors consume 45 per cent of all power produced. Replacing a 20-year-old motor with a modern solution reduces its energy consumption by up to 30 percent.Upgrading to equipment with best-in-class energy efficiency has clear business benefits. Considering the motor example, today\u2019s energy prices mean that the payback period is under 18 months. Further, most of a motor\u2019s total cost of ownership (TCO) goes toward the power to operate it throughout its lifetime. This means that continuing to use old, less efficient motors rather than paying the upfront cost of a new model is \u2018penny wise, pound foolish.\u2019Efficiency is also better for the planet. Using less energy to achieve a task reduces the emissions associated with it. If every industrial electric motor-driven system worldwide was replaced with optimised, high-efficiency equipment, global energy consumption would drop by 10 percent. This is why the IEA calls efficiency the \u2018first fuel\u2019 in reducing emissions.In 2021, ABB launched the Energy Efficiency Movement. This forum of more than 320 businesses from around the world, including over 120 from India, supports research, shares innovations, and leads by example on energy efficiency.Organisations of all kinds \u2013 including industry, academia, and the public sector \u2013 are encouraged to join the movement. All they need to do is commit to reducing their energy usage, CO2 emissions, or both. Together, we can create a more energy-efficient, sustainable and prosperous world.If you want to join the Energy Efficiency Movement today, click here.The article has been contributed by Tarak Mehta, President, Motion Business Area, ABB.","filter_flag":1}

Con Edison is investing in a range of clean energy technologies and projects to support New York's goal of a net-zero statewide economy by 2050, including transmission lines, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, heat pumps, energy efficiency and battery storage. \"As New York's largest energy-delivery company, we're investing in clean energy infrastructure that will help the state meet its ambitious climate goals,\" said Tim Cawley, Con Edison's chairman and chief executive. \"I'm proud of the progress we've made building a workforce that's reflective of the communities we serve, passionate about our role in the clean energy transition, and equipped to meet the big challenges ahead.\" Delivering Renewable Power in New York New York's target of 70 percent renewable power by 2030 requires new transmission lines that will carry energy generated by offshore wind turbines, solar panels and other clean sources to the customers who need it. In 2022, Con Edison began building the Reliable Clean City project, a major transmission upgrade that will deliver large amounts of power to New York City's outer boroughs while helping enable the retirement of local fossil fuel plants in environmental justice communities. The first portion of the project, in Queens, is due for completion this year, with two additional sections in Brooklyn and Staten Island due for completion in 2025. In early 2023, Con Edison finalized the sale of its renewable energy development subsidiary, known as the Clean Energy Businesses, to RWE Renewables America. The sale allows Con Edison to intensify its focus on its home state of New York, where its investments and expertise have the biggest impact. Replacing Fossil Fuel Heaters with Electric Heat Pumps The gas distribution system plays a key role in New York's energy system today, keeping homes and businesses warm and providing fuel for cooking in many buildings. However, Con Edison expects its deliveries of fossil natural gas will decline significantly in the years ahead, even as demand for electricity rises with the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Con Edison is supporting New York's transition away from fossil heating systems. The company has incentivized the installation of heat pumps and other clean heat technologies in more than 24,000 buildings to date, with a goal of helping to electrify 150,000 buildings by 2030. Solar on Rooftops, Electric Vehicles on Roads The shift to electric vehicles is accelerating in New York and will play a critical role in the state's plan to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edison's PowerReady incentive program is among the largest of its kind in the nation, offering utility support for EV charging infrastructure. Just two years after its establishment, PowerReady has already supported more than 2,600 charge points, with a goal of 19,000 by 2025 \u2013 and 400,000 by 2035. Solar energy is another market that is growing rapidly in the New York City region. Con Edison's customers in New York City, Westchester, Orange and Rockland counties have installed more than 60,000 solar systems to date totaling 700 megawatts of capacity, adding significant clean generation capacity. To complement New York's growing base of distributed energy resources, Con Edison has installed smart meters across nearly its entire customer base. Smart meters allow customers to track their energy usage in near-real time while giving Con Edison deeper insight into its electric network, improving system efficiency and reducing the impact of service outages. Nurturing a Diverse Workforce Con Edison provided financial support to more than 600 nonprofit organizations in 2022, with a focus on groups supporting environmental stewardship and STEM education. The company has begun taking a more systematic approach to protecting and restoring biodiversity in the ecosystems in which it works and operates infrastructure, and recently issued a Biodiversity Action Plan. In addition to highlighting Con Edison's clean energy and climate efforts, this year's report includes new sections on topics such as environmental justice, biodiversity protection, human rights, and a deeper focus on community and stakeholder engagement. Con Edison remains steadfast in its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and the company's teams are becoming more diverse \u2013 including the executive team. Employee Resource groups and local DEI Councils are advancing awareness of cultural differences within the company, while helping to recruit and develop the careers of a diverse group of employees. Download and read Con Edison's Annual Sustainability Report Consolidated Edison, Inc. is one of the nation's largest investor-owned energy-delivery companies, with approximately $16 billion in annual revenues and $69 billion in assets as of December 31, 2022. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through the following subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), a regulated utility providing electric service in New York City and New York's Westchester County, gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and parts of Westchester, and steam service in Manhattan; Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), a regulated utility serving customers in a 1,300-square-mile-area in southeastern New York State and northern New Jersey; and Con Edison Transmission, Inc., which falls primarily under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects that will bring clean, renewable electricity to customers, focusing on New York, New England, the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.

During the pandemic period, the company used the opportunity to revamp its lighting with over 900 powerful LED spotlights provided by TRILUX Group's retail lighting expert, OKTALITE. The new lighting design showcases the brand, fashion, and events with less energy consumption and greater intensity. Engelbert Strauss is a family-owned company based in Biebergem\u00fcnd, Hesse, around 50 kilometres from Frankfurt am Main. The brand is renowned for its innovation in new products and presentation of fashion and lifestyle. This spring, it will launch the world's first biodegradable trousers made of banana fibres, showcasing its commitment to sustainability in fashion. The brand will celebrate the launch with several fashion events. According to Thomas Bock, Project Manager at Oktalite, \"a brand can be experienced through light in these stores. Many events take place that attract customers, even from Frankfurt. For such a shopping experience, the lighting must be 100% right. Our new luminaires are power packages with up to 6000 lumens. With them, we effortlessly set strong accents in the room and on surfaces, even from great heights.\" The new lighting design complements the huge shopping landscape with an industrial look, spanning over 2,650 m2. The room height is almost eight metres, and the trapezoidal sheet metal ceiling blurs the boundary between the store and the event hall. The digital \"E.S. Infopoints\" provide in-depth product information via screens. The \"KIDZ Corner\" offers a variety of services for the youngest target group, while mannequins in unusual poses or lofty heights staged with light are eye-catchers on the large area. More than 900 conventional spotlights were replaced with powerful CANILO track-mounted spotlights that are one-third more efficient than HIT solutions. The new LED spotlights were precisely aligned at the height of five meters by experienced specialists from the service team. OKtalite used a slim, compact luminaire design in black. The GRADO floodlight provides concise illumination of displays and graphics on the walls. The overall focus of this project was on greater sustainability, reducing energy consumption from 28.4 W\/m2 to 13.9 W\/m2. The new luminaires were packaged collectively to reduce waste, highlighting the brand's environmentally friendly packaging concepts. Besides the workwear store in Biebergem\u00fcnd, OKTALITE also refurbished the Engelbert Strauss store in Bergkirchen near Munich, prioritising lighting quality and energy efficiency. The brand's commitment to sustainability underscores its focus on providing a pleasant shopping experience and emphasising the merchandise's durability, functionality and robustness. \"The focus in retail is increasingly on efficient lighting quality, good service and environmentally friendly packaging concepts,\" says Thomas Bock.

Climate Change and Environment Industrial Technologies Food and Natural Resources \u00a9 Foreco New wood preservatives are in high demand as companies look for sustainable alternatives to creosote, a toxic chemical known for its use on wooden railway sleepers, electricity poles and in fencing. The EU banned the sale of creosote to citizens in 2003. However, it continues to be widely used by industry due to the lack of appropriate alternatives: other materials such as tropical hardwood, concrete or steel each have their own drawbacks. With creosote due to be banned once and for all in 2020, Foreco wants to step into the fencing market with a sustainable alternative: FaunaWood, combining the durability of tropical hardwood and the availability of concrete poles. We spoke with Adam Turi, Process Engineer at Foreco, to find out more. What is the solution you have come up with? \u201cThe new product uses European pinewood impregnated with a special bio-based resin, developed by our Bio4Products partners, BTG Biomass Technology Group and TransFurans Chemicals. After impregnation, the poles are dried and cured, fixing the resin in the wood. \u201cThe result is a durable, strong wood pole, perfect for various applications. The impregnation ensures the product is not damaged by wood rotting fungi and termites for at least 25 years. \u201cDuring production the poles are processed (debarked and pointed) to the end application, thereby making FaunaWood easy to install and use.\u201d How does this contribute to the circular economy? \u201cPrevious formulations of the FaunaWood resin had been made from sugarcane, but the new resin under development in Bio4Products is produced with plant and wood residues. This makes it possible to reuse an old FaunaWood pole as input for the bio-resin. A 100% circular product!\u201d When might the product be on the market? \u201cWithin Bio4Products we still aim to improve some aspects of the product. \u201cFinding the best resin solution, which can sufficiently penetrate the heartwood part of the pine poles and increase its durability, has been a challenge. Drying and curing optimisation is still under development in order to achieve the fastest loop time of the product. \u201cWe expect that FaunaWood will be available on the market by the end of 2019.\u201d The Bio4Products project receives funding from SPIRE (the Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency public-private partnership), to develop renewable alternatives to fossil-based processing streams. Other partners are developing bio-based phenolic resins, insulation foams, and sand moulding and other furan based resins.

(Image: tuwien.at) Li-ion batteries are ubiquitous today, but that does not mean that they are the best solution for all areas of application. A team at TU Wien (Vienna) has developed an oxygen-ion battery that has some important advantages: It does not allow for quite as high energy densities as a Li-ion battery, but its storage capacity does not decrease irrevocably over time: it can be regenerated and thus may enable an extremely long service life. Plus, the oxygen-ion batteries can be produced without rare elements and are made of incombustible materials. The new battery, which uses ceramic materials, could be an excellent solution for large energy storage systems, e.g., storing electrical energy from renewable sources. \u201cWe have had a lot of experience with ceramic materials that can be used for fuel cells for quite some time,\u201d said TU Wien\u2019s Alexander Schmid. \u201cThat gave us the idea of investigating whether such materials might also be suitable for making a battery.\u201d The ceramic materials studied can absorb and release doubly negatively charged oxygen ions. When a voltage is applied, the oxygen ions migrate from one ceramic material to another, after which they can be made to migrate back again \u2014 generating electric current. \u201cThe basic principle is actually very similar to the Li-ion battery,\u201d said Professor J\u00fcrgen Fleig. \u201cBut our materials have some important advantages.\u201d One of the main advantages being that ceramics are not flammable \u2014 so fire accidents are practically ruled out. Also, there is no need for rare elements. \u201cIn this respect, the use of ceramic materials is a great advantage because they can be adapted very well,\u201d said Tobias Huber. \u201cYou can replace certain elements that are difficult to obtain with others relatively easily.\u201d The battery prototype still uses lanthanum \u2014 an element that is not exactly rare but not completely common either. However, even lanthanum is to be replaced by something cheaper, and such research is already underway. Cobalt and nickel \u2014 found in many batteries \u2014 are not used at all. Left to right: Professor J\u00fcrgen Fleig, Tobias Huber, Alexander Schmid. (Image: tuwien.at) Arguably the most important advantage of the oxygen-ion battery is its potential longevity. \u201cIn many batteries, you have the problem that at some point the charge carriers can no longer move,\u201d said Schmid. \u201cThen they can no longer be used to generate electricity, the capacity of the battery decreases. After many charging cycles, that can become a serious problem.\u201d The oxygen-ion battery, however, can be regenerated without any problems; if oxygen is lost due to side reactions, then the loss can simply be compensated for by oxygen from the ambient air. The new battery is not intended for smartphones or electric cars, because the oxygen-ion battery only achieves about a third of the energy density that one is used to from Li-ion batteries and runs at temperatures between 200 \u00b0C - 400 \u00b0C. The technology is a boon for storing energy, though. \u201cIf you need a large energy storage unit to temporarily store solar or wind energy, for example, the oxygen-ion battery could be an excellent solution,\u201d said Schmid. \u201cIf you construct an entire building full of energy storage modules, the lower energy density and increased operating temperature do not play a decisive role. But the strengths of our battery would be particularly important there: the long service life, the possibility of producing large quantities of these materials without rare elements, and the fact that there is no fire hazard with these batteries.\u201d Here is a Tech Briefs interview, edited for length and clarity, with Schmid. Tech Briefs: What were the biggest technical challenges you faced? Schmid: One of the major technological challenges was, and partly still is, the sealing of the battery. In order to keep its charge, the storage electrodes need to be isolated from the oxygen in the atmosphere; also, oxygen can leak, and this causes a slow self-discharge of the battery. Getting this sealing to be perfectly oxygen-blocking is challenging, and we are still working on improving its oxygen blocking properties. Tech Briefs: Can you explain in simple terms how the technology works? Schmid: OIBs work by transferring oxygen \u2014 in the form of oxide ions and electrons \u2014 between two oxide electrodes. One of those electrodes can take up oxygen easily, while the other more easily releases oxygen. By applying a voltage, oxygen is \u201cpumped\u201d from the oxygen affine electrode to the less oxygen affine electrode \u2014 the battery gets charged. Then, oxygen \u201cflowing back\u201d can drive an external electronic load \u2014 the battery is discharged. Tech Briefs: The research paper says, \u201c\u2026But even lanthanum is to be replaced by something cheaper, and research into this is already underway.\u201d How is that research going? Any interesting new findings thus far? Schmid: This is a topic of ongoing research, so we can\u2019t eliminate lanthanum, but the preliminary results look promising. Tech Briefs: The paper also says a patent is pending. Potentially, how soon could we see the oxygen-ion battery available? Schmid: This is really hard to estimate. I expect at least 10 years until the technology is ready for large scale commercial application. Tech Briefs: Are there any set plans for even further research\/testing? What are your next steps? Schmid: Yes, we will continue to work on this topic, both with a basic research approach and also with a more application focused approach.","filter_flag":1}

But in the mountains that surround the Las Vegas Valley, a quiet desert escape takes form where the ceaseless glow of the Sin City strip doesn\u2019t reach. The McCullough Range\u2014home to the luxury community of Ascaya\u2014is pristine and peaceful, a high sentinel overlooking the city but taking no part in its bustling culture. Design Inspiration for The New American Home 2023 On a half-acre lot nestled within the red rock landscape, The New American Home 2023, the 39th in a series of annual showcase homes built in the host city of the International Builders\u2019 Show, achieves the best of both worlds. Designed and built by Michael Gardner, AIA, principal of Luxus Design Build and founder of Studio g Architecture, the 8,200-square-foot, two-level, four-bedroom home, named \"Byron Bay,\" is a perfect blend of fun and functional design. Its elevated location overlooking the valley inspired the home\u2019s orientation and, ultimately, its one-of-a-kind floor plan, which bridges comfortable interior spaces with breezy outdoor living areas. \u201cThe most interesting and unique features of the home started with the site selection and were brought to life through the floor plan,\u201d Gardner says. That meant using the topography and natural materials as a guide for the home\u2019s construction and design. For instance, the southeast side of the property features an impressive rock outcropping, while the north side delivers a panoramic view of the Las Vegas Strip. \u201cWe design from the outside in when it comes to materiality,\u201d Gardner says, \u201cso that even when you\u2019re in the home, you feel like you\u2019re outside.\u201d Project Specs: Byron Bay Location: Ascaya Luxury Community, Henderson, Nev. Builder: Luxus Design Build, Las Vegas Architect: Studio g Architecture Size: 8,200 square feet Beds: 4 Baths: 5.5 Photos: Joel Gamble, Klassick Vizion Studios Outdoor Spaces That Live Large Nowhere is serenity better embraced in this year\u2019s New American Home than in its expansive outdoor living areas, from a zen-like open-air courtyard at the home\u2019s entry to a sprawling 2,000-square-foot deck and patio space along the back of the house. Providing opportunities for indoor\/outdoor living was a must for Gardner, who designed the home\u2019s floor plan to not only take advantage of the property\u2019s prime location, but also its balmy weather. To seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living spaces, he opted for 10-foot-tall sliding glass doors in multiple living areas that maximize the home\u2019s stunning views and bring fresh air into the open-concept floor plan. Those floor-to-ceiling doors are best showcased in the great room, where a 45-foot run of glass opens into the covered pool deck encompassing a kitchen, dining area, and lounge. The home\u2019s infinity pool flows into a lap pool along the property\u2019s lower perimeter\u2014a functional solution that utilizes the lot\u2019s gradual slope. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the great room, it feels like you\u2019re outside because of how much light we brought in with the expansive use of glass,\u201d he says. With those doors open, the indoor dining room and main kitchen open up to the outdoors entirely, blurring the line and making them part of the outdoor experience\u2014an effect also seen in the game room and in the owner\u2019s bedroom. \u201cThe interior pairs this very simple, clean design with a complexity in what those spaces can actually do,\u201d Gardner adds. Not only is the home\u2019s interior design influenced by the property\u2019s natural environment, but the outdoor spaces themselves required some creative engineering to work with the sloped lot. A two-tier, infinity-edge pool running along the lower perimeter of the backyard is the centerpiece of the home\u2019s outdoor living spaces; it\u2019s also a perfect example of site-specific design. Most infinity-edge pools require a big trough in which the water spills over before being cycled back into the pool basin, but the Luxus team flipped that traditional idea on its head and decided to make the trough a lap pool. \u201cBy doing so, we not only created a unique solution to the lot\u2019s topography,\u201d Gardner says, \u201cbut we also gave function to something that was needed.\u201d \u201cWe design from the outside in when it comes to materiality, so that even when you\u2019re in the home, you feel like you\u2019re outside.\u201d \u2014Michael Gardner, architect and builder By adding spacious cooking functions and seating areas as well as access to a full outdoor bathroom to the poolside patio and an upper deck, Gardner increased year-round livability for homeowners even beyond the home\u2019s conditioned square footage. But those aren\u2019t the only outdoor additions that make the home live larger. The side yard, Gardner says, is traditionally overlooked in the design process, but not in this home: All but one of the home\u2019s four bedrooms have private access to covered patios and balconies running along the property\u2019s western perimeter, each equipped with its own outdoor fireplace and seating area. \u201cOutdoor living really just extends habitable spaces,\u201d Gardner says, \u201cand while a lot of people turn their back on side yards, we opted to highlight a couple of those locations to create really cool covered patio spaces the homeowners can actually use.\u201d Indoor\/outdoor living was one of the most important considerations for the Luxus Design Build team, which is why they chose to allocate so much of the property\u2019s square footage to spacious outdoor living areas, such as the covered pool deck (above). RELATED Floor Plan The design\/build team for The New American Home 2023 maximized a half-acre lot space in the Ascaya development with showstopping outdoor living areas such as a two-tiered infinity pool [1] and covered pool deck [2] overlooking the Las Vegas Strip. The home\u2019s lower level is designed to both entertain guests and to provide a level of functionality for homeowners with fun spaces like the game room [3], and quieter areas such as a private bedroom [4] complete with its own laundry [5], another guest bedroom with access to a private patio [6], and a quiet home office [7]. The open-concept great room encompasses a cozy living area [8], an indoor\/outdoor dining area [9], and a sleek, modern kitchen [10] that leads into a roomy four-car garage [11]. The centerpiece of the home\u2019s second floor is the owner\u2019s suite [12], which includes a private lounge space, a wet bar, and a wraparound deck with sweeping views of the valley below. Next door is a spa-like bathroom [13] that flows into the primary closet [14] and a large laundry room [15]. At the end of the upstairs hallway is another bright, spacious guest bedroom [16] tucked away from the home\u2019s primary entertainment spaces. The rooftop deck [17] is one of the most noteworthy parts of the home\u2019s layout. It offers some of the property\u2019s best views and includes a seating area, a bar, and an outdoor kitchen. Fashion Meets Functionality While the home pays homage to the lively culture surrounding it, it also offers a laid-back getaway for homeowners and their guests. That blend of recreation and practicality is another core tenet of the floor plan, which Gardner carefully crafted to make even large entertainment spaces feel homey and comfortable. \u201cFrom the house, you\u2019re able to look down on the Strip and visually connect to this chaos that ensues in Las Vegas,\u201d he says. But despite the home\u2019s enviable view of the always-on lights of the Strip and connection to the city, Gardner says that tumultuous energy needs to be left in the valley below. \u201cYour home is your sanctuary. It\u2019s your place to decompress.\u201d From 23 feet up, the large windows surrounding the home\u2019s great room admit an abundance of natural light, making the already spacious areas, such as the living room, dining room, and kitchen, feel even larger. Nowhere is that sense of refuge and respite more evident than in the owner\u2019s suite, where a bird\u2019s eye view of the valley is framed by a corner wall of intersecting sliding glass doors, the same ones Gardner used as the centerpiece of the living room. The bedroom space is divided by an accent wall from an adjacent bar and lounge area that takes its design cues from flashier parts of the home, while offering a separate and private sense of peace and simplicity. \u201cThe home\u2019s design was framed around this feeling of comfort and a subdued, understated elegance,\u201d Gardner says, in contrast with the world of nonstop entertainment in Vegas. \u201cWe designed the home so you can have multiple different microscopic or macroscopic catering locations, but so you can also create a level of functionality, depending on how you entertain.\u201d \u201cThe interior pairs this very simple, clean design with a complexity in what those spaces can actually do.\u201d \u2014Michael Gardner, architect and builder That duality is achieved in areas like the game room, which pairs a wet bar and a billiards table with a cozy lounge area for low-key movie nights. Along with fun escapes, the lower level also includes a home office that\u2019s removed from other activity, with a private, soundproof work space that has acoustic panels behind the walls. Up a staircase that wraps an elevator and is illuminated by a custom light display, the second floor is another prime example of stylish, practical design. A large landing overlooks the primary living space and leads into an interconnected laundry room, primary closet space, and primary suite bathroom, where relaxation takes priority, with a built-in aspen wood sauna, a two-person shower, and a soaking tub. Creating a sense of home was paramount for Gardner, so much so that the property\u2019s name, Byron Bay, takes inspiration from his own roots. \u201cMy family is from Australia, and Byron Bay is a prime destination to retreat from city life,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what this house is really intended to do. You\u2019re adjacent, but you\u2019re not there. You\u2019re close, and you can see the city, but you\u2019re in your own private haven.\u201d With 45 feet of sliding glass doors along its rear elevation, the home\u2019s spacious open floor plan is designed for entertaining. The living room includes a wet bar, a marbled quartz fireplace, and integrated speakers built into the surrounding walls. The game room is a playful getaway that pairs a wet bar and billiards table with a film screening area and private outdoor patio for the ideal mix of leisure and comfort. In the owner\u2019s suite, a backlit accent wall divides the space into two distinct living areas. On one side is a cozy lounge space equipped with a full wet bar and an entertainment center, and on the other is a peaceful, resort-like bedroom. Big House, Big Tech, Big Savings Throughout its 39-year history, The New American Home has served as both a model of inspiring architectural design and lifestyle ideas as well as a showcase for innovations in technology and energy efficiency. The 2023 exhibition home is no exception. On the tech side, the entire house is equipped with a smart home system that controls everything from the owner\u2019s suite shower to the living room fireplace. \u201cPretty much the whole home can be monitored and controlled remotely,\u201d says architect-builder Michael Gardner. Homeowners can adjust the fireplaces, TVs, speakers, and the thermostat to customize audio, lighting, and temperature from a mobile device, which also allows the owner to better understand all aspects of the home\u2019s energy use. \u201cHomes are becoming very technologically driven,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t just help with accessibility, it also gives homeowners a better understanding of how they\u2019re using their utilities.\u201d While the owners of this $13.5 million home might not be overly concerned with their monthly utility bills, they may have an interest in sustainability. As such, Gardner\u2019s team collaborated with Two Trails, a national green-building consultancy, to achieve impressive levels of energy, water, and other resource efficiencies to reduce the home\u2019s carbon footprint. The structure\u2019s climate-specific thermal shell not only significantly lowers the home\u2019s energy load, but the right-sized, 20-kilowatt rooftop solar array helps achieve a net-zero energy-use balance and a Home Energy Rating Index of \u201315.

Interroll Presents High Performance Conveyor Platform for Courier, Express and Parcel Service Providers Following the example of its globally successful Modular Conveyor Platform (MCP), Interroll is launching a modular conveyor solution that meets the specific robustness and throughput requirements of courier, express and parcel (CEP) service providers. The new High Performance Conveyor Platform (HPP)\u2014a powerful addition to Interroll's sortation solutions in particular\u2014can significantly increase large and small distribution centers\u2019 productivity, capacity and energy efficiency. As part of Interroll's comprehensive platform strategy, the HPP primarily uses proven technical products that have already proved themselves hundreds of thousands of times with users. The new offering will be on display for the first time from April 25\u201327, 2023, at Interroll's LogiMAT trade fair stand (Hall 1, Stand K41) in Stuttgart, Germany, where visitors will also be able to experience the company's platform strategy for material flow solutions in a playful way. The popularity of online shopping is generating an ever-increasing quantity and variety of goods that need to be transported and sorted in the distribution networks of CEP service providers worldwide. The number of parcels processed by corresponding conveyor and sorting systems in the largest 13 countries is set to rise from 159 billion in 2021 to 256 billion in 2027. Interroll\u2019s automatic sortation solutions have played a key role in mastering these material-handling challenges for over 20 years. More than 500 sorters have been deployed globally by industry leaders such as Amazon, DHL, FedEx, UPS, Hugo Boss, Inditex (ZARA) and Zalando as well as postal services. \"For our innovation course, we have been consistently leveraging the benefits of our platform strategy for many years. The latest example is the new High Performance Conveyor Platform (HPP), which we developed based on our many years of industry expertise in the CEP market. It offers system integrators and courier, express and parcel service providers important additional value in achieving their business goals,\" explains Jens Str\u00fcwing, Executive Vice President Products & Technology at Interroll. \"In addition to the maximum flexibility and proven product quality of this modular system of freely combinable conveyor modules, these are above all the energy efficiency, ease of use and speed with which automation projects can be implemented. In combination with a corresponding service offer, productivity in large and small parcel centers can be significantly increased in this way\u2014for new installations, but also for retrofit projects.\" Fast project implementation through digital processes The Interroll Layouter can be used, for example, to clearly design and plan complete HPP system concepts on a computer and implement them virtually. The solution drastically reduces the effort, planning time and, therefore, project duration. It also makes for more informative and greatly simplified presentations and decision-making processes for users. At the same time, the standardized modules reduce the time required for installing and implementing solutions. What\u2019s more, the seamless processing of data from the Interroll Layouter in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at production sites enables short delivery times. As with Interroll sorters, customers are supported with consistent and agile project management. The new conveyor platform consists of a large number of standardized line and curve modules that can be freely combined to meet the respective customer requirements. These include, for example, straight conveyor modules and modules for inclines and declines. The rigidity has been increased by one-third compared to the MCP. The robustness of the platform allows loads of up to 50 kilograms per meter, while the maximum conveying speed is 2.5 meters per second. Depending on the dimensioning and the goods transported, a throughput of up to 10,000 units per hour is possible. The solution can process a huge range of goods to be sorted, including cardboard boxes, small packages, padded envelopes, manila envelopes and polybags. Energy-efficient drive technology, simple start-up and maintenance Depending on customer needs, conveyors based on this platform are driven by gear or drum motors, which offer an efficiency of around 90% and enable a quiet and productive working environment with very high throughputs. When using conveyor lines with a central drive, the belt is tensioned from just one side, which significantly simplifies startup and maintenance. The design of the side guides is also well thought out in terms of construction. Thanks to their symmetrical and modular structure, they use only a few standardized components for the left and right conveyor sides. In addition, the overlapping design creates closed transitions from one conveyor line to the next, preventing transported goods from getting stuck at the transitions. Module integrates conveying and sorting The functional core of the HPP is the innovative Interroll Multibelt Switch (MBS). The module combines conveying and sorting functions in a unique way. By seamlessly overlaying the straight-line and lateral movements, the conveying goods are diverted onto additional conveyor lines at a constant speed in the conveyor either straight ahead or on two sides. This method ensures not only a gentle and safe transport process, but also a very high speed and throughput values of over 10,000 units per hour. With the Interroll MBS, customers can further increase the capacity of their distribution centers through a higher degree of automation, based on the High Performance Conveyor Platform. This applies not only to conveying presorted goods in the direction of or behind large sorting systems, such as those used in major distribution centers; even in smaller, customer-oriented package centers with few destinations now being constructed in many places, the automation solution can greatly increase work productivity and economic efficiency. In addition, the MBS can be used as a gateway to automatic sorting for applications that need only a few destinations. The HPP will go into production in Europe in the second quarter of 2023, and in America and Asia in 2024.

But can farmers really deliver on this groundbreaking deal? As global temperatures continue to rise, it\u2019s essential that all sectors do their part in achieving sustainability goals. Farmers have a unique opportunity to drive meaningful change \u2013 but only if they are given the tools they need to meet the challenge head-on. In this article, we explore what it will take for farmers to become part of the green transformation that\u2019s needed at an unprecedented scale if Europe is to reach its net zero emissions target by 2050. We\u2019ll look at what new technologies, strategies and incentives might be required for them to succeed in meeting these demands. EU Green Deal is a groundbreaking initiative to transform the way we interact with our environment The deal aims to decarbonise the economy while also creating jobs, improving health outcomes and protecting nature at the same time. To accomplish these goals, it advances legislation regarding renewable energy sources, sustainable transport systems and green building standards. In addition, it supports research into new technologies, such as carbon capture storage or green hydrogen production, which can help mitigate some of our current environmental issues. To ensure success, everyone must work together \u2013 governments, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens alike. Farmers are particularly important players in making progress towards meeting the EU\u2019s sustainability goals. As they own much of Europe\u2019s agricultural land, their actions will have far-reaching implications for how we use resources today and in the future. This includes reducing harmful inputs like fertilisers and pesticides; conserving water through improved irrigation practices; rotating crops more often; increasing organic matter content in soils; restoring wetlands; planting trees; managing livestock responsibly; encouraging pasture biodiversity, and more. Overview of the EU Green Deal environmental commitments The EU\u2019s Green Deal brings with it a range of environmental commitments and goals, including: the promotion of sustainable agriculture; green infrastructure; circular economy; environmental conservation; and organic farming practices. Sustainable agriculture is about reducing agricultural emissions while still producing enough food to meet human needs. This can be achieved through improved agroecological systems that are more resilient to climate change and use fewer resources. Regarding green infrastructure, the EU wants to promote natural habitats such as wetlands and forests, which help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Furthermore, they aim to increase biodiversity by protecting endangered species and promoting wildlife corridors between protected areas. Circular economies are designed to reduce waste production by reusing or recycling materials into new products. The EU has committed to phasing out single-use plastic items and encouraging businesses to invest in greener technologies for manufacturing processes. Finally, environmental conservation efforts focus on preserving natural ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and other bodies of water from pollution caused by heavy industry and urban runoff. Organic farming also plays an important role here since it reduces pesticide usage compared to traditional agriculture methods. Farmers must implement land-use change strategies To meet the environmental commitments of the EU Green Deal, farmers must implement land-use change strategies. These strategies involve a combination of conservation practices that aim to reduce negative environmental impacts and improve sustainability. Establishing agroforestry systems \u2013 Agroforestry is an integrated approach which combines trees with crops or livestock in a mutually beneficial way. This helps create a more diverse, productive and resilient agricultural system. Prioritising green infrastructure \u2013 this involves creating habitats for native species, such as hedgerows and wildflower meadows, which can help increase biodiversity and provide additional sources of food for pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and moths. Promoting crop rotation \u2013 Crop rotation is one of the oldest farming techniques known to man; it involves growing different types of crops in succession over time which can lead to improved soil fertility and pest control while reducing reliance on chemical inputs. Encouraging organic production \u2013 Organic agriculture is a holistic approach which focuses on maintaining healthy soils through reduced tillage, composting and other natural methods without using synthetic fertilisers or pesticides. It also encourages greater diversity regarding plant varieties grown and animal breeds reared, thus increasing long-term resilience against climate change impacts. Soil management techniques Soil is a vital component of the environment, and soil management techniques can ensure farmers deliver on their environmental commitments. One such technique is improving soil fertility. This involves using organic matter, mulch or compost to add nutrients back into the soil that has been depleted due to intensive farming practices. Additionally, it also helps with increasing water retention, which can help protect crops from drought conditions. Another important technique for managing soils is through health management strategies. These involve methods such as crop rotation, cover cropping or intercropping to reduce pest pressures and improve nutrient cycling within the farm system. Healthier soils are better able to retain moisture and provide more beneficial microbial activity, which can further support agricultural productivity. Carbon sequestration is another key area where farmers need to focus when delivering on their environmental commitments. Through various measures such as no-tillage systems or growing legumes, farmers can increase the amount of carbon stored in their soils by reducing erosion and encouraging healthy root growth belowground. In addition, these methods also help reduce fertiliser runoff which can have damaging impacts on nearby ecosystems. Finally, preventing soil erosion should be a priority for all farmers. By implementing conservation agriculture principles such as minimum tillage operations or planting strips of grass between fields, they can maintain surface vegetation that slows down rainwater runoff and prevents topsoil loss while providing additional habitats for wildlife species like pollinators. All these approaches should be taken together with regular monitoring so that any changes over time can be tracked and dealt with accordingly. Agriculture water conservation practices Water conservation strategies are vital for preserving precious resources, as well as protecting aquatic ecosystems from damage caused by pollution or overuse. Farmers can implement water conservation practices, techniques and methods on their land. The most basic practice farmers should adopt is efficient irrigation systems which ensure that crops receive only the amount of water necessary for optimal growth. Additionally, crop rotation will reduce the need for excessive watering due to differences in soil composition between different types of crops. Covering soils with mulch also helps retain moisture and reduces evaporation from the sun\u2019s rays. By taking these steps, farmers can significantly reduce their water usage while ensuring healthy yields and profits. Furthermore, there are several other water conservation programs available to assist farmers in reducing their water footprint even further. For example, some local governments may provide incentives such as grants or tax credits to encourage implementing environmentally friendly practices like using rain barrels or drip irrigation systems. There are also many private organisations working with farmers to develop innovative solutions, such as developing low-cost filtration systems that can capture clean rainwater runoff for use during dry spells. Agricultural biodiversity protection measures Biodiversity protection measures involve protecting plant species, restoring wildlife habitats, undertaking ecosystem restoration projects, and introducing new species into an area through reintroduction programs. These activities all have a positive effect on global ecosystems and provide benefits such as improved air quality, greater water retention in soils, increased carbon sequestration, increased food production, and better disease control. Protecting plant species is essential for maintaining healthy ecological systems; by conserving native plants, we create habitats that support wildlife populations which then promote stability within local environments. Wildlife habitat restoration involves creating more suitable conditions to allow endangered or threatened species to live in their natural environment with adequate resources. Ecosystems restoration projects aim to restore degraded land areas by removing invasive species while planting native vegetation and establishing sustainable practices like agroforestry or integrated farming techniques. Finally, reintroducing extinct or locally rare animal and plant species helps maintain genetic diversity in an area which can lead to the long-term sustainability of whole ecosystems. Climate change mitigation approaches in farming As part of the Green Deal agenda, farmers must implement measures to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting to its effects through resilient agricultural practices. Carbon storage is an important tool in mitigating climate change, as it captures and stores carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration can be achieved through various approaches, including no-till farming, agroforestry, cover crops, organic matter management, and rotational grazing systems. These strategies not only reduce CO2 levels but also help improve soil health and productivity for farmers who use them. Climate adaptation measures are equally essential in tackling the impact of global warming. Sustainable agriculture techniques such as improved irrigation methods, pest control strategies that minimise chemical inputs, and diversified crop rotation cycles have been shown to increase farms\u2019 resilience against extreme weather events caused by climate change. Additionally, investments in technologies like precision agriculture provide farmers with valuable information about their land to better manage water resources and adapt quickly when conditions vary from year to year. Finally, sustainable intensification offers another approach to balancing food production goals with environmental protection objectives in Europe\u2019s changing landscape. Farmers can maximise yields while minimising negative impacts on biodiversity through best management practices such as integrated pest management and nutrient management plans designed for specific soils and sites. These conservation tillage systems cover ground throughout the growing season and enhance biological controls that utilise natural predators instead of chemicals to combat pests or weeds. Renewable energy production guidelines for farmers Farmers must also ensure they adhere to guidelines for producing renewable energy in a sustainable manner. Renewable energy production requires careful planning and monitoring; however, the rewards are well worth the effort. The main benefit is that it does not rely on finite resources such as fossil fuels like coal or oil; instead, it relies on limitless sources such as solar power, wind power, geothermal heat pumps and hydroelectricity. This makes it more cost-effective and reliable than traditional forms of energy production. Additionally, renewable energy has zero emissions which help reduce global warming by preventing pollution from entering the atmosphere. To achieve these goals, countries within the European Union must develop specific standards related to renewable energy production. These standards should provide regulations surrounding how much electricity needs to be generated with renewables each year, what types of technology can be used (i.e., photovoltaic systems), how often maintenance needs to occur and when new installations need to occur for targets to be met efficiently. Furthermore, consideration should also be given toward incentivising farmers who choose alternative methods of generating electricity from their land \u2013 this could include subsidies for those investing in solar panels or grants for developing innovative technologies such as biomass boilers or small-scale hydropower plants. Carbon sequestration protocols in agriculture Carbon sequestration in agriculture helps to capture and store carbon dioxide in soils, vegetation, and other geological formations. In this way, it serves as a tool to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations by trapping or sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. One method of soil sequestration used by farmers is no-till farming practices. These involve leaving crop residues on fields after harvest rather than ploughing them back into the soil. By doing so, more organic matter can break down over time which increases soil fertility and captures additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other strategies may include planting cover crops that help to maintain moisture levels in soils and increase natural nutrient cycling processes. Agricultural land management systems also play an important role in capturing atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis and storage in plant materials such as roots and leaves. For example, incorporating trees onto croplands provides shade which decreases evapotranspiration rates while simultaneously increasing biomass accumulation for long-term soil improvement purposes. Moreover, the use of nitrogen fertilisers should be reduced where possible because they emit nitrous oxide \u2013 a powerful greenhouse gas \u2013 during their application onto fields. Farming resource efficiency standards Resource efficiency involves optimising multiple aspects of farming practices and processes \u2013 such as energy efficiency, sustainable production methods, water conservation, land management and waste reduction. Standards Compliance requirements Benefits Energy efficiency practices Use renewable sources for power generation; reduce consumption of non-renewable resources; implement efficient equipment in production activities. Helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increases cost savings, and improves operational performance. Sustainable farming practices Reduce the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides; pursue organic agriculture techniques when feasible; promote biodiversity by planting native species. Improves soil health and fertility; protects ecosystems from pollution; preserve natural habitats for wildlife. Water conservation standards Minimise water usage throughout operations; install rainwater harvesting systems on farms whenever possible. Enhances water supply availability for future generations; reduces strain on local watersheds and groundwater reserves. Taking these measures can help producers comply with current environmental regulations while also allowing them to benefit from cost savings associated with improved efficiency and reduced waste disposal costs. Additionally, implementing resource efficiency standards has numerous long-term benefits that extend beyond compliance requirements \u2013 including greater sustainability in agricultural production methods, which leads to healthier soils, cleaner air and water, increased biodiversity levels, better crop yields, fewer pests and disease outbreaks, higher quality food products and enhanced animal welfare conditions in livestock husbandry systems. Waste reduction protocols for farmers Farmers must take proactive steps toward implementing sound waste management practices that will significantly reduce waste production and landfill contribution, as well as lower greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly, farmers should assess their current state of operations regarding waste production and disposal methods. This assessment can be used to identify areas where further efforts could result in improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. For example, farmers may need to invest more resources into preventing soil degradation or replacing certain chemicals with safer alternatives. Next, farmers must develop comprehensive plans outlining how they intend to reduce their own wastage while also promoting sustainable practices among other stakeholders such as suppliers and customers. These plans should include measures such as transitioning away from single-use plastics or reducing packaging materials when possible. It would also help if these plans included incentives for others who use the farmer\u2019s products or services so that everyone benefits from adopting greener habits. Finally, it is important for farmers to monitor their progress on an ongoing basis through regular audits and assessments. Doing so will allow them to track how much waste has been effectively reduced over time, allowing them to make adjustments accordingly if needed. Pollution control regulations for farmers Pollution control regulations are essential for farmers to ensure that their operations do not cause excessive air or water pollution. Air and water pollution can have serious consequences both in terms of human health and the environment, so it is important that farms comply with applicable laws and regulations. When it comes to air pollution control, several different regulations apply depending on where the farm is located. For example, some countries may require farms to use certain types of equipment or technologies to reduce emissions from agricultural activities such as animal husbandry or crop production. Similarly, there may be restrictions on burning wood or other materials which could release pollutants into the atmosphere. In some cases, farmers may need to obtain permits before carrying out any activity which has the potential to produce air pollutants. Water pollution control also requires adherence to specific regulations. The type of regulation depends largely on local conditions but typically involves measures designed to prevent contamination of surface waters by fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals used in farming operations; limits on the number of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into rivers and lakes; prevention of erosion caused by overgrazing; and maintenance of riparian zones along waterways. Farmers should take steps to minimise runoff from fields which contain agrichemicals, particularly when these enter sensitive aquatic habitats such as wetlands or coral reefs. Finally, understanding how these various regulations interact with one another is critical. To this end, farm owners should regularly consult with experts who can advise them regarding their particular situation and help them develop strategies for managing their operations sustainably while meeting all legal requirements related to air and water pollution control. Agrotech innovations for farmers Smart irrigation has already proven effective in reducing water usage while still maximising crop yield. By using sensors to determine the exact amount of water needed at any given time, farmers can target their watering efforts more accurately than ever before. This technology also allows farmers to monitor soil moisture levels remotely, helping them reduce labour costs associated with manual monitoring and ensuring they use no more water than necessary. Agrotech solutions such as drones and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionised agricultural production processes by providing accurate data about crops without having to visit each field daily physically. AI-driven analytics platforms allow users to assess conditions such as soil fertility or pest infestations much faster than traditional methods, allowing decisions to be made quickly based on current facts rather than guesswork. Moreover, autonomous farm machines are now capable of performing a variety of tasks like planting seeds or harvesting crops without human intervention \u2013 saving cost, energy and manpower significantly. Finally, agroecology systems provide an invaluable way for farmers to implement sustainable practices into their operations without compromising yields or economic viability. These systems focus on integrating natural resources carefully into production cycles so that crops benefit from natural processes instead of relying solely on chemical inputs. Not only does this reduce reliance on external inputs like fertilisers and pesticides, but it also encourages healthier soils which leads to higher quality produce over longer periods of time \u2013 all achievable through careful management of nature\u2019s own resources. What financial support and incentives are available to farmers? The EU is offering financial support and incentives for farmers, including green deal funding as well as rural development programs and agricultural subsidies. Green Deal funding is designed to provide resources to farmers who are dedicated to making their operations more sustainable and eco-friendly. It covers projects such as organic farming, agroforestry, building energy-efficient structures, developing renewable energy sources, and reducing water pollution. It can also be used for research into new technologies or techniques that increase efficiency in production while ensuring sustainability standards are met. Rural development programs seek to improve economic activity in rural parts of Europe by providing grants and loans to businesses and individuals. These funds can go towards improving infrastructure related to agriculture, forestry management, food processing facilities, marketing campaigns and other activities that promote job creation and economic growth in these areas. Farmers may qualify for special financing opportunities geared towards modernising farm equipment or expanding production with an eye toward sustainability goals set forth by the EU Green Deal. Finally, the EU provides agricultural subsidies which cover a range of expenses associated with running a farm business, such as fertiliser costs, seed purchases, labour wages and veterinary care for animals kept on the property. Subsidies help ensure that small farms remain viable even when market prices drop below what would otherwise allow them to stay profitable. They also give farmers additional security when investing in initiatives mandated by the green deal since they know there will be some form of compensation if their efforts fail to yield desired results over time. Enforcement and monitoring mechanisms for the EU Green Deal environmental commitments To ensure that environmental commitments are met, enforcement and monitoring mechanisms must be implemented as part of the overall policy package. Enforcement measures involve setting up systems for compliance and penalties for non-compliance. This could include establishing reporting requirements and oversight processes or introducing fines for non-adherence. Monitoring mechanisms such as satellite imagery can help track progress towards achieving environmental objectives while also providing data to enforce regulatory regimes. To be able to monitor and enforce compliance with EU green policies effectively, the following key elements should form part of the process: Establishing clear metrics against which performance can be measured; Developing effective communication channels between stakeholders; Introducing incentives for good environmental behaviour; Ensuring adequate resources are available for monitoring efforts. When these elements come together, it creates an environment where farmers can have confidence that their actions will be monitored and enforced accordingly. By having reliable feedback loops in place, farmers can take ownership of their own sustainability journey, knowing how their decisions affect both society and the environment. Moreover, this helps create accountability across all actors involved in making sure sustainable practices become mainstream within Europe\u2019s agricultural sector. What are the implications of the EU Green Deal for farmers in other countries? The international implications of the EU Green Deal are wide-reaching. With its potential to bring about positive environmental change, it\u2019s no wonder that farmers in other countries have begun to take notice. But what exactly does the deal mean for them? What implications arise from adopting the green policies enshrined within it? Firstly, there is a clear benefit regarding sustainability and eco-friendly practices. Farmers who sign up for the EU Green Deal will be expected to adhere to certain environmental standards; these may include reducing their use of pesticides or limiting water consumption on their farms. By taking part in this initiative, they can improve their farm\u2019s efficiency while also helping protect the environment. This could potentially lead to increased profits as well as improved public opinion about agricultural practices worldwide. Secondly, participating in the EU Green Deal could open new markets for farmers outside Europe. As more countries adopt environmentally friendly farming methods and regulations, businesses outside the European Union may be better equipped to meet customer demands abroad. Additionally, those involved in foreign trade may see greater opportunities if they can demonstrate compliance with global standards set by organisations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Thirdly, farmers should consider how they can collaborate with each other and share resources when implementing green initiatives outlined by the EU Green Deal. International cooperation between different nations\u2019 agricultural sectors could help reduce costs associated with adapting production processes and technologies needed to comply with green regulations. It would also provide a platform for exchanging knowledge on sustainable farming techniques, which could ultimately benefit all participants involved. Are there any penalties for farmers not complying with the EU Green Deal? The question of penalties for farmers who do not comply with the EU Green Deal is a crucial one. Firstly, fines may be imposed on those farmers who don\u2019t adhere to the rules laid down by the EU Green Deal. These could range from relatively small amounts to much larger sums which must be paid immediately or over time as part of an extended payment plan. Additionally, some countries may choose to implement other forms of punishment, such as restrictions on trading or potential jail sentences for more serious offences. In addition to financial and legal consequences, farmers can also face reputational damage if found guilty of breaking any rules outlined in the EU Green Deal. This could include negative press coverage or public criticism, making it harder for them to continue doing business successfully in their local communities. Reputation management will become increasingly important going forward, so it pays off for farmers to ensure they\u2019re sticking to all necessary regulations. What are the long-term benefits of complying with the EU Green Deal environmental commitments? Like a phoenix from the ashes, complying with the environmental commitments of the EU Green Deal can bring long-term benefits for farmers. First and foremost, farmers who comply with the EU Green Deal will help sustainably manage their land use and production processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This kind of stewardship over natural resources not only helps ensure healthy ecosystems but also serves as an example for other agricultural operations worldwide. As a result, compliant farms could likely see improved customer relations thanks to increased trust stemming from sustainable practices. In addition, adopting environmentally friendly methods could lead to financial incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies provided by governments or organisations like the European Commission. These rewards could provide more leeway when deciding on investments into new technologies or equipment designed to reduce energy consumption or improve efficiency in resource management. By investing wisely now, farmers may be able to reap greater profits down the road. Finally, compliance with the EU Green Deal brings about social responsibility, demonstrating a commitment to protecting nature and safeguarding food security for future generations. Being part of something larger than oneself gives people purpose and pride \u2013 both important elements necessary for any successful business venture. Embracing these values can give farmers access to a wider pool of customers looking for ethically sourced products while simultaneously boosting public confidence in their efforts towards better environmental protection measures.","filter_flag":1}

The Chinese inverter supplier says the S6 series features added generator connections and control functions, making them particularly suited for markets that experience frequent power outages, such as South Africa. \u201cSolis has launched a new S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter which combines solar generator and battery connectivity to liberate power-starved households and businesses in South Africa from the unpredictability of daily electrical outages,\u201d said James Frank, Solis country manager for South Africa. \u201cIn particular, peak shaving control in both self-use and generator modes allow users to prioritize backup power for their most mission-critical loads more flexibly and cost-effectively.\u201d The inverters are available in five versions, with power outputs of 3 kW, 3.6 kW, 5 kW, 6 kW, and 8 kW. The first four versions measure 440 mm x 598 mm x 205 mm and weight 24 kg. The 8 kW inverter measures 437 mm x 675 mm x 215 mm and weighs 27 kg. The new products have an efficiency rating of 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of 96.2%. They feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with MPPT voltage range between 90 V to 500 V for the 3 kW and 3.6 kW versions, and up to 520 V for the more powerful versions. The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the recommended maximum PV power ranges from 4.8 kW to 12.8 kW. Solis says the inverters support both single-phase and three-phase connections of up to 36 kW in parallel for the smaller devices and of up to 48 kW for the 8 kW inverter. The S6 series is compatible with lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries with battery voltage ranges of 40 V to 60 V. The 8 kW device has a maximum charging and discharging current of 190A, to allow for incorporation of generators with multiple input methods and automatic on\/off control. \u201cThis flexibility avoids over-specifying higher capacity inverters, PV arrays, generators and batteries than necessarily required, with considerable capex and opex savings over our competition,\u201d said Frank. \u201cThanks to an automatic UPS switching function and a 10-second, 200% surge overload capability, users can be confident of a seamless supply during grid interruptions, even for the most sensitive electronic equipment.\u201d The inverters have an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C and are IP66 rated.","filter_flag":1}

The launch includes a new range of Samsung OLED TVs joining its premium Neo QLED 8K & 4K TVs, Q-Series soundbars, and lifestyle display options. The products were developed based on three fundamental principles: 1. Bigger is better when it comes to TVs. Samsung has found that when customers purchase a large-screen TV, they are highly unlikely to regret their decision. They have also found that the number of customers interested in purchasing large TVs is growing rapidly. 2. Large-screen TVs need big picture quality and big audio experiences. 3. Samsung TVs deliver more than their core promises. Through smart home features, Samsung\u2019s goal is to seamlessly deliver more efficiency into the daily lives of their customers. Jeremy Senior, Vice President \u2013 Consumer Electronics, Samsung Australia, said \u201cSamsung understands that technology should empower and enhance every person\u2019s life. That means making big screen experiences more accessible, more intuitive, and more personalised to Australians. In combining our market-leading TV innovations with unique software solutions such as SmartThings, we\u2019re ultimately transforming our TVs from being entertainment units to sitting at the centre of Australian smart home experiences.\u201d Here\u2019s a rundown on what you need to know about the new features: Samsung Smart Home Features Via Smart Hub, the new range of QLED and OLED TVs has SmartThings and the Zigbee & Matter Thread One-Chip Module built in. This means that you can easily integrate all of your home\u2019s smart devices and appliances through the TV, providing more convenience in your day-to-day routine. SmartThings allows you to connect your TV to your air conditioner, dryer, lights, blinds, and more. For example, if you are wearing a Samsung smart watch and your resting heart rate gets to a point that signals that you have fallen asleep, this will switch off the lights and turn the bedroom TV off. Another example is that your TV can alert you if your fridge has been left open accidentally. This not only makes your life easier, but it also increases the energy efficiency of your home. \u201cSamsung is paving the way for smarter homes via support for Matter,\u201d said Jeremy Senior. \u201cThanks to this collaborative mindset and the open nature of the SmartThings platform, Australians can build a network of connected devices that makes their home smarter and their lives easier.\u201d Samsung Neo QLED 8K & 4K The new Samsung Neo QLED 8K and 4K televisions offer stunning picture and design, dynamic audio, and seamless connectivity with other smart devices. They are the perfect choice for bright living spaces due to the Samsung Quantum Mini LED technology which powers over 33 million pixels, providing over a billion shades of colour. Thanks to the advanced Neural Quantum Processor, the TVs automatically upgrade content to 8K or 4K resolution, making details clearer and more vivid than ever before. The 8K and 4K QLED televisions are offered in incredibly immersive screen sizes, ranging from 43 inches to a massive 98 inches. The anti-glare and ultra-wide angle features ensure that the television content can be viewed in vivid colours at any angle or light. Samsung OLED Range In addition to the Neo QLED 8K & 4K televisions, Samsung has launched two new products in the OLED range: the S95C and S90C. These televisions are also powered by a Neural Quantum Processor, and contain 8 million self-illuminating pixels comprising 3 subpixels for an incredible colour display. Motion enhancements have been included in this range to ensure that high-speed games and movies appear consistently crisp. Both models boast blazing-fast speeds up to Motion Rate 200, while Game Motion Plus achieves up to 144Hz 4K VRR. Perks for Gamers The new range of premium QLED and OLED screens also come with added benefits for gamers. This includes the integration of Xbox Game Pass with the TVs, which provides console-free cloud gaming. Additionally, gamers can now fully immerse themselves in their gameplay, as the Neo QLED 4K uses high-performance graphic cards that support 4K resolution at a fast pace. Cinematic Audio If you want to want to get cinema-quality audio in your living room, the new Q-Series and S-Series soundbars are the perfect addition to your setup. Samsung TVs, including the Neo QLED 8K and 4K, Samsung OLED, The Frame, and The Serif pair seamlessly with these new soundbars. SpaceFit Sound takes the personalization of the home cinema experience to another level, by automatically calibrating the TV and soundbar to the specific size and layout of the room. By emitting test tones throughout the space whenever the TV is turned on, SpaceFit Sound optimizes the audio settings for a truly immersive viewing experience.
