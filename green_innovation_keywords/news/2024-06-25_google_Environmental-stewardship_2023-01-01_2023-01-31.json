However, for some shoppers, that\u2019s about to change with new vegan tuna and salmon rolls by Kikka Sushi. Kikka has been a partner of Whole Foods for more than 30 years and offers plant-based sushi options, such as vegetable and salad rolls, at 200 locations of the grocery chain. However, Kikka recently expanded its sushi selection to include its own plant-based fish alternatives, which are now hitting Whole Foods sushi counters at 17 flagship locations in six regions. \u201cWe have always had a strong emphasis on responsible environmental stewardship, and use products that are certified sustainable, natural, and responsible,\u201d Grant Kimura, Director of Marketing and Business Development at Kikka Sushi, tells VegNews. Kikka Sushi \u201cAs food science and plant-based alternatives become more available, we have been able to develop a product in partnership with one of our vendors in Japan to create something that not only looks good but also tastes good,\u201d he says. \u201cPrevious attempts at vegan fish substitutes had one or the other, but this is the first product we have tasted that does both.\u201d Vegan tuna and salmon at Whole Foods To make realistic vegan tuna and salmon, Kikka uses a proprietary blend of red algae and konjac. Often referred to as \u201ckonnyaku,\u201d konjac is a root vegetable that has been popular as a noodle base in Japanese cuisine for centuries. Now, its pliable texture is being explored in other applications, including as a plant-based alternative to fish. Kikka\u2019s plant-based sushi was developed by the company\u2019s vendor in Japan together with Kikka founder Tonny Soesanto, who holds a master\u2019s degree in chemical engineering from acclaimed university California Institute of Technology (CalTech). Kikka Sushi Informed both by Japanese culinary traditions and a deep technical knowledge of plant chemistry and engineering, this unique collaborative effort, Kimura says, is what differentiates Kikka\u2019s plant-based fish from others. \u201cI think the difference is clear when you see and taste the product,\u201d Kimura says. \u201cThe texture and \u2018mouthfeel\u2019 are on point, and the product tastes good.\u201d Plant-based sushi for all Kikka expanded beyond its vegetable-centric sushi options with plant-based tuna and salmon alternatives to attract a broader range of consumers who abstain from fish for myriad reasons. While some avoid eating marine life for ethical reasons, ocean pollution\u2014in the form of plastics and chemicals\u2014has led many to avoid consuming fish, as well. One study published last year found a link between fish consumption and an increased risk of skin cancer, due likely to exposure to mercury. Due to its high levels of mercury, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that people who are pregnant avoid certain fish to reduce chances of birth defects\u2014creating another consumer base fish-free alternatives. Kikka Sushi \u201cOne other demographic we also encounter is expecting mothers who miss fish and sushi, and we are so glad we now have a product that they can consume,\u201d Kimura says. Kikka\u2019s new plant-based sushi is just the beginning for the brand\u2019s exploration of fish-free innovations. Kikka also just launched plant-based gyoza and is working on other vegan seafood items such as hot bowls and poke. Kikka also transitioned to vegan sugar to ensure that all of its white rice products are free from bone char. Vegan seafood makes waves In addition to Kikka, a number of companies have developed realistic alternatives to sushi-grade fish, particularly bluefin tuna as numbers of the apex predator have sharply declined in the last decades due to overfishing. Current Foods is another company in the plant-based space making sushi-grade fish. Made from algae, koji, radish, bamboo, and potato, the company\u2019s vegan tuna is so realistic that it put the startup on TIME\u2019s 100 Best Inventions of 2021 list. GTFO It\u2019s Vegan In 2021, vegan e-commerce platform GTFO It\u2019s Vegan launched its own line of konjac-based vegan tuna, salmon, sailfish, and calamari which can be used for cold preparations of dishes that feature traditional sashimi. Over in Chicago, Aqua Cultured Foods is doing something a little different. The startup uses the power of microbial fermentation to develop vegan whole-cut fish products from mycoprotein. Earlier this month, the startup began the buildout of its new facility which will allow it to scale production of its ultra-realistic calamari, shrimp, scallops, and filets of tuna and whitefish. \u201cThis move is the final step on the road to commercialization of our alt-seafood, and it\u2019s what we and our supporters have been waiting for,\u201d Anne Palermo, CEO of Aqua Cultured Foods CEO, said in a statement. The startup plans to introduce its first products to market in the second quarter of 2023.","filter_flag":1}

It\u2019s a story that\u2019s larger than the performance it provides, the conveniences it offers, and the experiences it creates. It\u2019s a story that affects everyone around you, in ways large and small. And it\u2019s a story that will shape what life is like for generations to come. We\u2019re talking about the story of your hardware\u2019s environmental impact. Was it constructed from responsibly sourced materials? Was it manufactured with sustainable practices? Was it shipped using environmentally friendly packaging? Does it operate efficiently? Will it provide value for a reasonable product lifespan \u2014 and then get reused in a new context down the line? And is it constructed for effective recycling when it reaches the end of its useful lifecycle? At ASUS, we know that we\u2019re directly responsible for many of the chapters in each product\u2019s story. Some chapters are controlled by our industry partners, and we\u2019re responsible for using our influence to elevate their business practices. Other chapters are written by you, our customers. We believe that you, too, share our passion for making a positive impact on the world around us, and we work to empower you to push forward with us toward a more sustainable future. Through our bold ideas and innovative engineering, we\u2019ve already revolutionized our corporate practices and culture to help ensure that we pass on a healthier planet to upcoming generations. But there\u2019s so much more that we can do. For this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) exhibition, we\u2019re showcasing our latest efforts to sustain an incredible future. Through new product designs, new manufacturing techniques, and new partnerships with leading global environmental organizations, we\u2019re creating shared value for everyone. A proven track record Our efforts to make sustainability a core value of our company began many years ago. In 2016 we made our headquarters in Taiwan the first in the consumer IT industry to achieve zero landfill waste. We believe that management is based on visible measurement, so in 2017 we became the first consumer technology company in Asia to produce a Social Return on Investment (SROI) report. In 2019, we became the world\u2019s first technology company to publish an Environemtal Proft and Loss (EP&L) report, and the world\u2019s first company to receive UL Solution\u2019s Environment Circularity Facts Program Validation. This work has created real and positive change for our business, our customers, and our partners. We\u2019ve recycled 40,000+ tons of e-waste just since 2019, and we\u2019ve used 1,500 tons of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics in our products since 2017. Our company provides takeback services to 75% of markets globally, helping to ensure sustainable end-of-life practices for a wide range of our customers. Since 2018, 100% of our key minerals have been sourced from qualified smelters. When it comes to carbon emissions, we\u2019ve backed our public commitments with concrete action. We reduced carbon emissions from our operational electricity consumption by 15.8% between 2021 and 2022. Empowering you to make sustainable choices We know that consumers want to make environmentally friendly choices as they purchase new technology. But we also know that it\u2019s not always easy for consumers to get the information they need to make responsible purchasing decisions. That\u2019s why we work closely with global third-party organizations to certify our products for their environmental impact, and then provide labels for our products that give you the information that you need at a glance. An important certification that you\u2019ll see on many of our products in 2023 comes from the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT). This is the leading global Type-1 ecolabel covering products and services from the technology sector. Any product with an EPEAT verification has been assessed for its material selection, product longevity, packaging, and end-of-life management, among many other factors. An EPEAT Bronze product meets all 25 baseline criteria laid out by the Global Electronics Council, and you can trust that its entire story from materials sourcing to recycling reflects our shared interest in protecting the environment. EPEAT Silver and EPEAT Gold products go above and beyond by meeting additional criteria for environmental stewardship. EPEAT labels empower you to easily measure and compare the environmental impact of different products as you make a purchasing decision. Packaging matters, too. We\u2019ve led the way in using recyclable packaging materials to protect our products on their journey from our manufacturing facilities to your home. Unfortunately, not all providers of forest products share our commitment to sustainable practices. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to partner with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This non-profit organization provides a proven sustainable forest management solution. When a product is FSC Certified, you can trust that its forest-based materials were sourced from responsibly managed forests.** Finally, we\u2019re proud of our many devices that have earned an Energy Star\u00a9 8.0 badge. In order to display this certification, a product must meet the strict energy efficiency criteria laid out for its category by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the U.S. Department of Energy. Energy Star products deliver the same experience you\u2019d expect from standard models, but with less energy. That means you get to enjoy lower electricity bills and help protect the environment without compromising on quality or performance. Leading the way at CES 2023 If you browse the full lineup of new products that we\u2019ve just announced at CES 2023, you\u2019ll find many examples of our relentless quest toward sustainability. Consider our new Zenbook 14X OLED laptop, for instance. This premium notebook gives you exceptional performance with its 13th Gen Intel Core H-series CPU, optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, and a complete set of I\/O ports \u2014 all inside a light, travels-anywhere design. To improve the sustainability of our laptop manufacturing process, we\u2019re debuting a new eco-friendly technology on a key element of this notebook: its finish. For the 2023 Zenbook 14X OLED, we\u2019re introducing a new Plasma Ceramization finishing process that reduces the laptop\u2019s total environmental impact. Through plasma electrolytic oxidation, we create a ceramic-like coating with a premium feel and an 8H* hardness that\u2019s resistant to fading, wear, and fingerprints. This eco-friendly process is halogen free and generates lower toxic emissions than other finishing processes, making the product more durable with less environmental impact. The Zenbook 14X OLED is just one example of how we\u2019re relentlessly optimizing our processes for sustainability. Over 90% of our 2023 consumer laptop lineup is eco-verified. We use as much post-consumer recycled plastics in our laptops as we can without compromising the durability and integrity of the product. Nearly fifty of our 2023 Studiobook, Zenbook, and Vivobook laptops will launch as EPEAT Silver products. Our enterprise customers will also be able to share the value of our sustainability efforts. Our flagship ExpertBook B9450 business laptop leads our lineup in performance and portability, and it\u2019s also an EPEAT Gold product. We designed the ExpertBook B9 OLED (B9403), coming in 2023, with a priority on sustainability. We streamlined its manufacturing process to decrease waste by 29% and production time by up to 75%,* and we eliminated the use of halogen flame retardants in the process. Another option in our commercial laptop series, the ExpertBook B9 (B9400CBA), runs so efficiently that it exceeds the Energy Star standard by a full 67%. Over the lifespan of this device, it\u2019ll provide energy savings equivalent to what you\u2019d need in order to charge 8,267 smartphones. Due to its modular design, 90% of its materials are easy to recycle and reuse in waste treatment plans. All told, our commitment to sustainability throughout this laptop\u2019s full lifecycle from manufacturing to recycling makes it our first carbon-neutral certified commercial laptop. On top of our efforts to offset residual emissions by using nature-based carbon credits, the ExpertBook B9 OLED and ExpertBook B9 move us one step forward on our net zero roadmap. You\u2019ll also see our commitment to sustainability reflected in our notebook packaging in 2023. We make extensive use of recycled paper in our packaging \u2014 as much as 90% of the packaging of certain products is made from recycled pulp. We started using paper materials certified by FSC in our packaging in recent years, and we\u2019re committed to using even more FSC-certified materials in the future, all the while significantly reducing the use of plastic. What\u2019s more, we also design our packaging to be useful even after you\u2019ve unboxed your new laptop. Printed directions make it easy for you to transform a section of the packaging into a convenient laptop stand. At ASUS, we\u2019ve long used our position in the tech industry to lead the way toward a sustainable future, and that extends to our complete portfolio of displays. The ProArt Display PA248CRV, PA279CRV, and PA329CRV, announced at CES 2023, showcase our latest efforts on this important front. Each model is constructed of 85% post-consumer recycled material, and they ship in recycled pulp packaging. We plan for these upcoming models to bear an elite set of sustainability labels in 2023. We\u2019re targeting an Energy Star certification for their efficient operation, we\u2019re targeting the requirements of a TCO Certified label, and we\u2019re working to earn an EPEAT Gold badge for these models to demonstrate that they meet the United States Enivronmental Protection Agency\u2019s highest standards for crucial environmental performance criteria. The new ZenScreen MB249C portable monitor also showcases a wide range of our sustainability efforts. This compact and thin 23.8-inch monitor travels easily to give you the multitasking-boosting power of a second display wherever you need it. Through an exclusive insert molding process, we were able to make it supremely thin and light\u2014it\u2019s a mere 17.7mm thick\u2014cutting down on its materials bill. It also earned an Energy Star ES8.0 badge due to its energy-efficient design. Our efforts to create a sustainable future also extend to our data center products. Across the world, facilities aggressively pursue strategies to reduce their power consumption and increase their reliance on renewable energy sources. It\u2019s not hard to see why: improving efficiency leads to lower operating costs and improved sustainability, both primary motivating factors for today\u2019s decision makers. For our latest AMD EPYC 9004 series servers, we\u2019re helping data centers do even more to make their operations more efficient. With better cooling for storage drives, direct-to-chip liquid cooling solutions, and improved thermal dissipation for CPUs and GPUs with a new independent airflow tunnel design, we\u2019re helping data centers reduce their total energy consumption. Much more to come On our incredible journey toward sustainability, we continually leverage our leadership in data-driven practices and human-centered philosophy. We\u2019ve set ambitious sustainability goals for ourselves that we\u2019re working hard to complete by 2025. Overall, we\u2019ve put ASUS on a path to become a net-zero enterprise focused on creating a circular and responsible future, with shared benefits for every one of us. Four key values drive our innovation and decision making on sustainability. First, we\u2019re committed to real and ongoing climate action. Specifically, we\u2019re working to use 100% renewable energy in our Taiwan-based operation centers by 2030, and in all our global operation centers by 2035. We intend to design each year\u2019s key products with an energy efficiency that\u2019s 30% above the Energy Star Standard. Additionally, we\u2019re working with our key suppliers to achieve a 30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2025. Second, we\u2019re shifting toward a circular economy to extend the lifecycle of our products. This paradigm allows us to target sustainability across every phase of a product\u2019s lifecycle and substantially reduce toxic waste on the planet.

Birds were vaccinated at one day old with live coccidiosis vaccine, at a double dose, they were fed a corn-soy diet with 5% DDGs throughout the study and were raised on used litter. The birds in two Actisaf Sc 47 HR+ groups (representing different feeding rates) \u200bachieved significantly better FCR, compared to birds in both a control group and an antibiotic group, reported Phileo Lesaffre.

At day 39, broilers in the Actisaf Sc 47 HR+ group achieved better production performance across all parameters (body weight, survival rates, feed efficiency, etc.).

These are the first-ever baby food products on the market to include protein from grass fed collagen. The four new varieties include: Berry Butternut, Pumpkin Spice, Sweet Potato Spice, and Beet & Carrot. Serenity Kids' New Dairy-Free Smoothie + Protein Line \"We pride ourselves at continuing to research, innovate, and further impact the baby and toddler food category for the better - and these new Dairy-Free Smoothies as the first baby food products to ever include grass-fed collagen protein prove just that!\" said Serenity Carr, co-founder and CEO of Serenity Kids. Current kid-centric smoothies on the market are made with dairy which is hard for many to digest and fruit that is naturally high in sugar. Other organic dairy-free options still contain over nine grams of sugar and very few vegetables which tend to be very sweet and can encourage an early preference for sugar in children. Serenity Kids' new shelf-stable Dairy-Free Smoothies reimagine the status quo for the category to offer the first low sugar, vegetable-forward option that boasts nutrient-rich protein from grass-fed collagen to support baby and toddlers' overall health, function, and growth. Serenity Kids introduces organic coconut cream in this range as a healthy dairy-free alternative, plus the pouches are packed with nutrition from organic vegetables, herbs, and spices. Each Dairy-Free Smoothie variety is loaded with protein-rich collagen, four grams or less of total sugar from the natural ingredients, no added sugar, five or more grams of brain boosting fat, and five grams of protein. The Berry Butternut Smoothie also includes antioxidant-rich, low glycemic blueberries. Serenity Kids' Smoothies line is third party tested for over 200 heavy metals, plasticizers, and contaminants by the Clean Label Project. \"Collagen continues to trend as a result of its many health benefits, but babies and toddlers have been left out! We have incorporated this superstar ingredient into our new line of shelf-stable, health-forward, and kid-approved Dairy-Free Smoothie + Protein pouches,\" said Carr. \"Young children may not always get enough protein from their normal diet, so collagen can be an effective supplement during this critical time of growth. Collagen can support the health of bones, digestion, connective tissue, and the cardiovascular system. Our new Smoothies line tastes great - the pouches are creamy with a perfect balance of savory and sweet.\" With this new line launch, Serenity Kids also intends to increase the age-range of pouches. While babies typically begin to age out of purees around 18 months, the Dairy-Free Smoothies can be enjoyed well into childhood or even by adults. Other established household brands that have created kid-centric or adult snack pouches have validated the popularity of spouted pouches well beyond baby, and now Serenity Kids' Smoothies are a low-sugar, protein-packed alternative to those products. Serenity Kids uses only premium ingredients without any antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides, fillers, or major allergens. In keeping with the brand's high standards, all of the Dairy-Free Smoothies are non-GMO and USDA Organic certified, contain no added sugar, and are Certified Gluten-Free. The new Dairy-Free Smoothie line will be available online at www.MySerenityKids.com , Thrive Market, and in Whole Foods nationwide for $3.99 MSRP each. The Berry Butternut Dairy-Free Smoothie variety has been selected by Whole Foods Market to be a part of the retailer's Product Discovery Program which highlights new, exciting, and on-trend products within the stores. About Serenity Kids: Serenity Kids makes premium products of the highest nutritional, ethical, and taste standards. Serenity Kids only uses ingredients without any antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides, fillers, GMOs, or major allergens. The brand has established partnerships with Land to Market and Partnership for a Healthier America. All of Serenity Kids' products are Clean Label Project certified, and the brand is one of the few baby and toddler food companies that has received a Clean Label Project Purity Award, indicating the products are amongst the cleanest in the category in terms of heavy metals, pesticides, and other neurotoxins. Serenity Kids' new Dairy-Free Smoothie, Ethically Sourced Meat, Organic Savory Veggie, and Purees with Bone Broth pouch lines as well as the Grain Free Puffs line and new Toddler Formula are available online at www.MySerenityKids.com , Amazon, and Thrive Market, and in over 12,000 grocery stores nationwide including Harris Teeter, select H-E-B locations, Kroger, Natural Grocers, Meijer, select Albertsons\/Safeway locations, Sprouts, Target, Wegmans, Whole Foods Market, Walmart, and more.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}
