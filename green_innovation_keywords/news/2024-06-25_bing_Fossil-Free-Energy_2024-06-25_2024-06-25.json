Drawing insights from real-world cases, the International Community Energy Living Labs (ICELL) research project aspires to develop a systematic screening method that can be applied broadly to design fossil-free energy systems. This project addresses the technical, behavioral, regulatory and legal challenges of developing energy communities. With the community as a key stakeholder, it prioritizes attainable zero-emission strategies and energy justice.","filter_flag":1}
