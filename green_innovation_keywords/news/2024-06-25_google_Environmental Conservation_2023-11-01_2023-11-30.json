Special thanks also to Tefera Belay, INBAR Programme Development Officer, for his contribution and editing. What is the driving mission behind the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan, and how does it relate to mountains? The International Network for Bamboo and Rattan, or \u201cINBAR\u201d, is an intergovernmental organization with 50 member states across Africa, the Americas and Asia that promotes environmentally sustainable development using bamboo and rattan. INBAR\u2019s mission is to improve the well-being of bamboo and rattan stakeholders by promoting the sustainable management of bamboo and rattan resources through strategic and adaptive research and development. In addition to its Secretariat headquartered in China, INBAR has five regional offices in Cameroon, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Ghana and India and holds observer status in the United Nations General Assembly. Bamboo covers over 50 million hectares, primarily in the Global South where most of INBAR\u2019s member states are located. INBAR helps deliver skills, knowledge and technology to vulnerable mountain communities around the world. Projects have spanned from strengthening the bamboo value chain in East Africa's highlands and Asia's mountain regions to facilitating safe, sustainable bamboo construction in the Amazon. Rattan is also critical to INBAR\u2019s sustainable mandate, with many species growing in montane rainforests up to 1 500 metres. Rattan can help improve rural livelihoods through its agroecological and economic potential, as it can grow in degraded soils and can be made into a plethora of high-quality and durable products. What should Mountain Partnership members know about bamboo and rattan? Bamboo, a fast-growing grass plant, and rattan, a spiky climbing palm, can offer versatile nature-based solutions to many pressing global challenges, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, poverty alleviation, job creation, environmental conservation, green trade and resilient construction. In the global highlands, these plants hold special cultural, economic and ecological value. Since bamboo and rattan can be harvested annually without re-planting, they sustain livelihoods, provide income for many mountain communities, and drive economic growth. Bamboo can capture more carbon than some tree species and stores it throughout its lifespan. Both plants are ideal for agroforestry, as they do not compete with other crops, deliver a range of sustainable benefits, and diversify household income streams through value-added activities. Both plants can be used to make baskets, building materials, fabrics and furniture. Bamboo can be made into over 10 000 products such as cutlery, chopsticks, bowls, packaging and other durable products like flooring, furniture, construction materials and more. Since it provides a continuous supply of material, bamboo can also be a renewable source of energy, mitigating deforestation. Rattan is even being explored for innovative uses in the medical sector to help bone repair. These diverse applications have resulted in a booming global bamboo and trade sector worth approximately USD 60 billion. There is enormous potential for mountain communities to harness their traditional skills and knowledge to generate new products and services. What is the role of bamboo and rattan in conserving biodiversity in mountains, and how does it benefit these ecosystems? Bamboo and rattan play a vital role in conserving and restoring mountain ecosystems. Mountains are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced floods, landslides and droughts, disproportionately affecting mountain communities. Bamboo can grow across sloping and degraded lands. Its extensive root and rhizome systems tightly bind soils and regulate streamflow, helping to safeguard watersheds from natural disasters. For example, in India, a bamboo-based landscape project successfully increased the groundwater table by 10 metres in 20 years. Additionally, bamboo\u2019s leaf litter enriches soil organic matter, particularly in harsh mountain environments. Bamboo and rattan are also essential food sources for many endangered wildlife in mountains, including giant and red pandas, mountain gorillas, apes, Indian elephants, South American spectacled bears and bamboo lemurs. Additionally, bamboo provides shelter for various flora and fauna and offers a unique habitat for insects that have adapted to live inside its inner walls. What tangible impact has INBAR had on mountain communities? Since its founding, INBAR has been making a real difference in the lives of millions of people and environments around the world. Many of these actions have been launched in mountain areas. Two of our current flagship mountain projects, the Bambuzon\u00eda project and the Dutch-Sino East Africa Development project, operate in the Amazon and East Africa. Undertaken across Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, the Bambuzon\u00eda project harnesses the potential of bamboo to address land degradation, deforestation and climate change while bolstering livelihoods in rural mountain communities. In 2022, the Bambuzon\u00eda project yielded many positive outcomes across the Latin America and the Caribbean region, with over 3 000 smallholders now implementing bamboo-farming systems and sustainable management practices. Specifically, in the Peruvian Amazon, women of the rural Awaj\u00fan ethnic group have formed their own association \u2014 the Tajimat Women\u2019s Association \u2014 and are now using bamboo to make jewellery. In 2021, the Economic Development Sub-Administration of the Municipality of Awaj\u00fan connected the women of the association with INBAR\u2019s Bambuzon\u00eda project. Project staff were then able to help the community learn more about bamboo and its historical uses in the area. Members of the association champion this model of ecological stewardship coupled with artistic innovation. Bamboo jewellery has created additional economic opportunities for the mountain community through the manufacture and sale of their high-quality jewellery, putting cash into the pockets of Amazonian women. In East Africa, the Dutch-Sino East Africa Development project uses an innovative Triangular Cooperation model to improve the bamboo supply chains in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda to end poverty, create jobs and safeguard nature. The project facilitates the transfer of knowledge, technologies, experiences and vital resources to stakeholders. Our most recent work in 2022 has made significant progress for holistically upgrading the bamboo sector by conducting 42 technical and entrepreneurship trainings, providing skills for 1 270 beneficiaries who are now capable of producing high-quality bamboo products. In addition, 3 300 rural women were provided access to bamboo charcoal briquette-making units, boosting household income and lowering pressure on forests. There has also been a substantial environmental component to the project, supporting 36 large-scale and over 100 small-scale nurseries which have in total grown 365 million new plants. The project also supports the inclusion of 600 hectares of new bamboo plantation and 1 600 hectares of forest and farmland. How does INBAR address climate change challenges in mountains? INBAR comprehensively promotes bamboo as an effective tool to fight climate change in mountain regions, contributing to mitigation and adaptation. INBAR\u2019s interventions, from landscape restoration, agroforestry development and renewable energy production, all contribute to climate change mitigation and help strengthen livelihood resilience in mountain communities. INBAR has also developed over 20 national policies and strategies incorporating measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts. In Southeast Asia, INBAR has worked to refine landscape policy in mountains areas. With donor support from the Government of Germany, the FLOURISH programme aimed at enhancing the potential of forests for climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as livelihood development. The project championed production-driven landscape restoration and community-private sector partnerships in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam. These efforts culminated with a national policy brief in 2022 and visual media showcasing how lung bamboo can bolster resilience for Indigenous Peoples and other forest-adjacent communities. What does INBAR hope to gain by being a member of the Mountain Partnership? INBAR is thrilled to be a part of the Mountain Partnership. As a longstanding ally of mountain peoples and communities, we are excited to have the opportunity to work alongside other great organizations involved in sustainable mountain development. INBAR will benefit by deepened cooperation with organizations with similar thematic focuses through sharing knowledge, identifying new synergies, mobilizing resources and developing and implementing joint projects.

OzFish Unlimited in partnership with Amateur Fishermen\u2019s Association NT will be installing tangle bins across frequented fishing spots around Darwin and Palmerston waterways to aid in keeping the areas free of discarded fishing gear. The project, which is being undertaken by OzFish Unlimited in partnership with the Amateur Fishermen\u2019s Association NT, will see the fishing community to set up permanent bins in eight designated areas where recreational fishers frequently dangle a line. OzFish, as part of its Tackle Loop initiative, will recycle recovered lines and other discarded fishing gear. \u201cWhile the vast majority of fishers take pride in making sure that rubbish associated with their fishing is disposed of appropriately, these bins make it easier than ever, with the bonus of the potential to recycle those items into new products instead of it going to landfill,\u201d OzFish NT project officer Ruby Hatfield said. AFANT said it is looking forward to the project and called for people to help in monitoring, emptying, and ensuring that the tangle bins remain safe. \u201cMost fishers see themselves as stewards of our environment, so we look forward to working with OzFish on this initiative and will be actively promoting opportunities for fishers to get involved,\u201d AFANT CEO David Ciaravolo said. The project is also supported by Boating, Camping, and Fishing (BCF). OzFish is a national environmental conservation charity focusing on maintaining healthy rivers, lakes, and estuaries.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them.

As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}
