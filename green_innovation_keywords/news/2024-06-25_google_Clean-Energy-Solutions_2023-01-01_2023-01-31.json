MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY: Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Tobin, said, \"Dover delivered strong revenue growth and margin improvement in the fourth quarter driven by rigorous execution and improving price-cost dynamics that more than offset the impact of input shortages, inflationary cost pressures and foreign currency translation. Demand trends remained constructive across the portfolio in 2022. Lead times in many businesses have returned to pre-pandemic levels as global supply chains improved. Our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels and provides us good top line visibility into next year. During the fourth quarter, we focused on improving our product delivery metrics and driving solid incremental margins. Additionally, we took numerous measures to improve productivity and efficiency into 2023, principally enabled by advances we achieved in e-commerce adoption, back-office consolidation and SKU complexity reduction. The strong margin performance in the fourth quarter is a testament to the high quality of the team's work, and we expect further benefits from our recent efforts in 2023. We continued to deploy capital toward portfolio improvement, growth and efficiency in 2022. We stepped up capital expenditures towards productivity projects and capacity expansions. We completed several attractive bolt-on acquisitions that provide exposure to high-growth technologies and markets. Finally, we took the opportunity to return capital to shareholders via repurchases principally in the second half of the year. We enter 2023 with a constructive stance. Demand trends in our industrial markets remain healthy and we have a significant volume of business in backlog entering the new year. Expected revenue growth, pricing actions and productivity measures from 2022 lay the foundation for margin accretion in 2023. We have high confidence in Dover's resilient markets, flexible business model and proven execution playbook. Our strategy for superior through-cycle shareholder value creation remains unchanged: to combine solid and consistent growth above GDP, strong operational execution generating meaningful margin accretion over time, and value-added disciplined capital deployment.\" FULL YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE: In 2023, Dover expects to generate GAAP EPS in the range of $7.87 to $8.07 (adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05), based on full year revenue growth of 3% to 5% (all-in and organic).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2022 (unaudited)(amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) Acquisitions During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Witte Pumps & Technology GmbH (\"Witte\") within the Pumps & Process Solutions segment for $81,293, net of cash acquired and subject to customary post-closing adjustments. For the full year 2022, the Company acquired three businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $312.9 million, net of cash acquired and subject to contingent consideration. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Pumps & Process Solutions segment. The purchase price allocation for our acquisitions is preliminary and subject to change during the measurement period. Dispositions The Company had one immaterial disposition the full year of 2022. Restructuring and Other Costs (Benefits) During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, restructuring and other costs (benefits) included restructuring charges of $10.7 million and $30.5 million, respectively, and other costs of $1.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively. For the full year 2022, restructuring expense was comprised primarily of restructuring programs initiated in 2021 and 2022 in response to demand conditions and broad-based operational efficiency initiatives focusing on footprint consolidation. Other costs (benefits) were comprised primarily of non-cash foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation and exit from certain Latin America countries in our Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment.

Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 18.5% and 21.3% for the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 17.3% and 19.8%, respectively. The 2022 tax rate was primarily driven by favorable audit resolutions, including a reduction to income taxes previously recorded related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and the 2021 tax rate was primarily driven by favorable audit resolutions and the tax benefit of share award exercises. Share Repurchases During 2022, the Company received a total of 3,892,295 shares upon completion of an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the \"ASR Agreement\") for $500 million. The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR Agreement was based on the volume-weighted average share price of Dover's common stock during the calculation period of the ASR Agreement, less a discount, which was $128.46 over the term of the ASR Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased, exclusive of the ASR Agreement, approximately 641,428 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $85 million, or $132.52 per share. As of December 31, 2022, 15,283,326 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the November 2020 share repurchase authorization.

Adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted net earnings per share, total segment earnings, total segment earnings margin, adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA margin, free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net earnings, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted net earnings represents net earnings adjusted for the effect of purchase accounting expenses, restructuring and other costs\/benefits, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and gain\/loss on dispositions. Purchase accounting expenses are primarily comprised of amortization of intangible assets and charges related to fair value step-ups for acquired inventory sold during the period. We exclude after-tax purchase accounting expenses because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions the Company consummates. While we have a history of acquisition activity, our acquisitions do not happen in a predictive cycle. Exclusion of purchase accounting expenses facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time. We believe it is important to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. We exclude the other items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to the Company's commercial performance during the period and\/or management believes they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share or adjusted earnings per share represent diluted EPS adjusted for the effect of purchase accounting expenses, restructuring and other costs\/benefits, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and gain\/loss on dispositions. Total segment earnings is defined as the sum of earnings before purchase accounting expenses, restructuring and other costs\/benefits, gain\/loss on dispositions, corporate expenses\/other, interest expense, interest income and provision for income taxes for all segments. Total segment earnings margin is defined as total segment earnings divided by revenue. Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as segment earnings plus other depreciation and amortization expense, which relates to property, plant, and equipment and intangibles, and excludes amounts related to purchase accounting expenses and restructuring and other costs\/benefits. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted segment EBITDA divided by revenue. Management believes the non-GAAP measures above are useful to investors to better understand the Company's ongoing profitability as they will better reflect the Company's core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability to prior and future periods and to its peers. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Net debt to net capitalization ratio is net debt divided by net capitalization. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net earnings equals free cash flow divided by adjusted net earnings. Management believes that free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of liquidity because they provide management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue and bookings performance and trends between periods. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking organic revenue to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure pursuant to the exception provided in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K because we are not able to provide a meaningful or accurate compilation of reconciling items. This is due to the inherent difficulty in accurately forecasting the timing and amounts of the items that would be excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or are out of our control. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of unavailable information which may be material. Performance Measures Definitions Bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. Organic bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. Backlog represents an estimate of the total remaining bookings at a point in time for which performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. This metric is useful as it represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. We use the above operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments.

Swan reached the Geographic South Pole on January 10, 2023, relying solely on KOHLER renewable energy solutions. Swan's trek pays tribute to Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, aviator and the first polar explorer to walk to Antarctica in 1929, who also relied exclusively on KOHLER generators to power his journey. \"Toilet in the Road\" Campaign In the early 1970s, Herb Kohler, long-time company leader and innovator, created a force with THE BOLD LOOK OF KOHLER that transformed the American bathroom from a utilitarian space into one of design, style, sophistication, and craftsmanship. His provocative advertising campaigns challenged conventional norms and targeted consumers directly verses the industry practice of targeting professionals and distributors. One of the most iconic ads from the 1980s came to be known as \"the toilet in the road\" and Kohler plans to reprise that ad in 2023 with breakthrough imagery and video featuring its award-winning Numi smart toilet. Global Market Events Several other 150th anniversary activations and events are planned across the globe over the next year at KOHLER Experience Centers, Kohler Signature Stores, and at various trade shows and events in 2023 including: Kitchen & Bath Industry Show, CONEXPO, Design Shanghai, Milan Design Week, Design Miami\/, Kohler Wellness Retreats, and Kohler Food & Wine to name several.

This heralded moment created a cataclysmic shift within residential design, moving turn-of-the-century America away from the utilitarian white fixtures of the day by introducing color into bathrooms and kitchens \u2013 bringing warmth and personality into every home \u2013 and gracious living into everyday life. KOHLER PRESENTS HERITAGE COLORS Honoring the company's color story that has been almost a century in the making, Heritage Colors are represented through six curated shades hand-selected from the Kohler archives. The six vintage colorways \u2013 Spring Green (1927-1944); Lavender (1927-1944); Peachblow (1934-1973); Sunrise (1953-1969); Avocado (1967-1979); and Pink Champagne (1973-1979) \u2013 comprise Heritage Colors and although the palette is drawn from Kohler's past, the shades remain remarkably au currant. The Heritage Colors voting campaign is underway for consumers to help select two winning shades, which will be represented as part of an exclusive product collection launch later this year. Consumers can cast a vote for their favorite color by visiting www.kohler.com\/forever-in-color.
