The claims mislead consumers and are scientifically inaccurate, according to the BEUC. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019 banana or plastic water bottle,\u201d said Monique Goyens, director general of the BEUC. \u201cCarbon-neutral claims are greenwashing, pure and simple. It\u2019s a smoke screen giving the impression companies are taking serious immediate action on their climate impact. The truth is they are delaying action for many years by \u2018compensating\u2019 their carbon emissions instead. \u201cPlanting trees that will take decades to grow is far easier and cheaper, yet significantly less effective, than cutting emissions from their current climate-harmful activities.\u201d The BEUC takes issue with carbon offsetting, which helps companies in their efforts to reach carbon neutrality. Carbon offsetting allows companies to pay for carbon credits from offsetting projects to balance out the companies\u2019 own carbon-emitting activities. The BEUC includes 11 consumer groups from 10 countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The Climate Neutral Group, Utrecht, includes carbon offsetting as a way to help companies achieve carbon neutrality. A carbon credit represents a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere through a carbon offset, also called a compensation project, according to the Climate Neutral Group. Every credit represents a reduction of one ton of CO 2 in the atmosphere. By investing in carbon offsets, companies take responsibility for emissions they have yet to reduce or avoid, according to the Climate Neutral Group, which added companies should prioritize reducing their own emissions first. \u201cOffsetting is a legitimate working mechanism that helps companies meet their targets,\u201d the Climate Neutral Group said in a white paper. \u201cHowever, compensating for your emissions always needs to happen in conjunction with reduction: It should not be a free pass to just continue emitting.\u201d Carbon-neutral claims have drawn attention in the United States, too. A survey from Morning Consult conducted last July among 2,310 adults found 52% said they had not seen a carbon-neutral label while 41% correctly identified the term after being given three options. A class-action lawsuit against Danone Waters of North America, a business of Danone SA, was filed Oct. 13, 2022, in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit took issue with a carbon-neutral claim on packaging and labeling for Evian, a Danone brand. Reasonable consumers seeing the labeling and packaging would believe the manufacturing of Evian products is sustainable and does not leave a carbon footprint, according to the lawsuit.","filter_flag":1}

According to The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), multiple examples of products claiming carbon neutrality suggest it is. From single-use bottled water, to milk and cheese, meat, and plant-based alternatives, products across various categories now carry the \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019 claim. Even some fruit, from bananas to blueberries and clementines, are known to carry the claim. However, in BEUC\u2019s opinion, there is \u2018no such thing as a carbon neutral banana\u2019. The consumer organisation is calling for a ban on all carbon neutral claims, including \u2018carbon neutral\u2019, \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019, \u2018carbon positive\u2019, and \u2018carbon neutral certified\u2019. Why ban carbon neutral claims?\u200b For a brand to claim carbon neutrality, all emissions it cannot decarbonise are neutralised through the support of environmental projects. This practice is called carbon offsetting. It is also expected that a carbon neutral brand will work to reduce its emissions over time. BEUC takes issue with carbon neutral claims, even when carbon offsetting projects are funded to achieve it. The consumer organisation argues the claim is \u2018scientifically inaccurate\u2019, since the production of all food and drinks will always necessitate the emission of carbon. And the practice of carbon offsetting itself, according to BEUC, provides no guarantees of \u2018locking in\u2019 carbon for the future. Further, the consumer organisation believes such claims mislead consumers, giving the false impression that the products are a good choice for the planet. Carbon neutral claims mislead consumers, argues BEUC. GettyImages\/gilaxia The Carbon Trust, which measures and certifies companies\u2019 carbon neutral claims, agrees that claims such as \u2018carbon positive\u2019 or \u2018climate negative\u2019 should be off the table. Only \u2018carbon neutrality\u2019 has an internationally recognised definition and specification \u2013 PAS 2060, which the Carbon Trust certifies against, explained John Newton, Director, Label Programme Delivery at the Carbon Trust. \u201cOur communications guidelines do not allow the use of terms like \u2018carbon positive\u2019 or \u2018climate negative\u2019 as there is no recognised definition or specification for these terms, and they can easily be misleading,\u201d \u200bhe told this publication. The Carbon Trust does, however, advocate for carbon neutrality. Consumer understanding and labelling transparency can be improved by brands including more context wherever the label is used, Newton advised. There should also be links available, providing consumers access to resources explaining exactly what carbon neutrality is and how it is achieved, he added, which starts with measuring a footprint, then implementing a carbon reduction plan, and finally offsetting the remaining footprint. \u2018Almost all food and drinks will necessitate emissions of carbon\u2019\u200b One of BEUC\u2019s main arguments, is that carbon neutrality is \u2018scientifically inaccurate\u2019, as the production of \u2018all\u2019 food and drinks necessitate the emission of carbon. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019 banana or plastic water bottle. Carbon neutral claims are greenwashing, pure and simple,\u201d \u200bsaid Monique Goyens, director general of BEUC. \u201cIt\u2019s a smoke screen giving the impression companies are taking serious immediate action on their climate impact.\u201d\u200b Research conducted by the German consumer group vzbv found that \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019 and \u2018climate neutral\u2019 claims had the strongest impact on consumer perception of the supposed climate friendliness of a food product \u2013 even more so than providing the product\u2019s detailed CO2 footprint. The same survey found that while a strong majority of consumers (69%) said they felt they understood the \u2018climate neutral\u2019 claim, only 8% of consumers actually understood that the claim did not mean \u2018no greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 had been created. Whether carbon offsetting guarantees the \u2018locking in\u2019 of carbon for the future, or not, is something that should be assessed when selecting offsets, suggests the Carbon Trust. GettyImages\/gan chaonan The Carbon Trust acknowledges that almost all food and drinks will necessitate emissions of carbon. But explained that carbon neutrality simply means that the product has been verified to PAS 2060 and does not attest that there is no net climate impact in the product\u2019s lifecycle. PAS 2060, the internationally accepted methodology for carbon neutrality requires that the manufacturer has a verified footprint for the baseline year of the product; a verified year-on-year reduction in emissions of the product; a commitment to future reductions with a validated carbon reduction plan for the production of the product; and verification that the residual emissions are matched by the purchase of high-quality carbon offsets. \u201cCarbon neutrality is a mature and well-defined term with a well-publicised methodology,\u201d \u200bexplained Carbon Trust\u2019s Newton. \u201cAlthough the name at face value does not adequately explain the full concept, consumers who have an interest in the claim have access to multiple sources of information, and the opportunity to understand the meaning of the term.\u201d\u200b \u2018Locking in\u2019 carbon via offsetting: does it depend on the scheme?\u200b Another reason BEUC takes issue with food and drink brands claiming carbon neutrality, is that carbon offsetting \u2013 which underpins most such claims \u2013 provides no guarantees for \u2018locking in\u2019 carbon for the future. Rather, these companies are \u2018delaying action for many years\u2019 by \u2018compensating\u2019 their carbon emissions, according to Goyens. \u201cPlanting trees which will take decades to grow is far easier and cheaper, yet significantly less effective, than cutting emissions from their current climate-harmful activities.\u201d\u200b Further, the compensatory effects of nature-based offsetting projects are \u2018anything but guaranteed\u2019, stressed the consumer organisation. As in the case of forestry projects, logging \u2013 as well as droughts and wildfires \u2013 can quickly eradicate forests planted as offsetting projects, while the carbon for which they are meant to compensate remains in the atmosphere for centuries. \u201cThe same is true for offsetting schemes that rely on carbon farming programmes, whereby farmers are being paid to implement certain agricultural practices supposed to draw carbon into their soils: once the programme ends, land can be converted to a parking lot or ploughed up, releasing the carbon that has been sequestered.\u201d\u200b Whether carbon offsetting guarantees the \u2018locking in\u2019 of carbon for the future, or not, is something that should be assessed when selecting offsets, suggested the Carbon Trust\u2019s Newton. \u201cThere are differences in the quality of offset schemes and our guidance is that to ensure a carbon offset delivers measurable climate impact, it must meet all five of the following criteria, permanence being one of these.\u201d\u200b Selecting a carbon offset scheme Verified: \u200bto ensure the integrity of the verification process, emissions reductions achieved through a carbon credit should always be verified by an independent third party according to an established standard or protocol. Additional: \u200ba carbon credit is only valuable if the project it funds results in greenhouse gas emissions reductions or removals that would not otherwise have occurred. This condition helps to demonstrate that the project has a measurable impact on the global level of greenhouse gas emissions. Permanent:\u200b the provider must guarantee that the level of carbon emissions avoided, reduced, or removed by the project is maintained over time. For instance, if a carbon credit is used to finance reforestation of an area of land, and that forest then burns down, additional credits must be allocated towards financing an equivalent amount of carbon sequestration. No leakage:\u200b the project funded must not lead to the unintended release of greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. For example, a reforestation project that displaces agricultural activities to other areas where they could generate emissions would not meet this criterion. No double-counting: \u200bthe carbon credit must not be double counted (i.e., sold to more than one buyer, enabling two or more buyers to take ownership of the same carbon reduction). This is often ensured by the provider \u2018retiring\u2019 the credit after sale, making it unavailable for repurchase. This ensures all carbon credits available on the market genuinely represent a unique unit of carbon. Weeding out greenwashing\u200b Ultimately, BEUC believes carbon neutral claims are doing more harm than good. Last year, the European Commission published a proposal aimed at empowering consumers for the green transition, which includes a targeted amendment for the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD). The consumer organisation wants the Commission to ban carbon neutral claims and their derivatives from the annex of the UCPD, and in so doing, effectively \u2018weed out\u2019 carbon neutral claims from the market. The Carbon Trust acknowledges that greenwashing exists, and that is a \u2018significant concern\u2019 in every industry \u2013 with implications for business and consumers. But the \u2018best way\u2019 to avoid greenwashing, according to the Carbon Trust, is via transparent communication. \u201cThe same rules apply no matter what industry a company is operating in; be factual, evidence-based, and make sure claims are not more than achievements. By being honest, truthful, and accurate, consumers will have a clearer, better understanding of the implications of their choices.\u201d\u200b Where there is not enough space on a product\u2019s packaging to provide more information, the consultancy recommends using URL weblinks or QR codes directly to the source of information, and not just to the product\u2019s homepage.","filter_flag":1}

And if the current unsustainable manufacturing practices and consumption patterns continue, the planet will face irreversible ecological consequences, warn scientists. A panel of industrial engineers from Loughborough University\u2019s Centre for Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies (SMART) has warned that the current initiatives, investments and regulations to mitigate the impact of manufacturing on climate change are, at best, slowing down the rate of growth rather than eliminating or reversing the damage caused. Scientists agree that to have any hope of limiting global warming to a maximum increase of 2%, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions need to be reduced by 80% by 2050. Yet the current targets fall far short of this level. The latest estimate is that by 2050, ghg emissions will have increased by over 50%, even with all the current policies and targets in place. \u2018It is the grossest kind of simplification and understatement to say we are not taking enough meaningful action,\u2019 warns Shahin Rahimifard, professor of sustainable engineering at SMART. And the global trainer industry is a huge part of the problem \u2013 if it were a country, it would be the world\u2019s 17th largest polluter, emitting as much CO2 as the whole of the UK. What is sustainability, anyway? Let\u2019s go back to basics and ask if we\u2019re all even speaking the same language when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Specific definitions of what sustainability is and how it can be achieved are difficult to agree on, but the term broadly relates to surviving on earth for a long time by protecting the environment. Professor Rahimifard argues the term is becoming ineffectual, however, because it often refers to the \u2018least worse option\u2019 and the \u2018less bad solution\u2019 but does not go far enough towards solving the earth\u2019s manufacturing and consumption problems. And as companies set their own emission goals, they all interpret environmental language differently. Recognising the vagueness of the term, the London College of Fashion and publisher Conde\u0301 Nast have developed a sustainable-fashion glossary. The term \u2018carbon neutral\u2019, is defined as equivalent to \u2018net zero\u2019 and, in the long term, is achieved by transitioning to an economy that doesn\u2019t rely on burning fossil fuels. This means durable footwear that is manufactured using renewable energy and is made from regenerative organic materials. The materials and products must be transported using packaging and freight that does not rely on fossil fuels. Allbirds Which running shoes are eco-friendly? No major brand has managed to achieve this yet, though is perhaps the closest of the bigger players. Starting with a clean slate (it was set up in 2016), the company has been able to explicitly set its mission statement as \u2018reversing climate change through better business\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s not just about doing less and less of a bad thing; it\u2019s about ultimately using regenerative technologies and ways to actually remove carbon over time through a more modern business model,\u2019 says Jad Finck, Allbirds\u2019 vice president of innovation and sustainability. \u2018One of the biggest challenges of the existing incumbents is the burden of an old dirty portfolio.\u2019 Allbirds does not calculate carbon offsetting in its race to carbon zero, but many companies do and their methods are not always transparent. In reality, many brands are reaching a self-imposed net zero target largely by carbon offsetting. This includes schemes such as planting trees and capturing CO2, which, in itself, requires energy. Carbon offsetting has been heavily criticised for not delivering enough of a reduction in carbon and continuing the status quo, allowing the industry to avoid making radical changes to manufacturing processes. Professor Rahimifard describes a large proportion of carbon offsetting as a \u2018totally shambolic\u2019 approach that doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. \u2018Carbon neutral doesn\u2019t stop creating carbon, which is what\u2019s needed,\u2019 he says. \u2018It\u2019s an estimated type of approach. Net zero, carbon neutral, sustainability \u2013 these terms are becoming part of a dated view that doesn\u2019t address the challenges we\u2019re facing.\u2019 Replacing this language are terms such as climate positive, net-negative emissions and net positive. \u2018The only way is the net positive approach, because sustainability itself is not enough,\u2019 says Professor Rahimifard. \u2018Net positive is a restorative, regenerative, healing approach towards our ecosystem and production industry that puts back more into society and the environment than is taken out.\u2019 What are the current challenges in the footwear industry? The reality of achieving this in the world of running shoes is extremely complex, with convoluted supply chains, dozens of shoe components (65 distinct parts on average) and global distribution of products. The average pair of running shoes generates 14kg of carbon emissions during its life cycle, from raw material to landfill, with manufacturing the largest emitter in the process (9.5kg). Then there is the release of toxic chemicals when shoes are disposed of. \u2018Polyurethane and polyester are responsible for the majority of the carbon footprint,\u2019 explains Danny McLoughlin, author of a report on \u2018eco sneakers\u2019 by running website RunRepeat. \u2018Nylon also has a disproportionate impact. They have a large impact on the carbon footprint because of the amount of energy required to process the materials.\u2019 Critics argue that the footwear industry has been slow to address its role in the climate crisis, using sustainability as a marketing ploy rather than a means to effect meaningful change. But others believe things are beginning to shift in the right direction. \u2018I\u2019m sure there will be examples of brands doing it more as a kind of marketing tool, but I think that is less common today,\u2019 says Naomi Braithwaite, senior lecturer in fashion marketing and branding at Nottingham Trent University. \u2018The way the world is moving, business at all levels is recognising we have to do something differently. So brands really want to make that change, but it\u2019s very hard to be 100% sustainable and I think it takes time,\u2019 says Dr Braithwaite. If we decide to become eco-conscious consumers, it can be difficult to distinguish between greenwashing and genuine net-positive business models when it comes to choosing our running shoes. Allbirds hopes the industry will follow its example by labelling all shoes with a carbon life-cycle emission stamp, which clearly indicates output from cradle to grave. But until this happens, consumers are left to weigh up the pros and cons of the growing array of \u2018sustainable\u2019 footwear products on the market. What can we do to shop more sustainably? One of the simplest ways to reduce your footprint is to buy a shoe that lasts a long time and can be repaired, or recycled when it no longer performs. But recycling via charity shops and clothing banks is hugely problematic. Only 10% to 30% of donated items are actually sold in the charity shops we donate them to, with the rest sold to textile merchants, who ship much of what they buy overseas, often to developing countries. This has led to a surplus in those countries and, ultimately, huge numbers of donations being discarded. Every week, Kantamanto Market in Ghana \u2013 the largest secondhand clothing market in West Africa \u2013 receives 15 million items of used clothing. With 40% of those products being discarded, Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra, is overflowing with clothing waste. This waste is either burned on street corners or on huge bonfires or sent to landfills, where the overflow washes downstream into the ocean, polluting beaches and entire ecosystems as a result. ON RUNNING So which running brands are taking sustainability seriously? Fortunately, some brands are now stepping in to directly recycle their products, grinding down materials to reuse in the manufacture of new shoes. In summer 2022, Merrell launched its , which aims to keep footwear out of landfill. The scheme involves taking back hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes in the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden and Finland. These shoes are repaired and refurbished for resale at 50% of the original price, broken down for use in new products or recycled for other uses. As an incentive, when runners send their no-longer-wanted shoes back, they receive \u00a320 off new Merrell footwear on purchases over \u00a380. Going a step further, Swiss brand . For \u00a325 a month, members can get a fresh pair of shoes every six months, sending their old, used ones back to be ground down and recycled into new components. Related Story On launches a recyclable shoe you can subscribe to Meanwhile, sportsshoes.com has partnered with and delivery firm Evri to enable runners to return old or unwanted shoes, which are then distributed to charities around the world. But critics such as Professor Rahimifard argue that while returning and reusing individual pairs of shoes may provide short-term benefits, these need to be carefully assessed against the carbon involved in shipping and cleaning the footwear. Michael Doughty, co-founder of , says the industry is largely \u2018propagating the same problem, which is a reliance on a finite resource\u2019. \u2018Currently, the sportswear and footwear market is very reliant on fossil fuel-derived materials such as polyester and nylon,\u2019 says Doughty. \u2018A lot of the sustainability work is focused on recycled content of those same materials.\u2019 Related Story 8 best vegan running trainers The issue raised by Professor Rahimifard, Doughty and others is that while recycling may delay products from reaching landfill and have lower carbon emissions than manufacturing shoes from virgin materials, it does not address the underlying issue and is not enough to prevent irreversible changes to the climate. Nor does it do enough to address the huge problem of overconsumption, with schemes such as Cyclon encouraging consumers to get value for money by replacing their footwear every six months. This leads to the hugely damaging belief that shoes have to be replaced after around 500 miles, which drives overconsumption and the carbon emissions needed to satisfy demand. What is the life span of running shoes? Dan Lawson, ultrarunner and co-founder of upcycling outfit ReRun Clothing, says to ignore advice on when to change your trainers. \u2018Shoes can last thousands of miles,\u2019 says Lawson. \u2018It baffles me how shoe companies bang on about shoes\u2019 short lifespans; they should be doing everything to make them last longer.\u2019 Record-breaking ultrarunner Jasmin Paris, a co-founder of The GreenRunners, agrees, estimating that she wears her running shoes for around 2,000 miles. Related Story ReRun clothing: Everything you need to know Addressing the issue of shoes\u2019 lifespan, one of Allbirds\u2019 key commitments is to double the life of its shoes by 2025 through improved construction techniques. It also highlights its machine-washable footwear\u2019s versatility as well as its durability, because, obviously, the more situations a shoe can be worn in, the fewer shoes you need. \u2018We wanted shoes that could blur categories and could be used for running, but that you could also wear for business casual, or to a restaurant,\u2019 explains Finck. \u2018We\u2019re going after modern, timeless classics that stay in our line for a very long time.\u2019 Zen Running Club Newcomers Zen Running Club and Hylo Athletics follow the same mantra, stressing that their plant-powered footwear is built for durability. \u2018We\u2019re very insistent on this shoe lasting as long as any other running shoe on the market,\u2019 says Dominic Sinnott, designer and co-founder of Zen. Meanwhile, Hylo has an NFC (near field communication) tag that, when scanned, links its customers to hyloop, a technology platform that advises on care, repair and recycling options. \u2018We\u2019re trying to encourage longer use of products,\u2019 says Doughty. \u2018The most significant decision you can make is not to buy anything new so we\u2019re trying to encourage that through technology.\u2019 Durability is definitely on the radar of ultrarunning superstar Kilian Jornet, who recently launched NNormaltrail shoes with Spanish footwear brand Camper. Its aim is to produce fewer, more durable products that eschew seasonal changes and fashion trends. The shoes are minimal by design, to reduce the number of seams that degrade over time and use as few components as possible. \u2018I think we need to change the way we sell and buy products,\u2019 says Jornet, \u2018not to try to sell new products to replace old ones that are still in great shape but can \u201cfeel old\u201d. That seems simple, but it involves big changes in the industry. We also need to realise that products are something we should take care of, repair and, eventually, when we need to replace them, ensure a circularity to build new products.\u2019 Which running brands are eco-friendly? Some brands are focusing their attention on recycled materials as a means to reach net zero (but not net positive). Merrell\u2019s Moab Speed trail shoes are made with 100% recycled mesh lining and laces, while Nike\u2019s sustainable materials range feature models such as Pegasus TurboNext Nature, made from 50% recycled content by weight. Using recycled materials is, of course, a positive step, but some argue it doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u2018Those types of materials are really working with the system that we have right now, which is, unfortunately, a large amount of consumer waste is being put into the environment, such as drinks bottles and fishing nets, and these types of things are being turned into those recycled products,\u2019 says Matt Williams, co-founder of Greenspark, which supports businesses\u2019 sustainability goals. But while recycled polyester uses up to 84% less energy to produce than virgin polyester, the material needs to be processed in the first place. Adidas uses waste plastic salvaged from the ocean in the uppers of its Parley shoes, which is undeniably a good thing, but these materials still require energy to be turned into the Primeknit that wraps around your feet. Nike uses polyester made from plastic bottles diverted from landfill, which, again is beneficial, but not without energy costs. A 2021 report by RunRepeat concluded that without updating manufacturing processes, major companies were not going to make meaningful strides in reducing carbon emissions regardless of what material shoes were made from. \u2018Eco-shoes are not going to save the planet \u2013 all they\u2019ll do is kill it a little more slowly than conventional shoes,\u2019 says McLoughlin. His report concluded that \u2018eco-sneakers\u2019 (footwear containing some recycled materials) cut emissions by less than 10% and a shoe with 100% recycled materials makes a saving of just 24%. This was largely due to the manufacturing process making up 64% of all carbon emissions, irrespective of the materials used. You also need to be aware of just how much recycled material is being used, as recycled components may just make up a fraction of a shoe. \u2018There\u2019s definitely been a lot of greenwashing in the market, brands jumping on the green bandwagon,\u2019 says Williams. \u2018That has made it more difficult for consumers to make the right choice. How much is actually recycled? Is it 100% recycled or just 20%, with 80% still being made from virgin materials?\u2019 Is Nike really eco-friendly? Meanwhile, huge brands such as Nike have been promoting their \u2018journey towards a zero carbon and zero waste future\u2019 by announcing partnerships with carbon-offsetting asset management companies such as EFM). But while Nike aims to power owned and operated facilities with 100% renewable energy by as soon as 2025, there is still a reliance on recycled materials. If the footwear industry is serious about having a carbon neutral (without offsetting) or positive impact on the planet, then renewable energy, green transportation and recycled materials are still not enough. Using renewable \u2013 rather than recycled \u2013 materials is the only way to create a completely closed-loop economy. Innovation with plant-based materials, as well as climate-positive wool, are starting to emerge. The question is whether change will occur quickly enough to prevent irreparable damage to the earth. What about Asics? In 2022, Asics launched the Gel-Lyte III CM shoe, with a carbon emission stamp of 1.95kg across its life cycle. This is significantly less than a traditional pair of running shoes, which emit 14kg CO2, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Gel-Lyte III CM contains bio-based polymers in the midsole and sockliner that are partially derived from sugar cane, but a large part of the shoe is derived from recycled polyester. Still, like other initiatives, Williams acknowledges that this is a \u2018step in the right direction\u2019 and Asics sustainability manager Minako Yoshikawa says it \u2018is only the beginning\u2019. Could Allbirds be the most sustainable running brand? Allbirds, which has ambitions to be emissions-free well before 2050, also acknowledges it has a long way to go. But by working with brands such as Adidas on the 2.94kg CO2e [CO2 and other greenhouse gases] Futurecraft shoe, it is trying to lead innovation. Using natural renewable materials such as sugar cane, eucalyptus, plant rubber and merino wool, the company is on target to reduce the use and carbon footprint of raw materials by 25% by the end of 2025. But its goal of \u201875% sustainably sourced materials\u2019 still relies on both natural and recycled components \u2013 for now. \u2018We think natural bio-based is the long-term vision,\u2019 says Finck. \u2018Renewable source, low carbon and, ultimately, regenerative.\u2019 What are the most ethical running shoe brands? Exploring material science is also key to Hylo\u2019s vision of the future of running-shoe production. The company currently uses organic cotton, corn, algae and natural rubber to create a shoe with 60% bio content. \u2018We\u2019re not fully at that north star, but when we look to develop new shoes, we not only think about how can we improve the performance, but also how can we improve that number to 100,\u2019 says Doughty. Similarly, Zen Running Club is innovating with castor beans, eucalyptus, natural rubber and sugar cane while still placing an emphasis on performance. It\u2019s an ongoing process but the company is making consistent progress. \u2018We\u2019re now getting close to 60% sugar cane within the shoe, when a few years ago it was 30%,\u2019 says Sinnott. So how about \u2018super shoes\u2019, which rely heavily on chemicals to create their energy-returning midsoles? Biotechnology is closing in. \u2018There\u2019s a lot of work going into it from our side to try to create a nitrogen-infused bio-based mix,\u2019 says Andy Farnworth, Zen co-founder. \u2018But the super shoe carbon-plated, eco rocker shoes aren\u2019t there yet,\u2019 he admits. While the shift to renewable materials could be a giant stride towards shoe sustainability, Professor Rahimifard points out that organic materials emit methane when they degrade. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, so the end-of-life assessment has to include this. Part of Allbirds\u2019 solution is to use carbon-absorbing wool through regenerative farming techniques in New Zealand, which means the process of producing the wool absorbs more carbon than it emits. Positive change is happening at varying rates across the shoe industry, but when we turn the focus to ourselves as individuals, the biggest thing we can do is simply consume less. Continuing as we are is not a viable option. Professor Rahimifard cites studies that show if everyone in the world consumed at the rate of the average US resident, the resources of five earths would be needed to sustain consumption. The required shift in mindset is not all down to us as individuals. \u2018Perhaps the most important action by all manufacturers, including footwear producers, is to identify how they can create economic growth but not through producing a large volume of products and encouraging increased consumption,\u2019 concludes Professor Rahimifard. But we can play an important part. \u2018Consumers have to change as well,\u2019 says Braithwaite. \u2018It really requires a shift in consumer attitudes and consumer behaviour.\u2019 If you want to take a step towards protecting the planet, looking for more sustainable footwear when you need new shoes can help \u2013 reducing your carbon emissions by around 9% according to RunRepeat.

Every year, the survey examines Finnish consumers\u2019 perceptions of the responsibility of brands. Elovena\u00ae ranked third this year. At Raisio, responsibility is not only part of our strategy, it also reflects the way we do business. \u201cAt Raisio, responsibility and its impact starts with the strategy. It is reflected in everything we do. Successful responsibility work requires effort and cooperation both within Raisio and with partners,\u201d says Sari Koivulehto-M\u00e4kitalo, Raisio\u2019s CLO, legal affairs and corporate responsibility. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that our products are responsible, so that consumers do not need to worry about it themselves.\u201d \u201cWe promote sustainability continuously, as an integral part of our everyday work. The key to systematic work is to have a well-thought-out approach to sustainability; clear policies, practices and objectives; and a constant dialogue within the company. With the changes in the world, responsibility work has become even more important than before. We are delighted that our work has also been noticed by consumers,\u201d says Koivulehto-M\u00e4kitalo. \u201cWe are constantly improving our operations to meet the perceptions and expectations of consumers.\u201d The Sustainable Brand Index measures consumer perceptions. It does not assess the actual responsibility of brands. Recent key responsibility actions we have taken Plant-based products from a new factory: Our plant-based products factory, completed in 2021 in the Raisio industrial area that uses carbon-neutral energy, produces many new products that encourage plant-based eating that is good for the environment and people\u2019s health. The raw material is Finnish, gluten-free oats. Environmentally friendly packaging: All packaging for Elovena\u00ae products is recyclable. Because we do not want to see plastic litter in the environment, especially on the seashore, we are among the first companies to produce drink packaging with caps that stay attached. The EU\u2019s Single-use Plastics (SUP) Directive will require plastic caps to remain attached to the packaging in the future. This requirement for drink packaging will enter into force in July 2024, but we have already taken action on this important goal, ahead of schedule. In 2023, the wrapping of Elovena\u00ae snack biscuits will be replaced by a material suitable for cardboard recycling. The new packaging will reduce the amount of plastic we use. One of our key objectives is to encourage consumers to be responsible and recycle packaging. In addition to recycling labels, our products also include clear, written instructions on how to recycle the packaging. Carbon neutrality: We have worked systematically to make our production facilities carbon-neutral. The Raisionkaari industrial area has long run on carbon-neutral energy, and the Nokia mill has started to produce heating energy from its own oat side streams: whatever does not end up in the products is used in the mill\u2019s own energy plant. Our goal is for the Kauhava factory to also become carbon-neutral by the end of this year. Biodiversity: We are involved in the Hiililounas project, which produces a knowledge base on the carbon footprint of domestic plant proteins and develops nutritionally balanced lunch options with a lower climate impact. In addition to the management of carbon emissions, the protection of biodiversity is important for the well-being of nature and a sustainable future. Scientific and reliable carbon footprint data is seen as a way to increase the use of local plant proteins in catering services and help consumers make responsible food choices. The main funder of the Hiililounas project is the ELY Centre of Southwest Finland, and Raisio is one of the participating companies. Contract farmers: We buy our grain directly from farmers. Our contract options also include an advance payment contract, introduced last year, with the aim of helping farmers at a time when many primary producers are facing a difficult situation due to a number of overlapping crises. Under an advance payment contract, the farmer receives an advance payment for the autumn harvest before sowing has even started. Health: Healthiness without compromising on taste is the basis of Elovena\u00ae products. The nutritional qualities of the products are so good that you can eat them without worrying. This is demonstrated by the Heart Symbol on the products, which indicates that they are healthy alternatives in their respective product categories. A comprehensive overview of our responsibility work can be found in our annual review, entitled Raisio\u2019s Annual Review and Corporate Responsibility Report 2022, to be published on 22 March 2023. The report will be available on our website from 22 March 2023 onwards: www.raisio.com .

We keep creating better plant-based and heart-healthy products so that eating healthily and within the Earth\u2019s ecological capacity can be a pleasure. Our strong brands, such as Benecol\u00ae, H\u00e4rkis\u00ae and Elovena\u00ae, turn our ambitions into reality. Through our responsibility work, we make the hard choices for consumers, so that they can choose Raisio products with confidence. We have around 350 healthy food colleagues in six countries and export to more than 40 markets around the world. Raisio's shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. In 2022, the Group\u2019s comparable net sales for continuing operations were approximately EUR 221 million and the comparable EBIT was approximately EUR 18 million. www.raisio.com","filter_flag":1}

Now, new eco-labels that signify the environmental impact of food are showing up on the front of packages and on restaurant menus. Getty Images It seems that carbon is the new calorie. Panera, Chipotle and Just Salad were the first restaurants to include carbon emissions on menu items. The labels estimate a food\u2019s environmental impact as a carbon equivalent reflecting the greenhouse gas emissions or CO2 spent in the entire journey of a food product, from growing to transportation to cooking or production. This environmental impact is measured in grams or kilograms of carbon. Now there\u2019s an entire movement to put climate change on the menu \u2013 from \u201cclimate positive\u201d entrees to entire restaurants that are certified carbon-free. In the supermarket, foods and beverages are embellished with on-package seals that declare \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d or \u201cclimate neutral.\u201d Do Eco-Labels Matter? I\u2019ll breakdown many of the label claim definitions, but let\u2019s start with the question if these eco-labels can make a difference. Two recent studies suggest they do have the potential to nudge consumers to more climate-responsible food choices. One study conducted by researchers from Harvard and Johns Hopkins found that people may be less likely to choose red meat items from menus that were labeled \u201chigh climate impact.\u201d The beef burger on the menu included the description: \u201cThis item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change.\u201d Researchers at the University of Bristol in the U.K. found similar results in a study that used a traffic light system to rank eco-friendliness of menu items. The green traffic light symbol on a vegetarian burrito helped to significantly increase the likelihood that this more sustainable option was selected. Additionally, 90% of the study participants were supportive of eco-labels. Keep in mind, both of these studies were online experiments exposing people to hypothetical menu items instead of ordering at an actual restaurant. Yet the researchers believe the findings suggest eco-labels have the potential to make a positive impact in real-world settings. Seeking More Sustainable Choices Increasingly people are eager to make changes to their behaviors to benefit the planet. Over three-quarters (78%) agree they want to buy from companies that help them achieve a more sustainable and socially responsible life, according to GreenPrint\u2019s Business of Sustainability Index. They\u2019ll even pay more for sustainable products, yet 78% of those surveyed say that, despite their desire to support companies that align with their values, they don\u2019t know how to identify environmentally friendly companies. Here\u2019s where eco-labels could help. Over two-thirds (68%) use labels to determine if a product is environmentally friendly, with that number jumping to 78% for Generation Z and Millennial consumers. What Different Eco-Labels Mean Some of the so-called green and ethical labels have been around for years, such as USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, Fair Trade Certified, Rainforest Alliance Certified and Certified Humane Raised & Handled. Here\u2019s a look at some of the newer eco-labels used in the food industry and what they mean. Carbon Neutral Certified Carbon neutral or carbon free does not mean a food produces zero emissions. It refers instead to a company compensating for all of the carbon or greenhouse gases emitted during its production and delivery. That\u2019s where third-party organizations come in, such as Carbonfund. that helps companies calculate, reduce and offset their carbon footprint with projects that remove an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere. Carbonfund\u2019s Certified Carbonfree\u00ae products have \"net zero\" CO2 emissions, meaning brands measure and offset the carbon footprint of the products over their full lifecycle. This lifecycle focus is also called \u201ccradle-to-grave,\u201d which means the calculation includes the ingredient sourcing and packaging, product manufacturing, distribution, consumer use and eventual disposal. Carbon Trust is another organization offering carbon neutral certification for products. The group has certified over 27,000 individual product footprints, and many display the label in more than 40 countries. Climate Neutral Certified This label is certified by a nonprofit group called Climate Neutral that\u2019s on a mission to make climate neutrality a priority for companies and individuals. Similar to Carbonfund, they work with companies to measure, reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions with carbon credit investments that help to capture carbon \u2013 projects that include reforestation, mangrove rehabilitation, and landfill management. More than 300 brands have been certified by Climate Neutral, including Zero Carbon Coffee, Numi Organic Tea, and Bud Light Next. Regenerative Organic Certified Regenerative agriculture is often referred to as carbon farming because it restores soil biology, which pulls carbon out of the atmosphere. Regenerative organic agriculture is a collection of practices that focus on regenerating soil health and the entire farm ecosystem \u2013 from the animals to the workers. Developed by the nonprofit Regenerative Organic Alliance, this certification uses the USDA Certified Organic standard as a baseline and adds criteria for soil health, animal welfare and social fairness. The alliance was founded by the Rodale Institute, Dr. Bronner\u2019s and Patagonia. Other members include Compassion in World Farming, Fair World Project and the Textile Exchange. Although \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d has become a popular buzzword, the term is not fully defined and the claim is not regulated. Upcycled Certified Upcycled products are made with ingredients that would have otherwise been thrown out, such as the pulp created when fruits are turned into juice, the spent grain from the beer-making process or the cacao beans that are wasted when making chocolate. This new certification program was developed by the Upcycled Food Association, which has certified more than 200 food products and ingredients \u2013 representing 840 million pounds of food waste. One third of all food produced in the world ends up wasted, which accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Upcycled Certification on-package mark signifies that a specified amount of upcycled ingredients were used. Upcycled certified products include ReGrained bread mixes, Pulp Pantry vegetable chips and Blue Stripes Urban Cacao chocolate bars and cacao water. Certified B Corporations While the Certified B Corporation label does not make any claim about a specific food, it does flag a company\u2019s commitment to meet standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from supply chain practices and input materials to charitable giving and employee benefits. The certification is managed by B Lab, a nonprofit organization \u201ctransforming the global economy to benefit all people, communities and the planet.\u201d The pledge serves as a legal framework for the company's corporate structure, which is intended to help balance profit with purpose. Carbon Confusion Eco-labels have exploded in recent years, totaling 456 globally, according to the Ecolabel Index, a directory of eco-labels across 25 industry categories including food. But not everyone agrees this is a positive trend. Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in the department of environmental studies at New York University, believes the \u201cclimate neutral\u201d or \u201cclimate positive\u201d claims are confusing and misleading. Actually, these foods do not even exist, he says. The trouble is that these claims rely on carbon offsets \u2013 or those projects that are attempting to compensate for a product\u2019s own emissions. While carbon offsets can play a role, it is important to ensure that offset projects are transparent, verifiable and result in real, permanent and additional emissions reductions, he says. Few of these labels give shoppers meaningful guidance in choosing environmentally superior products, he says. You may be tempted to choose an item with a \u201cclimate neutral\u201d label because the item next to it does not make that claim. Yet, he says the non-labeled item could have a 10 times lower carbon footprint. \u201cIf you are feeling confused, there\u2019s probably someone trying to confuse you,\u201d Hayek says. What You Should Do So what should you do? Rather than relying on eco-labels, which may be providing an undeserved green halo, eat more plants and waste less food, Hayek says. Reducing meat and wasting none of it will go a long way in reducing your own personal carbon footprint at home. He also suggests paying attention to the label that really matters \u2013 the nutrition facts panel on the back of the package, which is federally-regulated, transparent and benefits from decades of hard science, all things that the current slate of climate labels lack.","filter_flag":1}

Since its foundation in 2012, Margate-based Haeckels has become the skincare industry\u2019s small-but-mighty disruptor when it comes to carbon-neutral efforts. Now, the team takes its next steps into reducing emissions \u2013 and is doing so by exploring ingredients that have been cultivated in-house, and made from renewable sources. Initially, the collection will include cleansing milk, toner, and serum, with subsequent additions to be launched through a \u201ctest then drop\u201d method. \u201cPut simply, the carbon emissions in growing, processing, shipping, and manufacturing natural ingredients far outweigh their benefits,\u201d the brand says. \u201cMoreover, natural woods and trees are felled to create land to facilitate the growth of these ingredients, while water is refunneled and directed to this land.\u201d The first pieces to be launched were sent out to a select customer base back in November 2022, with the response \u2013 according to the team \u2013 \u201cexceeding predicted metrics\u201d. By testing the products before launching them to market, the brand hopes to be able to work at an even more disruptive and innovative rate \u2013 allowing them to test products without the need for long production runs and bespoke packaging. The new trio has been developed around a proprietary ingredient named Spiraglow. Microbiologically optimized, the ingredient has been shown in clinical trials to reduce fine lines and wrinkles by up to 22 per cent, alongside improving overall elasticity. \u201cLike lab-grown vegan meats, these products are engineered as nature-identical \u2013 they come from renewable ingredients that are far less resource intensive than their natural counterparts,\u201d the brand continues. \u201cThe aim of this new arm of the business is to offer effective solutions in sustainability through lab-grown innovation.\u201d Each of the new Haeckels Labs products is available now. The Spiraglow Hydrating Toner is priced at \u00a342 GBP (approximately $49 USD), the Spiraglow Cleansing Milk at \u00a348 GBP ($57 USD), and the Spiraglow EGF Serum at \u00a372.00 ($87 USD).

With record revenues for the previous year, Porsche now looks ahead toward its goal of delivering 80% electrification throughout its entire vehicle lineup by 2030 and has updated the public on what and when we will see new EV models, including a bespoke SUV prototype. Porsche AG is coming off a big year in 2022. After Porsche chief Oliver Blume took over as CEO of parent company Volkswagen Group last summer, he immediately got to work in boosting the Group\u2019s transition to EVs. The German automaker saw its 100,000th Taycan EV roll off its assembly lines last fall, while Porsche simultaneously began teasing additional EVs to come, including the all-electric Macan SUV. Over the past year, we\u2019ve also learned of an EV version of the 718 on the way, which has been spotted out of roads testing. To build hype head of its planned IPO, Blume and the Porsche team had also begun promising an entirely new SUV codenamed \u201cK1\u201d which will be positioned above both the Macan and Cayenne EVs in the sales pipeline. After completing the largest IPO in Europe by market capitalization last September, Porsche is now reporting encouraging financial figures on its way toward full electrification. Here\u2019s the latest. Credit: Porsche AG Porsche aims for huge sales return on wings of new EVs During its annual press conference earlier today, Porsche\u2019s chairman of the executive board Oliver Blume relayed 13.6% revenue growth in 2022 (37.6 billion euros compared to 33.1 billion in 2021). Operating profit was also up 1.5 billion euros compared to a year prior (+27.4%) alongside record highs in vehicle deliveries and net-cash flow (+0.2 billion euros). Blume elaborated: In difficult conditions, we achieved the strongest result in the history of Porsche, by some distance. We were also able to offer our customers exciting new products yet again in 2022. This is the result of a great team performance. Fresh off its successful public offering, Porsche AG looks to carry momentum into 2023 with lofty new targets. The new year kicked off the group\u2019s new \u201cRoad to 20\u201d program, which aims to achieve an operating return of sales over 20% in the long term. Porsche deputy chairman and member of the executive board for finance and IT Lutz Meschke, spoke to the group\u2019s goals and newfound freedom to achieve them: With the Road to 20 we are making Porsche even more resilient and our brand stronger than ever. And we\u2019re going to take a fresh look at everything, from our product range and pricing to our cost structure. We want to increase the quality of our contribution margins and make our products even more attractive. We can now become even more focused and pick up even more speed. The newly attained autonomy gives us additional entrepreneurial freedom. We will strengthen specific capabilities in key areas such as software and battery technology. According to consulting firm Brand Finance, Porsche sits as the most valuable luxury brand in the world right now, and it looks to transition that reputation over into a complete lineup of new EVs to join the Taycan. According to the Group\u2019s latest production timeline, that will begin with the all-electric Macan in 2024, followed by the aforementioned 718 by mid-decade. Next will come a fourth generation, EV version of Porsche\u2019s larger Cayenne SUV, followed by the entirely new \u201cK1\u201d SUV, positioned at a price point above all its other large EVs. Porsche shared that the new model will offer strong performance and automated driving functions while atop the Group\u2019s SSP sport EV platform. With the new chassis, Porsche is also promising on-road performance and range combined with off-road capabilities in some models. Looking ahead, Porsche is still working to reach a net carbon neutral value chain for its vehicles by 2030, including a net carbon neutral use phase for the BEV models mentioned above. The group also began researching and developing e-fuels at a pilot plant with partners in Chile last year \u2013 a hot topic of debate in the EU as its commission has delayed a final vote to completely ban new sales of combustion vehicles by 2035. Porsche was one of the German automakers requesting guidance on the use of those fuels in the future before the vote is finalized. Meschke states that Porsche expects an operating return on sales between 17-19% in 2023 based on projected sales revenue around 40-42 billion euros.","filter_flag":1}

Too often, such claims are made with \u2018no evidence and justification whatsoever\u2019, according to Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the European Green Deal. This, he explained, opens the door to greenwashing and puts companies making genuinely sustainable products at a disadvantage. \u201cMany Europeans want to contribute to a more sustainable world through their purchases. They need to be able to trust the claims made. With this proposal, we give consumers the reassurance that when something is sold as green, it is actually green.\u201d\u200b Backing up claims with scientific evidence\u200b The proposed criteria would legally bind companies to respect minimum norms on how they substantiate \u2018green claims\u2019 as well as how they communicate them. Before companies communicate \u2018green claims\u2019 \u2013 with the exception of those covered by existing EU rules such as the organic food logo \u2013 they would need to be independently verified and proven with scientific evidence. Companies would be required to identify the environmental impacts that are actually relevant to their product, while also identifying any possible trade-offs, to give a \u2018full and accurate picture\u2019. Promoting requirements imposed by law as a distinctive feature would also be banned. The new proposal was informed by research conducted by the Commission in 2020, which found that more than half (53.3%) of examined environmental claims across the bloc were vague, misleading or unfounded. A total of 40% were unsubstantiated. These findings were confirmed by the Consumer Protection Cooperation authorities in the same year, which revealed that in 57.5% of cases, the trader did not provide sufficient elements allowing for judgement of the claim\u2019s accuracy. Following the ordinary legislative procedure, the Green Claims Directive proposal will now be subject to the approval of the European Parliament and the Council. Half the time, authorities had difficulty identifying whether the claim covered the whole product or only one of its components. It was also unclear whether \u2018green\u2019 claims referred to the company or only certain products. In 75% of the cases, it was unclear which stage of the products lifecycle it covered. In 2020, more than half of examined environmental claims were vague, misleading or unfounded. GettyImages\/Francesco Scatena This is likely having a negative impact on consumer trust in environmental claims, which the Commission described as being \u2018quite low\u2019. During the 2020 open public consultation, the general public did not agree with the statement that they trust environmental statements on products. Making for a level playing field\u200b As it stands, authorities are concerned that companies offering truly sustainable products are disadvantaged compared to those that do not. The Commission hopes the proposed laws, if enforced, will make for a level playing field. For this reason, trade association FoodDrinkEurope, which represents food and beverage manufacturers, is backing the Commission\u2019s objective. \u201cWe firmly support the purpose of the Commission\u2019s proposal which is to avoid misleading information and greenwashing, while ensuring a level playing field among businesses,\u201d \u200ban FDE spokesperson told this publication. \u201cEstablishing harmonised requirements for the voluntary provision of environmental information will further motivate businesses to continue improving their environmental footprint and increase consumer trust.\u201d\u200b Its success, however, hinges on \u2018legal certainty and clarity\u2019, as well as alignment with international standards and the creation of simple and effective tools to enable informed consumer choices, suggested the spokesperson. \u201cAs a Directive, the proposal leaves a lot of room for Member State interpretation, which could create different approaches and divergence for businesses trading across borders.\u200b \u201cIt will be crucial to bring SMEs on board with proportionate rules and effective support systems.\u201d\u200b Has the Commission gone far enough?\u200b Others who have welcomed the proposal suggest the Commission could have gone further in banning \u2018climate-washing\u2019 claims. Changing Markets Foundation, for example, applauded the EU \u2018striking a match\u2019 for the \u2018upcoming bonfire of certification schemes\u2019. \u201cWe have warned such labels to become more robust and transparent for many years, so those who have dragged their heels are in for an unpleasant surprise,\u201d \u200bsaid Changing Markets Foundation campaign manager George Harding-Rolls. But the campaigning organisation is disappointed the Commission stopped short of banning generic climate claims, which it described a \u2018prevalent greenwashing tactic\u2019. \u201cOur research showed that over half of dodgy climate claims in food rely on offsets of dubious quality, misleading consumers into believing they\u2019re buying products with reduced emissions,\u201d \u200bsaid Nusa Urbancic, campaigns director at Changing Markets Foundation. \u201cThe latest IPCC report\u200b showed that we must rapidly reduce emissions from all sectors, so it is a shame that the Green Claims Directive is not turbocharging real climate solutions by banning these false claims.\u201d\u200b The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) also welcomed the Commissions\u2019 \u2018long-awaited\u2019 proposal as an \u2018important step\u2019 towards greener and more sustainable consumption in the EU. In the face of what BEUC describes as a \u2018jungle of unregulated claims\u2019, the Commission is \u2018raising its game\u2019 to fight greenwashing, putting an end to the \u2018wild west\u2019 of unsubstantiated green claims. \u201cPreventing the problem instead of correcting it once the harm is done is an innovative move which will benefit consumers, who want to act sustainably and need reliable information to do so,\u201d \u200bsaid BEUC director general Monique Goyens. But BEUC takes issue with the proposal\u2019s approach to carbon neutral claims, such as \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019. The Commission wants companies to distinguish between their own emission reduction efforts and use of carbon offsetting schemes. BEUC, on the other hand, wants carbon neutral claims banned outright\u200b. Neither Changing Markets Foundation nor BEUC believe the Commission has gone far enough. GettyImages\/filaxia Ultimately, how effective the proposed law will be is dependent on its enforcement, Goyens suggested. \u201cAuthorities will have to heavily fine companies to clean up the market from misleading green claims and labels once and for all. It is also great news that consumer organisations will be able to bring collective complaints to court.\u201d\u200b","filter_flag":1}

The scheme will spawn a broad range of products, including an electric pickup truck alongside a conventional, internal combustion-powered pickup. The trucks were confirmed as part of Mitsubishi\u2019s Mid-Term Business Plan that will commit $10.26 billion to $13.19 billion to electrification through 2030. The money will be spent on R&D and new facilities, including those used for battery production, with more than $1.5 billion earmarked for securing 15 gigawatt-hours of annual battery supply. Mitsubishi expects this investment to cut vehicle CO2 emissions by 40% come 2025, and operational CO2 in half by 2030. By that point, Mitsubishi expects EVs to account for half its global sales, though it doesn\u2019t forecast full electrification until 2035. That means ICE will still play a central role in Mitsubishi\u2019s product plans for the next five years, which will see it launch 16 products globally, nine of them electrified in one way or another. Mitsubishi\u2019s new products for the next five years. Mitsubishi Motors A slide in Mitsubishi\u2019s presentation confirms a wide range of vehicles, from the aforementioned pickups to full-size SUVs and tiny EVs, and everything in between. Mitsubishi Motors CEO Takao Kato said that U.S.-bound EVs will have to be planned with the help of local Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance partner Nissan, which has the domestic manufacturing needed to qualify for the new federal EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Some of the vehicles shown above will broaden Mitsubishi\u2019s lineup of electrified vehicles in the U.S., though the Renault-based Colt hybrid won\u2019t be among them. Mitsubishi\u2019s U.S. product planner confirmed a pickup is of interest, though they emphasized that the global-market Triton isn\u2019t a good candidate due to the Chicken Tax. The prospects for the electric pickup\u2014while still tailored to Mitsubishi\u2019s best markets in Asia and Australia\u2014look better, though whether it\u2019s a long-range model like most American electric trucks or something more affordable doesn\u2019t sound like it has been decided. \u201cI think there will be demand for battery-electric pickups. In the U.S., the Ford Lightning F-150 is quite popular. So, there will be such a trend,\u201d Kato said, according to Automotive News. \u201cThere is demand for environmentally friendly pickups with shorter driving range. So, we would like to consider such possibility as well.\u201d Mitsubishi Ralliart teaser. Mitsubishi Motors Mitsubishi performance cars will also return as soon as next year, which rumors indicate to be an \u201calmighty\u201d Outlander PHEV-based Ralliart SUV. At least one other performance model may be in the works, and Mitsubishi closed its presentation on a slide (above) showing the Ralliart Triton that won its debut rally in 2022. No caption was included to hint at its possible significance, however. Mitsubishi enters 2023 with two years of sales growth and a strong showing in JD Power\u2019s 2023 dependability study, beating Toyota. A company spokesperson admitted at the 2023 Outlander PHEV\u2018s launch that Mitsubishi still isn\u2019t a destination brand, though its investment in desirable products such as pickups and performance vehicles may yet change that.

In 2022, the Europe green steel market was valued at US$47.36 million, and is probable to reach US$1272.06 million by 2028 as Europe's green steel market supply stood at 756.30 thousand tonnes in 2022 The Europe green steel market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 75.24%, during the forecast period of 2023-2028 Green steel is environmentally friendly steel that has a lower carbon footprint than traditional steel-making processes. The implementation of non-coal-based alternative technologies results in a reduction in this footprint. In most cases, green steel production uses green hydrogen rather than coal or electricity generated from non-fossil sources. European green steel market is expected to see growth in the future as European steelmaking rivals, such as Germany's Thyssenkrupp and ArcelorMittal, are also looking at using hydrogen to replace coking coal. With demand growth rising rapidly, it is expected that suppliers of green steel to enjoy a uniquely tight supply\/demand balance over the coming decade with attractive margin upside expected. But as supply grows and green steel becomes the new norm, pricing power is likely to fade in the longer-term. The outlook for green steel demand has positively surprised over recent years with a broader mix of end users than initially expected. It can be observed that demand for green steel has expanded too many more end markets than initially expected. Demand for green steel is ultimately led by a combination of two key drivers: Scope 3 emissions reduction targets and end consumer demand. Europe green steel market demand stood at 1.23 million tonnes in 2022. Europe green steel market has seen a supply in 2021 as SSAB, a Swedish consortium delivered the first batch of the metal - made using 'green' hydrogen - to an automobile manufacturer for truck production. Swedish steel companies will ramp up the country's steel production over the next few years as green hydrogen helps drive the transformation of one of the hardest industries to decarbonize. Europe Green Steel Market Dynamics: Growth Drivers: Green steel is the manufacturing of steel without the use of fossil fuels. Demand for green steel is increasing and technologies continue to be developed as the industry moves towards decarbonization and a more sustainable future. This is considered a positive indicator for the green steel market. Further, the market is expected to increase due to carbon neutrality, certificate-based products, premium green steel, multiple end users, etc. Challenges: Higher cost of production is a major challenge facing the green steel market. One of the main reasons for the higher cost of green steel production is the use of alternative raw materials and energy sources. For example, green steel production often involves using recycled steel scrap as raw material, which is more expensive than using virgin iron ore. The other challenge that green steel market complex carbon accounting calculation, energy crisis, etc. Trends: A major trend gaining pace in green steel market is increasing investment in launching green field projects. Market players are increasingly investing in launching green field projects and building partnerships and strategic alliances to transform their businesses in green steel is driving the market. About two thirds of the projects (31 out of 47) are in Europe, where the largest investments occur. Swedish companies have announced the largest share of investment (with US$22-51 Billion for 6 projects), followed by a South Korean company (US$8.8 Billion) and 11 projects announced by German firms. More trends in the market are believed to augment the growth of green steel market during the forecasted period include high utilization of biomass resources, new technologies, etc. Market Segmentation Analysis: By Type: According to the report, the Europe green steel market is segmented into two types: Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE) segment acquired majority of share in the market in 2022, as it removes the need for coking ovens and blast furnaces. Instead, iron ore is dissolved in a liquid electrolyte solution at a temperature of about 1,600oC before an electrical current is passed through the solution, reducing the iron ore into a liquid in an endothermic reaction. Whereas, Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) segment is expected to have the highest CAGR in the future as arc furnaces used in research laboratories and by dentists may have a capacity of only a few dozen grams. These furnaces run on natural gas and will eventually use green hydrogen (H2), dramatically reducing the plant's carbon emissions. By End User: According to the report, the Europe green steel market is segmented into four end users: Automotive, Construction, Electronics and Other End Users. Automotive segment acquired majority of share in the market in 2022, as green steel is now being used by automakers to ensure a cleaner, greener manufacturing ecosystem. Moreover, international auto makers like GM, Volvo, Mercedes etc., have pledged to become carbon neutral by 2040. By Region: According to this report, the Europe green steel market can be divided into five sub regions: Sweden, Germany, France, UK and Rest of Europe. Sweden green steel market enjoyed the highest market share in 2022, primarily owing to aims for climate neutrality by 2045 and accounts for the biggest investment volume that has been announced. Swedish steel venture H2 Green Steel - founded in 2020 - announced that some of the most prominent European financial institutions have decided to support the hydrogen-based steel plant construction in northern Sweden. These investments and funding would increase the supply as many players would establish green steel plants in Europe. Swedish steel companies will ramp up the country's steel production over the next few years as green hydrogen helps drive the transformation of one of the hardest industries to decarbonize. Competitive Landscape and Recent Developments: As the European market transitions there is a clear first mover advantage with SSAB and Salzgitter ahead of peers and aiming to fully shift to green steel by 2030 and 2033, respectively, vs peers' targets of 2050. Notably, this will allow both companies to gain share in premium green products above and beyond their existing market share in standard grades whilst ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp are set to lose market share due to their relatively slower transitions. SSAB has taken this one step further identifying the transition to green steel as an opportunity to take share in high value automotive markets by also investing in new downstream finishing capacity. The key players are constantly investing in strategic initiatives, such as new product launches, introducing their products to emerging markets and more, to maintain a competitive edge in this market. For instance, in 2022, ArcelorMittal plans to invest US$100 million Also, in 2021, Iberdrola & H2 Green Steel signed a green hydrogen deal of US$2.59 billion. With a capacity to generate 2 million tons of pig iron would be produced & fueled by green hydrogen at the new facility. Europe green steel market is concentrated with SSAB, Salzgitter and ArcelorMittal as best positioned, in Europe.

Established in 1987 as a litho and copy shop in Bath and Chippenham, Digiprint Nettl now offers all kinds of print, and has two advanced design and digital print studios. In January it opened a new signs, display, and exhibition factory to further widen its offering to customers and this led to the purchase of the Latex R1000, which was installed in the same month. Running alongside an HP Latex 800W printer, which was installed a few months earlier in October, the Latex R1000 has changed the way the company operates, particularly the machine\u2019s use of water-based HP Latex inks, which have enabled the business to roll out its new range of products. \u201cOur most important requirement when investing in the printer was the environmentally friendly Latex technology,\u201d said Ben Gregory, director of Digiprint Nettl. \u201cOur business became carbon neutral in 2015 and Climate Positive in 2019, and HP Latex was an essential step to help us achieve this goal. \u201cFor us, choosing to partner with HP was deliberate and researched extensively. As a result of the new HP Latex R1000 investment, we are going to be launching a fully comprehensive range of PVC-free environmentally friendly sign and display products.\u201d He added: \u201cHaving already offered HP Latex to our customers for roll-to-roll printing, adding the flatbed option with an HP R1000 will deliver new markets instantly. \u201cWe have secured contracts with schools, councils, government bodies and larger businesses all due to the increased eco-friendly options available to us now. \u201cWithin a week of installing the HP R1000 we had customers enquiring about new products and services that were previously not achievable. For example, a customer who uses our business for regular print has placed orders for bespoke packaging boxes for large items and has ordered point-of-sale and pallet wrappers to match. \u201cAnother business was ordering transfers for skateboards from China; after some testing on our HP R1000 we profiled a film and have landed an order of over 5,000 skateboard prints.\u201d Digiprint Nettl is a long-term HP customer, having taken on its first HP printer in the 1990s and regularly upgrading its production setup with the manufacturer ever since.","filter_flag":1}

This is the highest profit for the multinational cement manufacturer since its listing in 2003, registering a 14 per cent increase from the previous year's profit of Tk 3.88 billion. \"Launching of new products and acceleration of our waste management services contributed significantly to the record results,\" said Iqbal Chowdhury, CEO of LafargeHolcim Bangladesh. As a result, the cement maker's earnings per share (EPS) stood at Tk 3.83 for 2022 as against Tk 3.34 in the previous year, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Based on the profit, the company declared a record dividend -- 48 per cent cash in total for the year 2022, with a final 15 per cent cash dividend announced on Thursday. Earlier, the cement maker disbursed 15 per cent and 18 per cent interim cash dividend in two phases. The top-tier cement producer's sales revenue also rose 15 per cent year-on-year to Tk 23.59 billion for the year ended December 2022. \"2022 was a commendable year for LafargeHolcim Bangladesh, as we delivered record performance both in profitability and cash generation,\" said Mr Chowdhury. \"We launched new sustainable products, like 'Supercrere Plus', ensured growth in aggregates business, increased our digital footprint and gained traction in our new business channels.\" Mr Chowdhury said LafargeHolcim Bangladesh continued to advance its leadership in sustainability with the 'Geocyle', the waste management initiatives towards the company's goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. \"We are poised for 2023 as we look to continue introducing new innovative and sustainable building material solutions in the Bangladesh market. This will further differentiate us in the market,\" he added. Market experts said LafargeHolcim has a unique edge in business as it sources core raw material -- limestone -- from mines in Meghalaya, India, which is transported to its factory in Chhatak, Sylhet, through a conveyor belt. This edge offers the company to avert freight charges and international raw material market volatility, while the profitability of its competitors mostly depends on these factors. LafargeHolcim also started the aggregates business and production in its Chhatak plant in January 2021. The profitable aggregates business also contributed to the company's revenue growth. The company also launched two new products -- Holcim Water Protect and Holcim Shokti -- in 2021. In the same year, the company's annual net sales increased by 27 per cent to Tk 20.53 billion and net profit jumped 64 per cent to Tk 3.88 billion while the company paid a 25 per cent cash dividend. Listed in 2003, its share price remained stuck at floor level at Tk 64.80 each. Out of the seven cement companies listed in the stock market, three went into the red and three saw their profit slow down at 15-30 per cent while LafargfeHolcim is the only cement manufacturer that posted profit growth in 2022. The industry's decade-low performance in 2022 was rendered by soaring costs, a decline in development work, and a stiff competition among peers amid the acute crisis of the dollar, industry people say.

Founder and CEO of Australian precision fermentation start-up Cauldron, Michele Stansfield. (Source: Cauldron) Founded by Michele Stansfield, the oversubscribed funding round received local and global investment including Main Sequence and Horizon Ventures. It was also one of the largest seed rounds for a female founded start-up. Cauldron said it uses a \u201crevolutionary hyper-fermentation platform that will unlock the production of new forms of food, feed and fibre, and unlock a $700 billion global industry opportunity\u201d. The company claims its unique continuous fermentation process\/hyper-fermentation platform \u201cradically lowers commercial risk, producing ingredients five times more efficiently, with a five times reduction in cost\u201d compared to conventional methods. While fermentation has been used for thousands of years to brew beer and culture cheese, it can take months or years to perfect. Precision fermentation \u201chypercharges\u201d that process, creating the optimal conditions for microorganisms and bacteria to create new proteins, fats, fuels and more, the company said. With Cauldron\u2019s revolutionary fermaculture platform, we are supercharging that process and unlocking the next evolution of how we produce food, feed, and fibre globally. Cauldron CEO and founder Stansfield said, \u201cHumanity has spent thousands of years getting fermentation to work. With Cauldron\u2019s revolutionary fermaculture platform, we are supercharging that process and unlocking the next evolution of how we produce food, feed, and fibre globally. Horizons Ventures\u2019 Chris Liu said, \u201cWe believe Australia has the unique advantages and natural resources to become a world leader in the age of bio-based manufacturing. \u201cCauldron\u2019s hyper-fermentation platform provides a supercharger in the quest for scalable precision fermentation without sacrificing cost and efficiency, particularly due to its easy access to abundant local feedstock supply alongside a carbon neutral production process.\u201d Cauldron founder and CEO, Michele Stansfield. (Source: Cauldron) Stansfield added, \u201cOur technology, 35 years of expertise, combined with Australia\u2019s unique infrastructure and abundance of natural resources, will help ensure companies in this space can get new products and ingredients to market quickly, at lower cost and risk.\u201d Cauldron\u2019s hyper-fermentation platform is a breakthrough for the growing industry, helping precision fermentation companies scale and commercialise new products faster at a much lower risk. The company said it would expand its existing pilot facility in Orange, New South Wales and start building a network of precision fermentation facilities around regional Australia that tap into the country\u2019s agricultural know-how and feedstock while diversifying and creating new local jobs. In January, the Queensland government announced funding for Cauldron to conduct a feasibility study of bringing a world-leading Future Foods BioHub to Mackay in northern Queensland. Stansfield said that the combination of local and global investors with its strong team at the helm meant Cauldron had the resources and experience needed to scale initial production facilities and prove the feasibility of other hubs around Australia. Cauldron co-founder and CFO David Kestenbaum was formerly general partner at ZX Ventures (the CVC arm of AB InBev), where he led all of its investments in biotech and alternative protein. While precision fermentation has been used to create many vitamins and enzymes in food products, and guaranteed a supply of medications like insulin, manufacturing at commercial scale has slowed the industry\u2019s growth dramatically. Issues of commercial scale, time, capital investment, and high production costs have stymied the sector\u2019s capabilities. Cauldron will serve as a regional powerhouse for production to ensure Australia plays a part in the future of agriculture and other industries. Main Sequence partner Phil Morle said, \u201cIf Australia doesn\u2019t tackle this opportunity, others will. Precision fermentation is already a crucial part of medicines like insulin and many animal feeds but is often done at smaller scale and overseas. \u201cCauldron will serve as a regional powerhouse for production to ensure Australia plays a part in the future of agriculture and other industries.\u201d CSIRO predicts it will become a $700 billion industry by 2040, but issues of commercial scale, time, capital investment, and high production costs have been major hurdles. Australian biotech company Loam Bio is using Cauldron\u2019s network to accelerate the production of the microbial technology needed to capture carbon and store it long-term. And ULUU, the Australian company creating a revolutionary natural replacement for plastics, is working with Cauldron to scale up production to help get its first products to market faster and replace plastics across a variety of uses.

Precision Fermentation 101 (Source: Cauldron) Synthetic biology A field of science that involves redesigning organisms for useful purposes by engineering them to have new abilities. Precision fermentation technology A form of synthetic biology that has been around for several decades. The technology uses genetically engineered yeasts and other microorganisms to custom-make a wide range of molecules. How does precision fermentation work? It typically requires the use of genetically engineered microorganisms, which are cultivated in brewery-style fermentation tanks. Think of the microorganism as a little critter that\u2019s been programmed through a range of in-vitro nucleic acid techniques. These little critters \u201ceat\u201d one material, and \u201cexcrete\u201d a different material \u2013 usually edible fats or proteins that are biologically similar to animal products. The most common types of microorganisms used in precision fermentation include yeast, algae, and bacteria. Precision fermentation is designed to develop new ingredients (i.e., proteins, fats, and fibres) which can then be used to create animal-free milk, or plant-based meats, for example. Why is the industry taking off now? While precision fermentation has been around for a while, mostly used in the medical industry (i.e., the development of life-saving medications such as insulin) it\u2019s a relatively new food technology that\u2019s entering the mainstream. Start-ups and established companies alike are looking for ways to harness the technology and bring new products to the market, from pharmaceuticals and food through to new materials such as compostable plastics. These products are often sustainable, climate-friendly alternatives that buck the system and promise a better tomorrow. Products such as milk protein, animal fats, cell-based meat, egg whites and more are receiving hundreds of millions of investor dollars. What\u2019s the difference between fermentation and precision fermentation? Fermentation has been used for thousands of years to brew beer and culture cheese, a process that takes months or years to perfect. Precision fermentation hypercharges that process, creating the optimal conditions for microorganisms and bacteria to create new proteins, fats, fuels and more.","filter_flag":1}
