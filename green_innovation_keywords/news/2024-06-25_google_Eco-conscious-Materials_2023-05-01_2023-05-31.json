If you\u2019re not ready to buy a new mattress, if you want to extend the life of your current mattress, or if you just need a little extra boost of comfort and support, mattress toppers are the key to improved sleep hygiene. Although it can be tempting to purchase a $30 foam mattress topper from your nearest big box store, we highly recommend researching to find the right fit \u2014 for your benefit, as well as the environment\u2019s. It goes without saying: If you already love your bedroom sleep setup, there\u2019s no need to buy something new. But if you\u2019re looking to get more comfortable sleep or prolong the life of your mattress \u2014 without causing harm to the environment \u2014 we\u2019re here to make it easier!

As a certified B Corp, the brand has a large catalog of natural latex mattresses and other bedding accessories that are all certified by trusted parties. Savvy Rest prioritizes values like health impact, the ability to reuse materials, investments in renewable energy, water stewardship, social fairness, and more. Additionally, through a partnership with Carbon Fund, the company offsets its annual estimated carbon emissions. Materials: Savvy Rest uses materials like all natural or organic latex, organic cotton, and wool in its mattress topper offerings. Natural Savvy Woolsy \/ Photo by Johnathan Huang for Good Good Good Mattress Topper Options: Natural Savvy Woolsy \/ Photo by Johnathan Huang for Good Good Good Johnathan\u2019s Thoughts: Savvy Rest sent me the Natural Savvy Woolsy, which is a wool-filled mattress topper with four elastic corner straps to secure it to your mattress. It came minimally wrapped in plastic, in a cardboard box. The outside cotton casing feels very soft, yet thick and durable. I was a little skeptical on how the \u201cquilted\u201d squares would feel, as I thought it might feel like an uneven layer under my back. As someone who prefers their mattress on the firm side, I was also worried that adding a plush mattress topper would make it feel too soft. But \u2014 wow \u2014 I was wrong. After putting a fitted sheet over top and laying down to try it, it felt heavenly. It was like a cloud, but a cloud that still had the firm support of my mattress underneath. It allowed my body to sink in just enough without feeling overwhelming. Even though the material is durable, it doesn\u2019t feel dense or heavy, but light, fluffy, and cool. I have no doubt this will last a long time, though I do wonder if it will get flatter where my body weight is applied each night \u2014 but so far it has remained just as comfortable as the first time I tried it. Savvy Rest\u2019s products are always of such a nice quality, on top of the organic and ethical materials and sourcing. I\u2019m excited to say I am now a mattress topper convert! \u2192 Shop mattress toppers from Savvy Rest \u200d Holy Lamb Organics Two quilted toppers from Holy Lamb Organics \/ Photo courtesy of Holy Lamb Organics What\u2019s good: Holy Lamb Organics creates bed and bath staples, with a mission of \u201cstrengthening the economy based on ecology.\u201d The Fair Trade company has a small and sustainable operation out of Oakville, Washington and practices zero waste initiatives throughout production. None of Holy Lamb\u2019s raw materials ever go into a landfill; instead, the brand upcycles fabric and wool through a ReKindle Program, compost or mulch tiny scraps, and donates extras to schools for creative projects. With a plastic-free packaging policy and Cradle to Cradle practice, Holy Lamb ensures that your bedding can be recycled and repurposed without doing harm to the land, animals, or people. This is thanks to the certified organic materials used in manufacturing; Holy Lamb has a partnership with California mill Woolgatherer to ensure ethical wool practices, as well as certifications and testing clearance from GOTS, OEKO-TEX, Eco Wool, UC Davis Toxicology Lab, and Element Materials Technology. Materials: Holy Lamb utilizes organic cotton fabric, organic latex, premium natural American wool, and certified organic New Zealand wool. All-Natural Quilted Mattress Topper from Holy Lamb Organics \/ Photo by Kamrin Baker for Good Good Good Mattress Topper Options: All-Natural Quilted Mattress Topper from Holy Lamb Organics \/ Photo by Kamrin Baker for Good Good Good Kamrin\u2019s Thoughts: Holy Lamb sent me the All-Natural Quilted Topper, which is made with organic cotton and filled with eco-conscious natural wool. Prior to getting this new topper, I regrettably had a cheap foam mattress topper I got from a department store, and that old one truly pales in comparison to the Holy Lamb mattress topper. The topper came in a large cardboard box with no other additional packaging materials (the giant box came in handy when I moved recently, too!), and it was super easy to transfer onto my queen mattress. Every night when I get into bed, I feel so soothed and supported, and it truly is like landing on a cloud. My sleeping experience has been improved by the soft and gentle bolster (which still feels supportive), and I love that the topper doesn\u2019t have that weird egg carton shape of a mass-manufactured foam option. It feels natural \u2014 like it\u2019s supposed to be there \u2014 and I really feel like it gives me the added cushion I need to get a good night\u2019s rest. That being said, if you\u2019re looking for a firmer option, you\u2019d probably want to check out a latex option with more resistance; in my experience, this one is rather plush. The topper does occasionally shift under my fitted sheet, but it just takes some brief adjusting to get it back to where it needs to be. \u2192 Shop mattress toppers from Holy Lamb Organics \u200d Saatva Natural Latex mattress topper from Saatva \/ Photo courtesy of Saatva \u200dWhat\u2019s good: Saatva is known for its eco-conscious mattresses, but the brand offers more than just a place to rest your head. Saatva sources Fair Trade and certified organic materials, and plants trees with Evertreen, all while adhering to ethical labor standards. Talk about a guilt-free nap! Materials: Saatva\u2019s mattress toppers are made with either perforated natural latex foam, or chemical-free memory foam, and they are all wrapped with certified organic, moisture-wicking cotton. Natural Latex Mattress Topper from Saatva \/ Photo by Jessica Irvin for Good Good Good Mattress Topper Options: Natural Latex Mattress Topper from Saatva \/ Photo by Jessica Irvin for Good Good Good Jessica\u2019s Thoughts: Saatva sent me the Natural Latex Topper and it was a great upgrade to my (already comfortable) Saatva Latex Hybrid mattress. The topper arrived in minimal packaging, wrapped in a single layer of plastic. The elastic bands in the corners are easily slipped under the mattress while still holding the topper securely in place. I haven't had any issues with the topper shifting around like I have with other toppers. It has added extra softness to my mattress, but is still firmer than a lot of topper options on the market. If you\u2019re looking for something more plush, you might opt for a different topper, but this provides a great, firm cushion if you\u2019re looking for some additional support. \u2192 Shop mattress toppers from Saatva \u200d \u200d Other eco-friendly mattress toppers to consider For this section, we\u2019ve conducted research, read dozens of reviews, and included a breakdown of the environmental considerations of each mattress topper \u2014 but we have not yet slept on these ourselves. We will continue to update this article over time. \u200d Avocado Green Mattress Vegan mattress topper from Avocado Green Mattress \/ Photo courtesy of Avocado Green Mattress What\u2019s good: Avocado Green Mattress is a leader in the sustainable sleep space and has a mantra of \u201cnatural, safe, and responsible.\u201d This is carried out through B Corp and Climate Neutral certifications, as well as a vast array of products that are certified by GOTS, GOLS, Made Safe, and Greenguard.

It is worth noting that Avocado's mattress toppers are specifically mentioned in a 2023 class action lawsuit claiming the brand is not as green as it claims. The suit hasn't been settled or closed yet, but it's definitely something to keep in mind as you're making your purchasing decisions.

If you\u2019ve explored our roundup of sustainable mattresses, you already know that the sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution of your bed essentials really do impact your dreamworld \u2014 and the world we all share. Lots of standard mattress toppers are made from foams and materials that are not sustainably sourced, and might even include petroleum-based polyurethane or other toxic chemicals. Here are a few helpful insights on your eco-friendly mattress topper search to help you stay away from those not-so-friendly features: \u200d Materials The mattress toppers we\u2019ve selected only use natural and organic materials. If you\u2019re doing more research on your own, some solid eco-friendly fibers to search for include: Certified organic cotton Certified organic latex Certified ethical wool Bio-engineered foams \u200d Certifications Eco-friendly and organic mattresses are certified by trusted independent organizations that provide rigorous testing and regulations. These third-party environmental and health groups ensure strong standards for sourcing and manufacturing, keeping companies accountable so you can have the best product out there. Non-toxic mattress toppers are often certified or endorsed with the following labels: \u200d Environmental Impact Like with any ethical shopping choices, you should always keep a keen eye on a brand\u2019s environmental impact reports and initiatives. Those who are truly dedicated to sustainability will share transparent information about carbon offsets, packaging, sourcing, and manufacturing, and more. Some may also have partnerships with environmental nonprofits like 1% for the Planet or Climate Neutral. \u200d Social Impact Lastly, another green flag for an ethical brand is the transparent reporting of supply chain and labor practices. Lots of these companies might have B Corp and Fair Trade certifications, so keep those at the front of your mind!","filter_flag":1}

Kindness is at the heart of Bosworth's collection, with some pieces promoting her creative platform, Kind.
