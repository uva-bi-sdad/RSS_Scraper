Generously sponsored by Jindal Shadeed; Sustainable City - Yiti; Nortal; Omantel; and OmanFM, Tejarah Talks is an Oman Business Forum initiative organised in association with the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Investment Promotion (MoCIIP). The next edition of this popular discussion forum \u201cOman\u2019s Journey to Net-Zero: An Environment for Enterprise?\u201d is scheduled for Wednesday 17 May at 7:30pm and will be held at Omantel\u2019s Head Office in Airports Heights. Noting that the session will provide a platform for Omani businesses of all sizes to learn more about the latest developments in sustainable practices and climate-related regulations, Maymuna Al Adawi, MoCIIP Director, Public Private Partnerships and organizer of Tejarah Talks said: \u201cGiven that SMEs make up 90% of all businesses, employ 70% of the world\u2019s workforce and contribute over 50% of global GDP, their role in achieving climate goals is key. Our SMEs here in Oman are no exception. They have a huge role to play in the collective corporate effort to address climate change and achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2050. With this Tejarah Talks, we aim not only to inform but also to inspire and empower local SMEs to take meaningful climate action and seize the opportunities this presents.\u201d Al Adawi went on to explain: \u201cThe green transition will fundamentally transform every part of Oman\u2019s economy. Some of these changes will be visible, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, but most will happen behind the scenes in the way organisations operate and manage their relationships. In fact, Oman\u2019s journey towards Net-Zero presents a raft of opportunities for local SMEs to reduce running costs, develop new products, create jobs, attract investment and new customers \u2013 ultimately helping them maintain a competitive advantage locally and globally. Indeed, we believe sustainable development and economic growth can go hand in hand. We encourage business owners to attend this Tejarah Talks session as we make our way towards a greener future.\u201d Internationally recognized as a country with major potential in the green economy, Oman is already home to several large renewable energy initiatives, including the US$400 million 500MW Ibri greenfield solar power project and the 30GWh Dhofar Wind Power Plant \u2013 the GCC\u2019s first-large-scale wind farm - which are helping reduce reliance on fossil fuels and transition towards cleaner energy sources. Additionally, Oman\u2019s efforts to develop green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technologies demonstrate its firm commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while supporting economic growth. Tejarah Talks \u201cOman\u2019s Journey to Net-Zero: An Environment for Enterprise?\u201d will be moderated by His Highness Sayyid Dr. Adham Al Said, Co-founder, The Firm. Sharing expertise and insights will be panellists Fadi Al Shihabi, KPMG Partner & ESG Services Lead; Dimitra Theodoropulos, Talabat Director, Sustainability; and Hilal Al Ghaithi, Director, Energy, Authority for Public Services Regulation.","filter_flag":1}
