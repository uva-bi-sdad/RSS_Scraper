Since the Indian automotive industry has always been a key indicator of the nation\u2019s economic growth, contributing to approximately 6.5 per cent of India\u2019s overall gross domestic product; 40 per cent of its manufacturing GDP and supporting about 30 million direct and indirect jobs, the growth of this industry should be in sync with the government\u2019s vision of \u2018green growth\u2019. The clear roadmap laid down by the government to ultimately reach the target of net zero by 2070 as outlined in \u2018Panchamrit\u2019, announced by the Prime Minister during COP 26 held in Glasgow in 2021, would be the guiding factor for the industry. \u2018Panchamrit\u2019 also has short-term and mid-term goals for the country. including reduction in carbon intensity. Clean-energy solutions in the transportation sector would play an important role in achieving these goals, as our new vehicles continue to become increasingly carbon benign. In order to align with these government targets, the auto industry adopted BS VI Phase 2 Emission Norms from April 2023, just three years after transiting to BS VI Emission norms in 2020. The industry graduated to the next stage of fuel efficiency norms, for passenger vehicles, from 2022 and is meeting the new fuel efficiency regulations for commercial vehicles from April 2023. These have resulted in the introduction of new products in the market ranging from electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, CNG \/ LNG vehicles and vehicles capable of operating on petrol blended with up to 20 per cent of ethanol. Going forward, the industry would need to continue to build on a strong foundation of sustainability, environmental consciousness and safety. Hence, a range of initiatives have been introduced by the Indian automobile industry under the aegis of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). The six key initiatives being pursued are as follows: The first is biofuels. Through a campaign called \u2018Javik Pahal\u2019, the industry promotes biofuels produced from renewable biological materials. Alternative fuels can play a pivotal role to power vehicles, reducing the reliance on petroleum imports, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and also improving farmer incomes. The second relates to the focus on electrification via the initiative of \u2018Vidyutikaran\u2019 that aims to promote alternatives to fossil fuels by powering vehicles with electric batteries, fuel cells and hybrid or plug-in hybrid technologies. The third pertains to \u2018Chakriyata\u2019, an initiative focusing on recycling and the circular economy. This will minimise waste and ensure that resources are used efficiently and sustainably. The Indian automobile industry will steadfastly support the recycling of end-of-life vehicles and material circularity across different types of power trains to foster environmental sustainability. The fourth initiative is linked to encouraging adoption of gas-based fuels through a campaign of \u2018Gas Gatisheelta\u2019, which retains the focus on CNG and LNG-based mobility, especially for passenger vehicles, three-wheelers, buses and trucks. The fifth is the focus on hydrogen mobility through an initiative called \u2018Harit Hydrogen\u2019 in alignment with the recently announced Green Hydrogen Mission of the government. The sixth and final initiative is associated with road safety through a campaign on \u2018Surakshit Safar\u2019 (Safe Journey). Safety is the prime pillar in this initiative as India accounts for the highest number of road fatalities worldwide at 11 per cent, despite having only 1 per cent of the world\u2019s vehicles. To address this concern, the Indian automobile industry is working with multiple stakeholders to execute the \u20184 Es\u2019 of Road Safety: Education, engineering, enforcement, and emergency care. To support this, Indian OEMs have upgraded their vehicles\u2019 engineering standards in tandem with the UN norms for new and advanced safety features. Moreover, the government is continuously expanding the pan-India network of high-quality roads and highways, which calls for more focus on the entire narrative of \u2018Surakshit Safar\u2019. The auto industry did demonstrate its commitment to the government\u2019s overall \u2018Green Growth\u2019 agenda during Auto Expo \u2013 The Motor Show 2023 in Greater Noida. What clearly stood out at the show was an excellent showcase of vehicles using different types of power-train technologies ranging from gaseous fuels like a CNG \/ LNG, to bio fuels like ethanol or flex fuel vehicles, to electric vehicles including Battery Electric & Hybrid, to even hydrogen vehicles. This demonstrated the direction the Indian automobile industry has taken to move towards sustainable mobility and de-carbonisation. As the Indian economy further strengthens in spite of global geo-political and economic headwinds, there is no doubt the Indian automobile industry will be instrumental in steering the path towards greater green growth and market buoyancy.

A 10-bay EV charging hub has been opened at its Spa Road depot in Melksham, increasing the number of ultra-rapid chargers in the area tenfold, and another in conjuction with M7 Real Estate in Great Yarmouth. As well as being available for public use, the 5 Dual Head ultra-rapid 150kW chargers across 10 EV Charging bays, will service SSE\u2019s local fleet of electric vehicles at Melksham. The high-powered charging units have the potential to allow drivers to resume their journey in just a few minutes . SSE plans to build 500 ultra-rapid EV charging hubs powered by traceable, renewable energy in the UK and Ireland by 2030 with several sites already open or under construction including those in Glasgow and Dundee. Simon Gray, head of fleet for SSE, said: \u201cSSE is putting its money where its mouth is. As part of our Net Zero Acceleration Plan, we\u2019re investing \u00a310 million a day to unleash the low-carbon infrastructure that the UK needs for its net zero transition as part of our commitment to invest \u00a312.5 billion in clean energy solutions by 2026. \u201cThe installation of charging hubs based on our own sites where SSE Fleet vehicles operate will assist us greatly as we transition over 2,500 vehicles to zero emissions by 2030. With the added benefit of opening-up these charging facilities to the public where possible, we can provide even more support to local communities and fleets to help reduce harmful emissions from transport.\u201d The news follows the first of SSE\u2019s ultra-rapid electric vehicle charging hubs being built in conjunction with M7 Real Estate opened by former cabinet minister and local MP, Sir Brandon Lewis CBE. The 10-bay hub at Gapton Hall Retail Park in Great Yarmouth features 150kW charge units which have the potential to allow drivers to resume their journey in just a few minutes , as well as a 22kW charger meaning users have a choice of how to charge when visiting the site. The hub is the first of a potential 50 charging stations installed on sites managed by M7 Real Estate (M7). Kevin Welstead, EV sector director at SSE Energy Solutions said: \u201cGapton Hall is a great example of the sort of hubs that cater to the everyday EV driver, perfectly located to make charging your car straightforward and convenient. \u201cWe\u2019re pressing ahead with our ambitious EV charging infrastructure plans and I look forward to delivering hubs to people right across the UK, both in conjunction with M7 but also with the 500 hubs we plan to build ourselves over the next seven years.\u201d Image courtesy of SSE Energy Solutions Share this: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email ","filter_flag":1}

Big Navajo Energy , which was founded in 2012, is currently expanding its ability to capture and produce hydrogen from sustainable natural resources on native lands which they will then transport to its customers on and off tribal land and rural communities as an alternative clean fuel of our future. \"Big Navajo Energy has spent the past decade bringing clean energy solutions to tribal communities throughout North America and this investment by Brown Venture Group will assist us in continuing to build that self-sufficient ecosystem in order to address energy challenges faced not only by our communities but by rural areas overall,\" said Dory Peters, president and CEO of Big Navajo Energy. Since launching in 2018, Brown Venture Group has forged important inclusive collaborations with tribal governments nationwide, NASA, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (a partnership driven by the Pro Bono Advisory Council). In addition, the venture capital fund has invested in more than 30 technology startups in various industries including clean energy, fintech, health, tech, and software. \"Indigenous nations are one of the most underfunded communities with the most upside potential of any group of contributors in America and Brown Venture Group is excited to support the innovations of Big Navajo Energy,\" said Paul Campbell, co-founder and managing partner of Brown Venture Group. According to a recent Olin Brookings Commission report, in 2021, a mere 0.013% of venture dollars were directed to Native Americans, even though they represent 2.09% of the population (Crunchbase, n.d.). \"While venture capital investment in minority communities remains small, it is practically nonexistent in tribal communities,\" said Campbell. \"This is not because there are not good deals in Indian Country. It is because most non-diverse investors lack the relational networks into Tribal communities, and therefore, miss out on differentiated deal flow that is often found in diverse-led innovative businesses.\" About Brown Venture Group Launched in 2018, Brown Venture Group, LLC, is a venture capital firm exclusively for Black, Latinx, and Indigenous technology startups.
