Effective leadership in HR tech can help businesses to achieve sustained change and eventually a higher degree of effectiveness. In the absence of this effective leadership, businesses lose the required direction to achieve a high degree of competitiveness and market value, and cannot implement a successful change to adapt to today\u2019s digital economy. Strong HR tech leadership is one of the most important issues that organisations are facing today. Today's economy is more digital than ever, and organisations are taking on a new meaning. HR tech helps many organisations solve their issues of cyber security and operational risk management. But does effective HR tech leadership cause the prices of products and services to increase? This may be true at first, but the digital divide is here to stay, and investing in digital products and services will replace analog systems of the past. Therefore, the first shift in the organisation\u2019s leadership to augment HR tech is to move towards reducing costs and increasing profits through effective leadership. Our interviews with 81 HR managers in a wide range of industries from eight countries (Australia, China, South Korea, the United States and four European countries) tell us there is a significant relationship between market value and effective HR tech leadership. Many leadership development sessions are built around new systems and better and more improved ways of conducting business. As organisations develop strong leadership in HR tech, eventually, their market value will grow. Organisations that focus only on profitability without considering the importance of HR tech achieve a lower market value compared to their competitors. Let the data speak Our findings indicate that there are several logical reasons behind the relationship between market value and strong HR tech leadership. Consistent with previous studies, this research has also shown that the first reason is that, when businesses have effective leadership in HR tech, they achieve a level of complexity that will mean the competition is unable to imitate them. This acts as an important strategic flank for organisations to achieve a high level of competitive advantage. Second, effective HR tech leadership acts as a suggested attempt to reduce costs which, if announced, offers a temporary bounce up in the stock price. Companies that effectively lead HR tech with extensive investment have a higher potential to reduce costs compared to other organisations. For example, our research shows that many successful organisations in East Asia, especially in countries such as South Korea and China, develop HR tech leadership as an important weapon in competition with American, Australian and European businesses. They drastically reduce costs and increase the profit and market value of their organisations. Also, Korean and Chinese companies have brought the leadership of HR tech to a level of optimal performance that can minimise the time between the product development life cycle and the management of the relationships with customers and the supply chain of goods and services. This eventually adds to the flow of cash more quickly in their organisations. How to better lead HR tech Our findings suggest that leaders design and implement an integrated information technology system that allows the organisation\u2019s departments and employees to communicate with each other all over the world. At the same time, this integrated and extensive system, which has led to the growth of complexity and competitive advantage of the company, has also reduced the chances of competitors imitating them. In addition, this organisational design provides an important role in the growth of innovation by sharing ideas and communication. A successful example of this integrated IT system can be seen in Alibaba, which, compared to many of its international competitors, such as Amazon, has reached an amazing level of cost reduction and innovative growth. The second suggestion, based on research, is to use new project management techniques and design an organisational culture that is suitable for the HR tech of organisations: \u2018level three leadership\u2019. Jim Clawson coined the phrase, which focuses on vision, purpose, values, stories, music and symbols. The training and development of human resources should also become an inseparable part of the strategic leadership of organisations. Working together in strategic human resource management can bridge the digital divide. In fact, this proposal is to maximise the role of HR tech in the supply chain and communication with customers so that costs can be reduced as much as possible. The next suggestion is to train active leaders in the IT sector with management and business methods so that the maximum possible result can be achieved in this combination of IT with the supply chain and communication with customers. We recommend Clawson\u2019s book, Level Three Leadership for leaders. Leaders are more important than ever today and they must be aware of the importance of HR tech in their companies' market value and the vital role of solutions that can facilitate effective leadership in HR tech. In this article, we have shown that to manage new challenges and achieve a higher level of market value compared to competitors, leaders should start implementing solutions that facilitate the effective leadership of HR tech. This is a secret weapon of market value in today's digital economy.

James Richards examines the scale of the problem. E-cigarettes, or \u2018vapes\u2019, are more popular than ever. Research by public health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) published this year found that 4.3 million people in Great Britain are now vapers. And while vaping has been heralded as a \u2018healthier\u2019 alternative to cigarettes, the habit is causing all sorts of problems for waste managers and the environment. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, most vapes have the same basic functionality: a battery-powered metal coil that heats up the \u2018e-liquid\u2019 (usually containing nicotine) into an aerosol, which is inhaled by the user. They generally fall into two categories \u2013 reusable or disposable. Reusable vapes can be recharged by the user, the battery replaced and the vaping liquid refilled. Disposable vapes are designed to be used and discarded. A headache for waste managers For Ray Parmenter, head of policy and technical at CIWM, the complex nature of the products is causing a major headache for the sector. \u2018Vapes come in many forms, and their sheer diversity makes it very difficult to deal with as a waste stream,\u2019 he says. \u2018Each unit is typically composed of plastics, metals, a lithium battery, and some have LED lights, sensors and even microprocessors. The fact they lock up so many valuable resources into a hard-to-recycle unit makes them an anathema to waste managers.\u2019 Some vapes can be dismantled, allowing the user to dispose of the different elements into the correct waste streams. In general, any electrical component would have to be consigned to e-waste recycling. Some vapes can be dismantled, allowing the user to dispose of the different elements into the correct waste streams. In general, any electrical component would have to be consigned to e-waste recycling. However, the vape \u2018chamber\u2019 is often a mixture of glass and plastic, which presents even diligent users with a dilemma. And, unless all the pieces are cleaned, there is a risk of introducing liquid nicotine into the environment. However, according to consultant and CIWM trustee Duncan Simpson, even if the vape unit is disposed of correctly as e-waste, the problems don\u2019t end there. \u2018Due to the complex combination of materials \u2013 and the possibility of left-over nicotine in the unit \u2013 they have to be dismantled by hand in order to dispose of the elements appropriately, which is labour intensive and expensive,\u2019 he said. Resources up in smoke The bottom line is that consumers find it hard to recycle vapes. This has resulted in huge quantities of e-cigarettes being binned every year. Indeed, recent research by Material Focus has found that, of the almost half a billion vapes (reusable and disposable) bought annually in the UK, a third are thrown away, which amounts to three million per week. The cost in resource terms is staggering: Material Focus estimates that the volume of all vapes sent to landfill or incineration each year contains around 23 tonnes of lithium, the equivalent to 2,884 electric vehicle batteries. \u2018Beyond the enormous squandering of resources, vapes disposed of in residual waste streams pose a fire risk,\u2019 says Simpson. \u2018If units that contain batteries end up inside bins or recycling vehicles, and are crushed, they may be punctured and self-combust, igniting the dry waste around them.\u2019 Single-use vapes The problem is particularly acute around disposable vapes. Typically, these cheap, single-use units last for around 1-5 days (although some promise longer lifespans). Many of these come pre-charged and are ready to use right out of the box. This level of convenience means they are extremely popular: Material Focus suggests that 14 million single-use vapes are bought each week. For Parmenter, disposable vapes are the perfect example of how not to design a product. \u2018Who thought this was a good idea? It\u2019s a classic example of designers paying no heed whatsoever to the end of life of the product,\u2019 he said. The issue is compounded by the fact that, according to research by industry body the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), up to 60 per cent of disposable vapes being sold in the UK are actually illicit \u2013 either non-compliant with domestic laws or counterfeit. Speaking to conveniencestore.co.uk in August, UKVIA director general John Dunne admitted this was a \u2018huge concern\u2019, and revealed his organisation \u2018receives between 200 and 400 reports of illegal sellers in the UK every month\u2019. The littering issue Unfortunately, many of these unregulated units are being sold illegally to young people. Research by ASH has found that almost half of 18-24-year-olds are using disposable vapes. Although some disposable vapes are capable of being dismantled and recycled, the all-in-one design seems to be driving increased instances of littering. \u2018Anecdotally, it\u2019s easy to see that disposable vapes are creating a littering problem,\u2019 says Parmenter. \u2018One finds them scattered around outside schools, discarded by children who presumably don\u2019t have the inclination or awareness to at least put them in the bin. And a glance at the average pavement or car park will confirm this is becoming a more widespread problem.\u2019 Legislation and control One potential solution would be to operate a type of deposit-return system, says Simpson, reimbursing people financially if they return the vapes to the place where they bought them. Simpson points out that vapes are covered by existing waste regulations. Indeed, these units are classed as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) under UK law, meaning that producers or importers of WEEE products have a responsibility under the regulations to make sure they are recycled, and to place themselves on a register. Sellers of electrical items \u2013 such as vapes \u2013 are also obliged under the regulations to offer a take-back service for customers on the purchase of equivalent items. Either that, or they join the Distributor Takeback Scheme (DTS), under which they will pay a fee that supports the local authority\u2019s recycling efforts, and provide information to customers about recycling points. However, in the absence of a collection scheme for vapes, those retailers offering a take-back service would be faced with the same disposal dilemma as individuals. One potential solution would be to operate a type of deposit-return system, reimbursing people financially if they return the vapes to the place where they bought them. One recent investigation by Sky News found that neither the manufacturer or importer of two of the leading vape brands were listed on the WEEE register. Simpson suggests that the existing regulations would ideally be tweaked to take account of these relatively new products. He also acknowledges the need to \u2018drive illicit players\u2019 from the shelves, but notes a desire among legitimate producers to create a properly regulated market. \u2018Some consumers and producers want to do the right thing\u2019, he says. \u2018To enable this, we need to corral the right people together \u2013 the regulators, producers and waste professionals \u2013 and come up with a clear system with which to present to consumers.\u2019 For Parmenter, the existing battery take-back scheme could be a template for an e-cigarette recycling service. \u2018The model is certainly there,\u2019 he says. \u2018And once we have sufficient volume, there\u2019s a greater likelihood that waste companies will innovate and create a process \u2013 most likely using robotics \u2013 that can safely and efficiently dismantle and recycle vapes on an industrial scale.\u2019","filter_flag":1}

The Aluminium Recycling Coalition aims to drive a \u201cstep-change\u201d in recycling the metal in the UAE and to promote aluminium recycling by consumers, particularly beverage cans, EGA said in a statement. The coalition includes EGA, Abu Dhabi Waste Management Company (Tadweer), Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company, Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company, BeeahTandeef, Pepsi-bottler Dubai Refreshment, Canpack, Crown Bevcan, Dulsco Group and France-based resource management group Veolia. \u201cAluminium demand is expected to grow worldwide by between 50 per cent and 80 per cent by 2050, because of the key role of this infinitely recyclable material in achieving net zero,\u201d said Mariam Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment. \u201cCo-operation throughout the value chain, such as the Aluminium Recycling Coalition, will speed the decarbonisation of our economy in line with the Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative.\u201d A March 2022 study by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI), a body representing the global primary aluminium industry, showed that more than 70 per cent of the material used in aluminium cans is recycled into new products \u2014 almost double that of glass (34 per cent) and plastic (40 per cent). It also found that aluminium cans best support a circular economy, and that compared with aluminium cans, more glass and plastic bottles end up in landfills because they are not collected. The UAE's Aluminium Recycling Coalition will \"enhance the UAE\u2019s position as a global leader in international efforts towards green development, support our 2031 goals on the circular economy and contribute to building a knowledge-based economy that is more resilient and competitive\", Abdullah bin Touq, UAE Minister of Economy, said. Recycling plastic bottles to earn free Abu Dhabi bus rides - in pictures Workers collect plastic bottles for recycling. Nilanjana Gupta \/ The National Last year, EGA announced plans to build an aluminium recycling plant with a capacity of 150,000 tonnes per year as it looks to decarbonise its operations. EGA was also the first Middle East-based company to join the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, a global body that sets sustainability standards for the industry. \u201cRecyclability is one reason aluminium is so important for human progress, but every day as a society we throw too much of this valuable metal away,\" Abdulnasser bin Kalban, chief executive of EGA, said. \"By championing the Aluminium Recycling Coalition, EGA aims to increase aluminium recycling rates in the UAE to the benefit of our society and economy.\" The UAE is aiming to achieve net zero by 2050 with new investments worth Dh600 billion ($163.5 billion) planned in clean and renewable energy sources over the next three decades. EGA, one of the world's largest aluminium producers, has smelters in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The company is developing its own technology to decarbonise operations and reduce emissions. Its aluminium is shipped to more than 50 countries. EGA generates about Dh20 billion in economic activity yearly and supports more than 60,000 jobs in the UAE. The aluminium sector accounts for 1.4 per cent of the UAE economy.","filter_flag":1}
