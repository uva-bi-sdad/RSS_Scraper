Pros of ESG Cons of ESG This piecemeal approach may not be sufficient to address the magnitude and urgency of global challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and corporate accountability. Conclusion The views expressed above belong to the author(s). ORF research and analyses now available on Telegram! Click here to access our curated content \u2014 blogs, longforms and interviews. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) has emerged as a powerful formalised force in shaping the business landscape, not only in terms of governance but also in driving the business of business itself. ESG considerations are increasingly recognised as critical factors that can impact a company's financial performance, risk management, and long-term sustainability. While governance has been the traditional focus of ESG, there is a growing recognition that ESG can also create value and drive innovation, providing companies with a competitive advantage in today's dynamic business environment. ESG, as a set of criteria used by investors to evaluate a company's sustainability and ethical practices, has gained traction as a tool for aligning investments with values such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and good governance. Many companies have jumped on the ESG bandwagon, touting their efforts to reduce carbon emissions, improve labour practices, and enhance board diversity. ESG has been lauded as a way to hold companies accountable for their impact on the planet and society and as a means to drive positive change. ESG is heralded as the \u201cnext page\u201d in responsible investing, promising a brighter future for our planet and society. However, upon closer examination, one might wonder if ESG is merely a \u201cbackspace\u201d, undoing the negative impact of unsustainable practices, rather than propelling us forward towards truly sustainable solutions. One key concern is that ESG metrics are often voluntary and self-reported, allowing companies to cherry-pick and report only the positive aspects of their practices while neglecting to mention and address the negative ones. This lack of standardised reporting and transparency makes it challenging for investors to accurately assess a company's true sustainability performance. One of the challenges is the short-term focus of financial markets, which often prioritise immediate financial gains over long-term sustainability. This can create misaligned incentives for companies to prioritise short-term financial performance at the expense of ESG considerations. Additionally, the lack of consistent and standardised ESG data and reporting can make it difficult for investors and stakeholders to accurately assess a company's ESG performance and compare it with peers.Another criticism of ESG is that it often focuses on incremental changes within existing systems, rather than challenging the status quo or advocating for systemic change. For instance, a company may invest in renewable energy to reduce its carbon footprint but still engage in environmentally damaging activities in other areas of its operations. This piecemeal approach may not be sufficient to address the magnitude and urgency of global challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and corporate accountability. ESG also faces limitations in addressing the underlying structural issues that contribute to environmental and social problems. For instance, ESG may not fully capture the systemic risks associated with supply chain practices, product lifecycle, or corporate lobbying. Additionally, ESG may not adequately account for the perspectives and priorities of local communities, indigenous peoples, or marginalised groups, whose voices are often excluded from decision-making processes.One of the ways ESG can help the business of business is through driving innovation. For example, companies that prioritise environmental sustainability are investing in research and development of clean technologies, renewable energy solutions, and circular economy practices. These efforts can lead to the development of new products, services, and business models that address pressing environmental challenges, while also capturing emerging market opportunities. For instance, companies like Patagonia and Interface have successfully integrated sustainability into their product offerings, leading to increased customer loyalty and market share. Moreover, social considerations within ESG, such as diversity, inclusion, and fair labour practices, can also drive innovation. Companies that foster a diverse and inclusive workforce are shown to be more innovative and better able to understand and serve diverse customer segments. Additionally, companies that prioritise fair labour practices throughout their supply chains can reduce reputational risks and ensure sustainable supply chain operations. For example, companies like Unilever and Danone have integrated social considerations into their business strategies, leading to improved brand reputation and customer loyalty. Companies that proactively manage social risks, such as labour violations, human rights abuses, and community impact, can avoid costly lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage. For example, companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Coca-Cola have faced legal and reputational challenges related to water management practices, leading to increased scrutiny and financial risks. Many global investors have started to adopt ESG strategies as a means of deploying growth capital and achieving sustainable growth. For example, private equity firm BlackRock has made sustainability a core focus and has set ambitious goals to align its investment portfolio with ESG principles , including divesting from companies with high carbon emissions and engaging with companies on climate-related risks.However, there have also been failures in the ESG space. One prominent challenge is the lack of standardised ESG metrics and reporting frameworks, which has led to inconsistent and sometimes misleading ESG disclosures by companies. This has resulted in \u201c greenwashing ,\u201d where companies claim to be environmentally or socially responsible without substantiating their claims. For instance, the Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2015 revealed that the company had manipulated emissions data to meet regulatory requirements, despite promoting itself as an environmentally responsible brand Another failure is the \u201c ESG paradox ,\u201d where companies that score well on ESG metrics may not necessarily align with the broader sustainability goals of society. For example, a company that has a good ESG score due to its gender diversity initiatives may still contribute to environmental degradation or engage in unethical business practices. This highlights the need for a holistic approach to ESG that considers all three pillars\u2014environmental, social, and governance\u2014and their interconnectedness, rather than a narrow focus on individual metrics. Another limitation is the potential for ESG to be misused as a marketing tool without meaningful action. Some companies may engage in greenwashing or engage in surface-level ESG initiatives solely for public relations purposes, without making substantial changes to their business practices. This highlights the need for robust and transparent ESG reporting, verification, and accountability mechanisms to ensure that companies are genuinely committed to sustainable practices. But then, there are concerns about the lack of accountability and enforcement mechanisms for ESG practices, due to lack of or weak legal requirements and regulatory oversight to ensure companies comply with ESG principles. This can lead to inconsistency and variability in ESG performance and reporting, making it difficult for investors and stakeholders to assess a company's true sustainability performance.ESG is reshaping the governance of businesses and the business of business by promoting sustainability, social responsibility, and stakeholder engagement. There have been successes in the integration of ESG principles, including the adoption of sustainability practices by leading corporations and the rise of impact investing. However, there have also been failures, such as inconsistent reporting, greenwashing, and the ESG paradox. Moving forward, it is crucial to develop standardised ESG metrics, enhance accountability mechanisms, and adopt a holistic approach that considers the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and governance factors. ESG is one change in management that we would want to adopt as part of business culture, however, loud the criticisms are, and early some of the failures are.","filter_flag":1}

Fish and other aquatic products from aquaculture can and will play a major role in meeting the dietary demands of all people, while also meeting the food security needs of the poorest. Recognizing the critical importance of aquaculture, and the need to exchange and discuss reliable information to further enhance its contribution to sustainable development, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), at the request of its Members, collaborated with the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to organize the Global Conference on Aquaculture Millennium +20 (GCA +20), on September 22\u201325, 2021 in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China. Under the theme \u201cAquaculture for food and sustainable development\u201d, the hybrid conference brought together experts and stakeholders from the aquaculture sector to discuss the current state and future of aquaculture, as well as its role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The GCA +20 was the fourth in a series of development-oriented conferences with the ambition of shaping the future of global aquaculture. The FAO Technical Conference on Aquaculture (Kyoto, Japan, 1976) reviewed the status, problems, opportunities, and potential for the culture of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and seaweeds, and declared that the aquaculture sector had made encouraging progress in the past decades, producing significant quantities of nutritious food, income, and employment. The NACA\/FAO GCA Millennium Conference (Bangkok, Thailand, 2000) adopted the Bangkok Declaration and Strategy on Aquaculture Development Beyond 2000, which articulated strategic elements addressing the role of aquaculture in alleviating poverty, enhancing food security, and maintaining the integrity and sustainability of natural resources and the environment (NACA\/FAO, 2001). Importantly, the strong recommendations for enhanced international collaboration on global and regional aquaculture, which emerged from the conference, were brought to the attention of FAO's Committee on Fisheries (COFI) leading to the establishment of a new COFI Sub-Committee on Aquaculture in 2001, the only intergovernmental forum specifically dedicated to aquaculture (Halwart, 2022). The FAO\/NACA GCA +10 (Phuket, Thailand, 2010) adopted the Phuket Consensus: a re-affirmation of commitment to the Bangkok Declaration, which recognized the continued value and relevance of the Strategy (FAO\/NACA, 2012; Annex S1). The GCA +20 in turn highlighted the crucial role of aquaculture in providing a sustainable source of aquatic food, rich in protein and micronutrients, for a growing global population. With harvesting of wild fish stocks at capacity or declining because of overfishing and climate and environmental changes, aquaculture has become an essential source of aquatic food, providing over half of the world's fish for human consumption. However, the conference also recognized that the growth of the industry has come with environmental and social challenges, such as habitat destruction, pollution, inequality, social injustice, and labor rights issues. Regional and thematic reviews represent core elements of the GCA +20. Nine technical themes were selected for GCA +20, by an International Programme Committee, for their current and future relevance in the transformation of aquaculture toward achieving the SDGs. The themes cover core technical subjects, the social and human dimensions of aquaculture, and the planning and governance of the sector. Nine thematic reviews based on the themes were prepared by a group of technical experts commissioned by FAO. The thematic reviews covered the key issues of the day regarding the development and future progress of the development of sustainable aquaculture. Each review detailed the current and future trends, challenges, and opportunities, and considered crosscutting issues including biodiversity, gender mainstreaming, climate change, and capacity building. Following expert review, GCA +20 participants were invited to provide feedback on the reviews and their key messages, for a period before, during, and after the conference. At the conference, key findings from each thematic review were presented and then discussed by expert panels with input from the GCA +20 delegates. This written and oral feedback was provided for consideration by the authors in the preparation of the final draft and eight of these thematic reviews were selected for publication in this volume. Through these regional and thematic reviews, the GCA +20 recognized a series of needs and challenges for the future development of sustainable aquaculture and the conference proposed a range of solutions, including improving aquaculture practices to reduce environmental impacts, strengthening governance and regulatory frameworks, and promoting social responsibility in the industry. The conference also emphasized the importance of integrating aquaculture into broader agri-food systems, including the use of innovative technologies that can increase productivity and reduce waste. The conference further recognized the need for greater investments in research and development to support the sustainable growth of the industry. This included improving breeding programs to enhance the health and resilience of farmed types and species, developing new feed formulations to reduce reliance on wild fish stocks, and advancing technologies that can improve efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. A key output from the GCA +20\u2014the Shanghai Declaration on Aquaculture for Food and Sustainable Development\u2014highlights the principles and strategic pathways to maximize sustainable aquaculture in achieving the SDGs, with a special focus on \u201cLeaving no one behind\u201d (FAO, 2022a, Annex S1). 2 PRODUCTION TRENDS FAO collects data on production from aquaculture and capture fisheries via annualized reporting from Member countries. These data are the most reliable and comprehensive basis for determining trends in production, although it should be noted that mechanisms for reporting aquatic food production are not always comparable with terrestrial livestock production in particular. For example, because of their emphasis on unprocessed wet weights, aquaculture and capture fisheries production values are not directly comparable in terms of edible animal sourced foods (Edwards et al., 2019). Total aquaculture production in 2021 comprised 90.9 million tonnes of aquatic animals and 35.2 million tonnes of algae, which when combined with 1900 tonnes of shells and pearls, accumulated to the highest ever total of aquaculture production at 126 million tonnes live weight with an estimated farm gate value of USD 296.5 billion (FAO, 2023a). Farmed finfish represents the greatest proportion of this production (47.1%) with a further 27.9%, 14.6% and 9.4% made up by seaweeds, mollusks, and crustaceans, respectively. Global aquaculture is unevenly distributed, with Asia being the main producer representing, in 2020, 91.6% of global production (and 85% of value). China accounts for 56.7% of global aquatic animal production and 59.5% of algal production (FAO, 2022b). The Americas, Europe, and Africa account for respectively 3.6%, 2.7%, and 1.9% of global production. It is often cited that aquaculture represents the fastest growing food production sector over recent decades with an average annual growth rate of 6.7% over the past three decades (FAO, 2022b). As aquaculture matures and production figures rise, however, this rate of growth is slowing, with an annual average growth of 3.5% for the period 2016\u20132021. In absolute terms, aquaculture production is still growing very significantly at nearly 19 million tonnes per annum. When considering fed and unfed aquaculture (e.g., filter feeding mollusks and finfish, and seaweeds), the former is the principal driver of aquaculture growth. Fed aquaculture represented 60% of production in 2000 and now represents 72.2%. Absolute levels of production for non-fed species have remained relatively constant over recent decades (FAO, 2022b). Marine and coastal aquaculture represents the largest percentage of aquaculture (55.5%), with the remainder being freshwater aquaculture. Nearly all algal production, the vast majority of mollusk production, and more than half of crustacean production come from marine environments. Freshwater aquaculture dominates in finfish production, representing 85.0% of global totals in 2021 (FAO, 2023a). On a global scale, aquaculture accounts for 49.2% of total aquaculture and fisheries production, with proportions varying geographically and across different production sectors. In Asia, aquaculture makes up 61.9% of total production compared with less than 7% for Africa when Egypt, the region's major aquaculture producer, is excluded (FAO, 2022b). Aquaculture production exceeds capture fisheries production for all sectors except marine finfish, which remains dominated by capture fisheries. Aquaculture production also exceeds capture fisheries production in middle-income countries, whereas capture fisheries predominate in low-income and high-income countries. While FAO Member countries have reported farming 710 species or species items since recording began (FAO, 2023a), they report current production of nearly 450 species or species items (FAO, 2020). However, data from the State of the World's Aquatic Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (FAO, 2019) indicated close to 700 species are currently being cultured. A relatively small number of species predominate with 50% of aquaculture production by volume constituted by just 12 species or species items including three seaweeds, six finfish species, two mollusks, and one crustacean. Aquaculture is estimated to directly employ 20.6 million producers, with 28% being women, compared with capture fisheries that employ 18% women. A relatively higher proportion of women are employed in the post-harvest sector in both capture fisheries and aquaculture. Clearly, the high growth rates of aquaculture production over recent decades, compared with the relatively stagnant production levels from capture fisheries, mean that aquaculture has been the predominant contributor to meeting the demand created by the doubling of global per capita fish consumption since 1960. Aquatic food consumption is expected to continue to rise for the next decade at approximately 1.4% perannum which is, by comparison, higher than that anticipated for red meat consumption (1% per annum). Growth in aquaculture production is expected to slow slightly in the coming decade, mainly because of increasing feed costs and the impact of policy changes in China (OECD\/FAO, 2022). It is expected that 90% of this production will be for consumption as aquatic food. Apparent aquatic food (excluding seeweed) consumption globally is projected to reach 21.4 kg per capita in 2031, up from the baseline of 20.5 kg per capita (average 2019\u20132021). Per capita consumption will increase in all continents except Africa, the region with the fastest growing population (OECD\/FAO, 2022). By 2030, aquaculture is projected to produce substantially more than capture fisheries (by around 6 million tonnes). In terms of total production, aquaculture will surpass capture fisheries in 2023 and by 2030 aquaculture will represent 52% of all aquatic animal production (i.e., excluding aquatic plants). It is difficult to anticipate and project future production trends for individual species or species groups. Figure 1 illustrates average annual growth rates for key species groups contributing significantly to global production. The highest rates of growth are for higher value species such as salmonids and shrimps\/prawns, but the greatest volumes of production and the highest rates of absolute growth in production come from the lower value species such as the carps. Evidence from terrestrial agriculture suggests that high volume production evolves for a relatively small number of species. Cai et al. (2022) point to an overall deceleration of species diversification in aquaculture although trends are regionally diverse. They predict this trend to continue with concentration of production on some of the key aquaculture species. FIGURE 1 Growth in world aquaculture production by major species groups (2019\u20132021). (Source: OECD\/FAO, 2022) . 3 THE ROLE OF AQUACULTURE IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS Recent, in-depth, global reviews of the rapid progress of aquaculture over the past decade toward increased environmental responsibilities and resource conservation (Boyd et al., 2020; Naylor et al., 2021) lay a new foundation for aquaculture's future contributions to the SDGs (Troell et al., 2023). The potential of aquaculture development throughout the world at all scales is now included in the assessments of the future of aquatic food or \u201cblue foods\u201d, or in a \u201cblue transformation\u201d, by international agencies, university centers, governments, nongovernmental and philanthropic organizations (CEA Consulting, 2020; Crona et al., 2023; Costello et al., 2019; FAO, 2022c; HLPE, 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019; O'Shea et al., 2019; SAPEA, 2017; Stuchtey et al., 2020). Transdisciplinary assessments of both fed and unfed aquaculture systems have shown that many types of aquaculture systems produce products of higher nutritional values and altogether aquaculture accounted for less than 1% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2017, similar to emissions from sheep production (Gephart et al., 2016, 2021; Hallstr\u00f6m et al., 2019; MacLeod et al., 2020). However, significant socio\u2013cultural inequities lead to food justice inequality and consequently political opposition to aquaculture exists, which poses serious obstacles to its expansion and growth (Brugere et al., 2023; Carter, 2018; Krause et al., 2015). As emphasized by Troell et al. (2023), a more in-depth understanding by policymakers and investors of the \u201cextraordinary diversity of aquaculture, both species and systems, becomes crucial for development of the sector's present and future contributions to the different SDGs\". Aquaculture touches every one of the SDGs; and its scaling involves every socio\u2013political dimension. As a result, the future expansion of aquaculture systems, and their abilities to play a greater role to achieve the SDGs, will require a greater integration with a wider diversity of economic and environmental professions engaged in planning and investments in the broader terrestrial\/aquatic food\u2013water\u2013energy nexus, and the natural resource, rural development, and human health system communities. Outstanding examples of aquaculture's benefits to rural communities and health food system economies exist when such engagement and planned integrations have been developed (Hernandez et al., 2017). Troell et al. (2023) emphasizes this point, stating, \u201cHaving a broader value-chain perspective will be imperative for gaining deeper insights about aquaculture's overall contribution to the SDGs, for understanding outcomes from investments and transformation efforts especially in diversifying supply chains and livelihoods\u201d. The IPCC Sixth Synthesis Report (AR6) released in March 2023 (Lee et al., 2023) documents that during the last decade (2010\u20132019), GHG emissions continued to increase \u201cfrom unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, causing many weather and climate extremes\u2026and led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society, related losses and damages to nature and people\u201d. Over 90% of human food production comes from terrestrial agriculture, which accounts for an estimated one third of all GHG emissions (Gilbert, 2012). Expansion of terrestrial agriculture, to provide the projected need for foods to 2050, has serious resource and environmental constraints. If relied upon to the exclusion of aquaculture's options, further unacceptable destruction of the Earth's remaining natural ecosystems and reserves from deforestation, conversions of grasslands, expansion of water irrigation systems, etc. will occur (Costa-Pierce, 2016). There are many proven options known for decades to integrate aquaculture efficiently and sustainably into terrestrial food systems. Expansion of these into Africa is a priority of the CGIAR systems and its WorldFish center (worldfishcenter.org). With the expansion of aquaculture technologies and global economies, land (e.g., recirculating aquaculture systems, RAS) and ocean-based aquaculture food systems developments will need to be integrated with emerging renewable energy systems at all scales (Buck & Langan, 2017; Scroggins et al., 2022; Vo et al., 2021). In addition, as tourism is estimated to account for upwards of 30% of the global economy, development of aquaculture tourism will not only assist in the economic viability of farming livelihoods but in the education of communities in areas of the world where aquaculture is new. Fisheries and aquaculture interact in many ways, for example with fishers shifting from fishing to aquaculture, and also operate in the same markets with similar products. Thus, the effective integration of planning and management of the two sectors is vital to their future development and sustainability. Klinger et al. (2013) recognized that ocean food systems (OFS) of fisheries and aquaculture cannot be separated but are increasingly \u201chybrid seafood systems\u201d whose products enter a common marketplace. Capture fisheries and aquaculture are researched, planned, and managed throughout the world as if they are independent entities ignoring their complex and evolving interdependencies. Such divisions and binary management approaches do not fit the current realities, opportunities, and innovations in hybrid OFS, and do not integrate knowledge across professions. Integration of knowledge across professions is needed to make better decisions on ocean food interventions that would incorporate data on rural economic development, producers and their mixed ocean\/land-based livelihoods, seasonal employment patterns, tourism, marketing, trade, and consumer behaviors. In the coming decade a greater diversity of hybrid OFS will likely evolve with accelerated climate and social changes, and their system complexities, intimate interactions in global-to-local marketplaces, and contributions to advancing mixed, rural livelihoods will need more attention. Integration of knowledge across professions will be needed to make better decisions on the appropriate development of aquaculture as an aquatic food intervention. Assessments will need to incorporate data on rural economic development, producers and their mixed aquatic\/ocean\/land-based livelihoods, seasonal employment patterns, tourism, marketing, trade, and consumer behaviors (Costa-Pierce, 2023). Lastly, the expansion of aquaculture requires technologies, investments, and policies that will not only benefit industries and communities but also mitigate impacts or even restore adjacent natural ecosystems. The Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture (EAA) laid an important foundation for this work in the last decade (FAO, 2010), but progress has been slow (Brugere et al., 2019). New guidelines, policies, and applied science being led by global nongovernmental organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and their partners in \u201crestoration, regenerative, conservation, and ecological\u201d aquaculture offers new sustainable expansion pathways to aquaculture in the coming decades (Alleway et al., 2018, 2023; Jones et al., 2022; TNC, 2021; World Economic Forum, 2023). At the same time, governments now increasingly recognize and support new examples of international cooperation and partnerships for new models of sustainable aquaculture development. An example is the new Center for Ecological Aquaculture at Shanghai Ocean University in P.R. China, which was established as a result of, and commitment to, the GCA +20 process, pays particular attention to the ecological dimension of aquaculture development, and will facilitate implementation and upscaling of agro-ecological and nutrition-sensitive approaches through integrated agriculture\u2013aquaculture (Dabbadie et al., 2019). FAO Members \u201cencouraged FAO to work in partnership with such initiatives to promote sustainable aquaculture, emphasizing the importance of the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture, and requesting technical assistance for its implementation\u201d (FAO, 2022d). FAO is incorporating the concept specifically into their global Guidelines on Sustainable Aquaculture currently under review. 4 KEY OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES FROM THE GCA +20 The thematic reviews provided an evidence base for the GCA +20 and supported the drafting of the Shanghai Declaration on Aquaculture for Food and Sustainable Development (Annex S1). The conference culminated in the adoption of the Shanghai Declaration by the participants and this was followed by the tabling of statements of support by government agencies, national and international organizations, the private sector, and civil society.1 The Shanghai Declaration provides a road map to optimize the role that aquaculture can play in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It provides the shared vision of conference participants of sustainable aquaculture, five overarching commitments, 10 strategic priorities, and a call for action. In summary, the Shanghai Declaration recommends stakeholders make a series of overarching commitments toward achieving the vision for sustainable aquaculture including: promoting responsible aquaculture development and good governance; strengthening partnerships to generate and share knowledge, information and technology; investing in aquaculture innovation, research, and development; and creating open and transparent communication. The Declaration identified calls to action on 10 strategic priorities to accelerate sustainable aquaculture development and its contribution to the SDGs: Expand the contribution of aquaculture to sustainable agri-food systems for nourishing nations, reducing poverty, and providing healthy, nutrient-rich, and climate-friendly food to people. Integrate aquaculture with the natural environment, agriculture, capture fisheries, forestry, tourism, renewable energy, and other sectors, and within agri-food systems for increased resilience. Continually improve the performance of aquaculture, and its capacity to minimize impact on, make better use of natural resources, and enhance ecosystem services. Promote aquaculture development approaches that conserve and improve ecosystems and biodiversity and reduce the carbon intensity of food production systems. Protect and develop aquaculture-based livelihoods and promote decent work and socially responsible enterprises. Ensure women's empowerment by enhancing women's full access to equal opportunities through gender-transformative policies. Promote opportunities for young women and men. Promote Indigenous Peoples' participation in aquaculture. Prepare for and potentially mitigate impacts from global crises, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and pandemics. Strengthen data and information collection and analysis for monitoring the progress and contributions of aquaculture. The unanimous adoption of the Declaration by the conference participants is an important milestone for global aquaculture, and all stakeholders are encouraged to consider it when working toward sustainable aquaculture. 5 FAO'S BLUE TRANSFORMATION The COFI Declaration for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (FAO, 2021) recognizes \u201cthe potential of aquaculture for further growth, particularly through innovative practices that support environmental stewardship, as well as the benefits of new and ongoing inclusive sustainable aquaculture development programs, and the need for investments to support capacity building, research, and extension services, with a particular attention to regions where population growth will challenge food systems most\u201d. The goal of FAO's Blue Transformation Roadmap 2022-2031 (FAO, 2022c), which aligns with the COFI Declaration, is to provide a basis for the provision of enough aquatic food for a growing population. This should be achieved in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable and equitable, and ensures the availability and accessibility of safe and nutritious aquatic food for all, in particular for vulnerable populations, and reduces food loss and waste. It should also ensure that aquatic food systems contribute to improving rights and income of vulnerable communities to achieve equitable livelihoods and support resilience in aquatic food systems that are highly influenced by dynamic anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic processes, including from a changing climate. In relation to aquaculture, the objective is to achieve the sustainable intensification and expansion of aquaculture in a way that satisfies global demand for aquatic food and distributes benefits equitably. This would be achieved through global and regional cooperation, effective planning and governance, application of technology and management, promotion of aquaculture operations that minimize environmental impact and use resources efficiently, and is supported by regular monitoring and reporting of the growth and impacts of aquaculture. Among the key tools proposed to support and promote sustainable growth of the sector are the Guidelines for Sustainable Aquaculture currently under preparation by FAO, which will provide a voluntary and non-binding framework for countries to drive forward the development of sustainable aquaculture.2 At present there is no universally agreed upon definition of sustainable aquaculture, but we recommend it be defined as \u201cthe practice of producing nutritious aquatic food and associated products in a manner that is environmentally and socially responsible, economically viable, and able to meet the needs of present and future generations. It involves using production systems and technologies that minimize negative impacts on the environment, and promote the long-term health and productivity of aquatic ecosystems, and support economically viable livelihoods that build vibrant communities, human health, and wellness.\u201d Sustainable aquaculture practices may include using low-impact farming methods, such as non-fed aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems, or integrated agriculture-aquaculture, to reduce the use of water and land resources and minimize waste. They may also involve sourcing feeds and other inputs from sustainable sources, conservation and effective management of aquatic biodiversity, minimizing the use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and ensuring high animal welfare standards. Sustainable aquaculture should not only be guided by technological and ecological advances but also by the development of robust governance frameworks, well-targeted policies, strategies and proper planning, and transparent, knowledge-based, predictable and enforceable legislation, underpinned by effective capacity building. Furthermore, sustainable aquaculture proactively considers social and economic factors, such as long-term profitability and competitiveness, fair labor practices and community involvement, and gender and racial equality, to ensure that the industry is not only environmentally sustainable but also socially responsible and economically viable in the long term. The thematic reviews presented in this important special issue of this journal provide greater detail and further key messages on the issues that need to be addressed to deliver on the GCA +20 vision and the Shanghai Declaration for the future of sustainable aquaculture. FAO looks forward to convening, with key partners, the next global conference in this series to measure progress and identify further the impacts of the various initiatives being promulgated in support of sustainable aquaculture development.

Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) Start a farm and sell produce directly to local consumers through a subscription-based CSA model. The Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) business model is a unique approach to agriculture that fosters a direct connection between farmers and their local communities. Rooted in the principles of mutual support and sustainable farming practices, CSA offers an alternative to conventional food production and distribution systems. In a CSA, members of the community become active participants in the agricultural process by purchasing shares or memberships directly from the farmer or farm cooperative. In return, they receive a regular supply of fresh, seasonal produce throughout the growing season. This model promotes transparency, accountability, and a sense of shared responsibility, as consumers have a direct stake in the success of the farm and the quality of the food they receive. CSA not only ensures a reliable market for farmers, but it also strengthens the local food system, promotes environmental stewardship, and builds stronger community bonds. By supporting local agriculture and enjoying the benefits of fresh, nutritious food, CSA members actively contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system for themselves and future generations. Fair Trade Coffee Shop Open a coffee shop that exclusively serves fair trade coffee, supporting small-scale farmers and promoting ethical sourcing. The Fair Trade coffee shop business model embodies a commitment to ethical sourcing, social responsibility, and sustainable practices. Fair Trade principles ensure that coffee farmers in developing countries receive fair prices for their crops, enabling them to improve their livelihoods and invest in their communities. In a Fair Trade coffee shop, every cup of coffee served is sourced from certified Fair Trade cooperatives or small-scale farmers who adhere to rigorous social, environmental, and economic standards. By establishing direct relationships with these producers, Fair Trade coffee shops foster transparency and long-term partnerships based on mutual respect and trust. Beyond sourcing, Fair Trade coffee shops prioritize creating a positive impact throughout their entire supply chain. They emphasize environmentally friendly practices, such as using organic or shade-grown coffee beans and promoting sustainable farming methods that preserve biodiversity. These shops also strive to provide fair and safe working conditions for their own employees, paying fair wages, offering training and development opportunities, and cultivating a supportive work environment.

These establishments serve as catalysts for change, inspiring other businesses to adopt fair trade principles and driving industry-wide transformation towards a more equitable and sustainable coffee trade. Recycling and Upcycling Establish a business that collects and repurposes recyclable materials or transforms waste into valuable products. The recycling and upcycling business model champions the ideals of environmental sustainability, resource conservation, and creative innovation. It operates on the premise that waste can be transformed into valuable resources through innovative processes and products. Recycling involves the collection and processing of materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal to be reprocessed into new products. On the other hand, upcycling takes the concept further by repurposing discarded materials into higher-value items with enhanced functionality or aesthetic appeal. Recycling and upcycling businesses play a crucial role in diverting waste from landfills and reducing the environmental impact of production processes. By collecting and processing recyclable materials, these businesses contribute to the conservation of natural resources, the reduction of energy consumption, and the prevention of pollution associated with the extraction and manufacturing of virgin materials. Furthermore, by upcycling materials that would otherwise be considered waste, they encourage creativity and offer sustainable alternatives to conventional products. Skill Training for Underprivileged Youth Provide vocational training and employment opportunities to disadvantaged young individuals, empowering them with marketable skills. The Skill Training for Underprivileged Youth business model focuses on empowering and uplifting disadvantaged young individuals by providing them with essential skills and training opportunities. This model recognizes that access to quality education and vocational training can be a transformative force in breaking the cycle of poverty and creating sustainable livelihoods. The business model typically involves partnering with local communities, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to identify underprivileged youth who lack access to formal education or vocational training. Through various training programs, these young individuals are equipped with practical skills and knowledge that are in demand in the job market. The training may encompass a wide range of fields such as computer literacy, technical skills, entrepreneurship, communication, and personal development. To sustain the model, the business seeks support through grants, sponsorships, and partnerships with corporations, foundations, and government entities that share a commitment to social impact. These collaborations provide financial resources, infrastructure, and expertise necessary for delivering effective training programs. Additionally, the business may also explore revenue-generating avenues, such as offering fee-based training services to individuals or organizations outside the target group. The success of this business model lies in its ability to provide not only technical skills but also comprehensive support to underprivileged youth.

Sustainable packaging companies often work closely with product manufacturers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms to integrate sustainable packaging solutions into their operations. This collaboration may involve providing consulting services, customized packaging designs, and supply chain management to ensure the successful implementation of sustainable packaging strategies. Microfinance Initiatives Create a microfinance organization that provides small loans and financial services to aspiring entrepreneurs in low-income communities, enabling them to start or expand their businesses. The microfinance business model revolves around providing financial services to individuals and small businesses who lack access to traditional banking services. It aims to address financial inclusion, alleviate poverty, and promote entrepreneurship by offering small loans, savings accounts, and other financial products tailored to the needs of underserved communities. At the core of the microfinance initiatives business model is the belief in the potential and capabilities of individuals to lift themselves out of poverty given access to financial resources. These initiatives typically target low-income individuals, marginalized groups, and micro-entrepreneurs who face barriers in accessing formal financial institutions due to lack of collateral, limited credit history, or geographical constraints. Microfinance initiatives operate by establishing specialized financial institutions, such as microfinance banks, credit unions, or non-profit organizations. These institutions provide small loans, often referred to as microcredit, to individuals and businesses to support income-generating activities, expand existing businesses, or cover emergency expenses. In addition to credit, microfinance initiatives may also offer savings accounts, insurance products, and financial education to empower individuals with financial knowledge and resilience. To sustain the microfinance initiatives business model, a combination of funding sources is typically utilized. This may include a mix of commercial investments, grants, donations, and government support. Additionally, microfinance institutions often operate on a self-sustaining model, where the interest earned from loan repayments helps cover operational costs and further expand the reach of financial services.","filter_flag":1}

Q: What technology innovations have you seen recently that you think are making a big difference? Are you seeing more use of wearable technologies? A: Jonathan McCallum, market segment manager, occupational health \u2013 industrial hygiene Absolutely, there are 2 products that I would like to share. The first is the SlateSafety Band V2 wearable designed to complement Heat Stress programs. The device is easy-to-use out of the box and provides key metrics like Exertion, Heart Rate, Core Temperature, GPS location, and SOS TapAlert for emergency notification if a wearer requires assistance. The Band V2 collects, transmits, and alerts on critical data in real-time via Bluetooth, Cellular, and GPS. The second is the Svantek SV104A Noise Dosimeter. What makes this device special is the patented MEMS microphone with lifetime warranty, optional frequency analysis and audio recording features, and Bluetooth connectivity with a Smartphone App that allows the results to be viewed without interrupting the worker. Another innovation with this product is the introduction of post-processing software that allows the user to perform secondary analysis on high-noise, high-impact, or no-motion events to determine if they belong in the sampling calculations. Advertisement Q: Can you tell us about any new materials or designs being used to improve the effectiveness of PPE? A: Leslie Molin, market segment manager \u2013 personal Safety With the summer temperatures upon us there are a couple of great products that can help with heat stress. The MSA V-Gard C1 Hard Hat uses patent-pending ReflectIR Thermal Barrier technology to keep the inside of the hard hat up to 20\u00b0F (11\u00b0C) cooler in sunny weather, making it the coolest hard hat on the market compared to those without ReflectIR. As well the full brim provides additional shade and sun protection. Dragonwear offers the Pro-Dry FR T-Shirt in both men and women\u2019s styles. Next to skin is becoming its own category of PPE and helps with the challenges of moisture management. These shirts are highly breathable and have a SILVERPLUS application that delivers antimicrobial coverage that provides odour control. Q: How has COVID impacted the development of new PPE products for workplace safety? A: Gary Rae, market segment manager \u2013 confined space One of the things that came out of Covid is an increased awareness in respiratory protection and an appreciation of the need to choose the right kind of protection and to ensure that the respirator fits the user. The average person had no idea what an N95 respirator was or that there are CSA standards for designing and manufacturing of the respirators themselves and for the detailed programs that must be followed for users of respirators. Another thing we learned was that these can be extremely uncomfortable and dangerous if not fitted properly. Covid brought out the best and the worst and shortages led to some questionable products coming in from all over the world. We were in a position where our sister Company NL Technologies was able to pivot and put the machinery in place to manufacture high quality Canadian made medical masks and to complete the introduction of our own Canadian made N95 respirator called Pleats Plus. The fit and comfort of the Pleats Plus is second to none. Our hope going forward is that \u201cMade in Canada\u201d means something. Respiratory protection programs have always been a cornerstone of our success as a Safety Company. This increased awareness has kept us extremely busy. A: Jonathan McCallum, market segment manager, occupational health \u2013 industrial hygiene Covid has certainly raised the awareness of respiratory health and one development includes the integration of spirometry into the health surveillance portion of more respiratory protection programs in Canada. The addition of the \u201cNew\u201d EasyOne Filter guarantees highly accurate measurements while ensuring high filter efficiency, low flow resistance, and minimal dead space volume. Q: Have there been improvements to the comfort of PPE to help ensure workers wear it properly? A: Gary Rae, market segment manager \u2013 confined space One area of vast improvement has been in fall protection. Harness manufacturers have gone a long way to answer the demand for comfort and fit and not just performance and compliance. The leading manufacturers are recognizing the different sizes and shapes of an ever-evolving workforce and for the need to ensure that the product they make addresses the increased safety provided to a worker wearing a properly fitted and comfortable harness. While bound by the performance standards outlined by the CSA Standard, they have been able to provide numerous design improvements that can adapt to every worker. The old \u201cH\u201d style chest design that was the standard has evolved to include \u201cX\u201d and \u201cV\u201d chest strap designs for greater freedom of movement and comfort as have the types of leg designs and configurations. The addition of different types of padding options have increased comfort and the addition of numerous types of hardware have increased the ease of adjustability and reduced weight. Additions and options such as suspension trauma straps, lanyard keepers and special connectors for SRD\u2019s add even more to the safety and comfort of what they now offer. Sizing and comfort has been taken into consideration across the full spectrum of price points, not just the premium products. A prime example is the MSA V-series (both ends of price spectrum shown). Q: How are manufacturers making their PPE more sustainable and easier to dispose of\/recycle if appropriate? A: Leslie Molin, market segment manager \u2013 personal safety Sustainable options are certainly growing. In the Hearing category Biobased earplugs by Final Fit Safety. The earplugs are USDA certified 82% biobased. Everything is biobased \u2013 the earplug, the cord, and even the bag (its made from Canadian corn!). These earplugs start to breakdown within a year vs. 100 years for traditional earplugs. Their Pinch-Fit designs has eliminated the need to roll the earplug, you just pinch it and insert into the ear canal. In hand protection Watson Gloves has a full line of WasteNot gloves made of recycled PET bottles. The 379 Stealth Phoenix offers a Cut A4, puncture ANSI 3 and features a reinforces thumb saddle and touchscreen compatible fingertips. A: Derek McEwen, marketing segment manager \u2013 fire systems and mining technology To help with PPE recycling we work with TerraCycle to recycle used PPE. TerraCycle is on a mission to eliminate waste. They take items such as disposable mask, gloves, earplugs, disposable coveralls, and safety glasses and reuse the materials to create plastic lumber, composite decking, floor tiles and playground surface covers. The process is simple, order the Zero waste box from Levitt Safety, collect the used accepted PPE, ship the box directly back to TerraCycle and they will do the rest. A great way to support environmental stewardship. Q: Any new products that work really well for ergonomics and preventing MSIs? A: Jonathan McCallum, market segment manager, occupational health- industrial hygiene Interest in Hand-Arm and Whole-Body Vibration along with HAVS awareness has been gaining momentum in Canada and we have recently introduced some innovative solutions. The Svantek SV103 Hand-Arm and SV100A Whole-Body monitors help safety professionals understand the workplace exposures and risks for various tasks. These are complemented with the addition of the Reactec R-Link HAV watch and analytics platform. This platform allows a workplace to validate risk assessments, control daily workplaces exposures, and identify preventative control measures such as training or tool selection. The watch can also be used as a proximity warning device to alert workers when they are too close to dangerous locations or mobile equipment. Q: What about products for women, or non-standard body sizes \u2013 are manufacturers responding to those needs? A: Leslie Molin, market segment manager \u2013 personal safety It\u2019s great to see with manufacturers developing PPE specifically for women. Several manufacturers are now putting women in charge of design process. Surewerx has their Pioneer brand of PPE that is specifically designed for women. Brand new to this line is the Hi-Vis Surveyor\u2019s Safety Vest and 7-in-1 Jackets. The vest tailored for a woman, features 15 pockets, is water-repellent, and tear resistant and comes in comes in 8 sizes. The 7-in-1 Waterproof Jacket designed for a woman and provides the flexibility for changing weather. Brand new to the market is Superior Gloves Endura 370DTIGL \u2013 Deer skin TIG welding gloves sized for ladies are designed with a cushioned patch on the pinky side to improve longevity and comfort while welding and sewn with DuPont Kevlar fiber to reduce the likelihood of getting burnt out when exposed to heat. The deer skin leather provides a high combination of durability, dexterity, and a fine sense of touch without forfeiting flexibility. Lakeland has introduced a great line of FR\/AR women\u2019s apparel that includes long sleeve crew and Henley style knits as well as dual certified lightweight pants. It\u2019s the variety of sizing that is truly appreciated. The knits come in regular and tall versions and the pants offer 4 different inseams which enables women to find their correct size. Maternity wear is brand-new to the marketplace and an exciting development. Covergalls is leading the way with their new line of maternity workwear. The collection includes a button-up work shirt and cargo pant. The work shirt features a longer front to safety cover a growing belly and a tab hem with 2 snaps that allow the wearer to adjust the shirt waist as their body grows. The cargo pant has a rib knit front panel and high waist design. It\u2019s great to see innovation and additional options for women in the workplace. In footwear, Royer uses a women\u2019s last which is a women\u2019s foot mould for safety boots. There offering also addresses breathability and durability. We\u2019ve had positive feedback from women when we show these boots at tradeshows. Q: If you had to pick one new product that is the \u201ccoolest\u201d or the biggest game changer over the last year or so, what would you say? A: Jonathan McCallum, market segment manager, occupational health \u2013 industrial hygiene The introduction of the Trolex Air XS Silica Monitor would certainly fit in this category. The Air XS is designed to provide detailed, accurate, real-time data on airborne RCS that will allow workplaces to act on live data where and when required. Measured information can be viewed via the instrument display or as historical readings via the accompanying application software.
