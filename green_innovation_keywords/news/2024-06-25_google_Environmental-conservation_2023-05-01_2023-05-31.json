The company is set to introduce its premium gin and Salud bitters to the Indian market next month. India's RTD alcohol market is projected to grow at an 11.2 per cent CAGR from 2022-2030. It has become increasingly popular among Gen-Z and millennials, who seek more convenient and healthy drink options that are low in sugar. Salud delivered 25,000 to 30,000 cases to the RTD market in the last fiscal year. Building on this success, it plans to invest $1.5 million to fuel growth in the alco-beverage market further. Moreover, the brand is expanding its product range by introducing three stock-keeping units (SKUs) based on distinct spirits, catering to a broader range of consumer preferences. The brand aims to establish a strong presence in key regions across India, including Karnataka, Goa, Telangana, Maharashtra, Orissa, Pondicherry, Kerala, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Chandigarh. By targeting smaller and larger states, it wants to cater to a diverse range of consumers, offering its fashionable lifestyle and premium products to a wide audience. Ajay Shetty, CEO of Salud Beverages, said, \"Our fashion-forward brand combines tradition and modernity, delivering exceptional drinking experiences. As we expand, our sole focus is the Indian market, where we aim to source and produce everything locally.\" Salud has established a distillery facility in Goa that incorporates canning technology, enabling it to introduce recyclable cans for its products. By prioritising cans over bottles, it is committed to environmental conservation by taking sustainable packaging seriously. The Bengaluru-based start-up also claims to be the first Indian brand to incorporate Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) to offer an immersive experience to its customers. Besides its RTDs and non-alcoholic bitters, its Salud Merchandise is an exclusive line of clothing, while its music IP Salud Sessions holds exclusive tracks by various homegrown and international artists. Both these business divisions will launch new collections soon. In September 2021, Salud Beverages raised $1.1 million from investors, including actor Rana Daggubati, former managing director of Microsoft India Srinivas Koppolu, and Anthill Ventures. Earlier this year, global venture capital firm Anthill Ventures launched Anthill Spirits, a speed-scaling accelerator programme dedicated to supporting early-stage alco-bev start-ups. It aimed at providing funding and market access to entrepreneurs in India\u2019s rapidly growing alco-bev industry, which is estimated to be around $50 billion by 2023.","filter_flag":1}

It embraces the profound Rajasthani ethos of cherishing beauty in scarcity while championing sustainability. The arid climatic conditions observed in Godawan contribute to a heightened \"Angel's share\" phenomenon, imparting an extraordinary flavour profile that enthrals the senses. To enhance its allure further, this exceptional whisky undergoes meticulous maturation in carefully selected casks infused with Indian botanicals. Godawan 100 Godawan, from Diageo India, country's leading beverage company, introduced Godawan Century, a bespoke 100-bottles-batch of limited-edition Single Malt, that pays homage to the Great Indian Bustard, popularly known as Godawan, on its first anniversary. The bird was once a ubiquitous sight across India but has now dwindled to just a little over hundred in number. Every single addition to the Godawan flock counts, and the brand is working wholeheartedly for the environmental conservation and ecological preservation of the bird. Godawan 100 marked the occasion with a mystical event held at Alila Fort, Bishangarh, Rajasthan, close to the natural habitat of the Godawan bird and the home of the spirit. Maharawal Chaitanya Raj Singh, the 44th King of Jaisalmer, known for his conservation efforts of the local heritage, joined in the celebration. The one-day immersive experience offered 30 guests a glimpse into the story of Godawan, accompanied with the sounds of Nagadas, besides an evening of four-course culinary experience and a sewan-seed making conservation activity. The brand also partnered with Amit Pasricha, the renowned photographer whose platform \"India Lost & Found\" pays an ode to timeless Indian monuments, once forgotten and now waiting to be rediscovered. Just like Pasricha and India Lost & Found call for the preservation of the heritage, a reminder of India's beautiful past, so does the rare and exclusive Godawan 100 collection, for the conservation of Godawan birds. The attendees of the grand product unveil were given exclusive Amit Pasricha prints as a memento. Godawan 100 is also an ode to the local Bishnoi community's tireless work towards the conservation of the Godawan bird, once in the running to be the national bird of India. Each bottle of Godawan 100 is unique, with a bespoke label that has a distinctive image of the bird. The case for each bottle has been mindfully crafted from old, bourbon casks that were once used for the maturation of the liquid. Shweta Jain, Chief Business Development Officer: Luxury, Reserve & Craft \u2013 India and South Asia, Diageo India, said, \"In a world where discerning luxury consumers seek more than just premium products, Diageo India offers a holistic experience that embraces sustainability and responsible consumption. At the heart of it lies a deep appreciation for our rich heritage and a steadfast commitment to preserving it for future generations. In this spirit, we proudly present Godawan Century that embodies our values of mindful consumption and social consciousness.\" Expressing his thoughts on the launch, Vikram Damodaran, Chief Innovation Officer, Diageo India, said, \"Godawan Century is a remarkable artisanal single malt with the raison d'etre of conservation of an endangered species. Each bottle is unique with a distinctive image of the bird, and the cases have been created from old, discarded casks. The liquid captures the exceptional essence of Rajasthan. We are proud to partner local communities to conserve Godawan and invite our consumers to join us in this journey of responsible consumption and mindful luxury.\" \"Godawan Century celebrates not only the rich flavours of Rajasthan but also showcases Diageo's unwavering commitment to the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard. It is inspired by the authentic spirit of the desert and therefore, close to my heart, because Rajasthan is a true example of beauty in scarcity and conserving whatever nature gives us. We hope to ignite meaningful conversations about the importance of preserving this iconic bird and environmental conservation,\" said Maharawal Chaitanya Raj Singh, the 44th king of Jaisalmer on the launch of Godawan Century. \"Just as India Lost & Found works tirelessly to raise consciousness about India's forgotten past, Godawan Century hopes to drive the conservation about nearly extinct Godawan birds. We have been trusted with truly remarkable geo-cultural legacies, and they are worth preserving. Godawan Century is an exemplary example of mindful luxury that seeks to change the world for the better,\" said Amit Pasricha, renowned photographer, and Founder, India Lost & Found. Godawan Century offers a unique and immersive experience that celebrates the heritage, culture, and flavours of Rajasthan, which the Great Indian Bustard and the artisanal single malt call home. The launch of Godawan Century showcased the brand's dedication to mindful luxury and the efforts to create a positive impact on society and the environment. About the liquid: Double matured in American Ex Bourbon and European Oak Casks Made from Indian six-row barley Matured at Alwar 101-Degree F Dark amber liquid, with a sweet and creamy palate that has an intense richness of fruits and grapes. This limited-edition whiskey's essence is aligned with Diageo India's commitment towards Society 2030: Spirit of Progress Plan.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}
