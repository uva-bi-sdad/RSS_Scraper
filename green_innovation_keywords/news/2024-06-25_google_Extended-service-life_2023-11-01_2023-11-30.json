From the transformative impact of LiDAR systems in automation to the sustainability contributions of LEDs and innovative applications of opto-semiconductors in healthcare, Rao discusses the pivotal role of these technologies in shaping industries. Polymatech\u2019s focus on sapphire technology and government support reflects the company\u2019s commitment to driving innovation and addressing challenges in the rapidly evolving optoelectronics landscape. Read the full interview here: TimesTech: What are the key advancements in Optoelectronics technology expected in 2024, and how will they impact various industries? Mr. Eswara: In 2024, optoelectronics technology will witness remarkable advancements, profoundly impacting various industries. Automation takes centre stage as advanced optical sensors and LiDAR systems optimise autonomous machines, revolutionising logistics and manufacturing. Medical diagnostics and treatment follow, benefiting from non-invasive optical imaging technologies, promising enhanced patient care. In horticulture, specialised LED grow lights will foster efficient indoor farming practices. Finally, low-latency optical networks and 5G integration will transform communication, ushering in high-speed wireless connectivity. These innovations bring forth increased efficiency, precision, and sustainability across industries. Polymatech is trying to bring in LiFi Technology to India which will be a paradigm shift in data transmission. TimesTech: How are LEDs contributing to sustainability and energy efficiency, aligning with global eco-friendly lighting trends? Mr. Eswara: LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes) are pivotal in aligning with global eco-friendly lighting trends. Renowned for their energy efficiency, LEDs consume up to 90% less energy than traditional lighting1, significantly reducing environmental impact. Today, the use of sapphire technology in LED production has become a game-changer. It enhances longevity and performance consistency. While silicon wafers in LEDs tend to heat up quickly, sapphire wafers do not, offering a significant advantage. The integration of sapphire technology in LED production is a critical factor in enhancing their longevity and consistent performance. Polymatech focuses on manufacturing sapphire wafers with specific characteristics for high-quality, energy-efficient lighting and consumer electronics in India. These wafers, with their sapphire base and GaN crystals, not only meet the high demand for lighting and consumer electronics but also reduce the frequency of replacements, offering extended service life. LEDs, with their extended lifespan, significantly contribute to sustainability goals by reducing waste and resource consumption. Furthermore, opto-semiconductors are integral to solar plants, ensuring efficient energy capture and storage for green energy initiatives. TimesTech: Could you share examples of innovative Opto-semiconductor applications that are disrupting various industries? Mr. Eswara: Opto-semiconductors are driving transformative innovations across sectors, with profound implications for healthcare and medical equipment. 1. Advanced Diagnostic Imaging: Opto-semiconductor technologies play a pivotal role in advancing medical imaging techniques, enabling high-resolution, non-invasive tissue imaging for precise diagnostics in procedures like laparoscopy. Additionally, these technologies are employed in endoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT), empowering medical professionals to make accurate diagnoses and well-informed treatment decisions. 2. Sterile Environments: UV lighting utilising opto-semiconductor technology is revolutionising sterile environments, especially in operating theatres and food processing units. It ensures a high level of disinfection, enhancing safety and hygiene. 3. Precision Nerve Localisation: Opto-semiconductors facilitate precise nerve localisation, eliminating the need for extensive searches during numerous medical procedures. This innovation enhances surgical precision and reduces patient discomfort. 4. Advanced Surgical Instruments: Surgical instruments incorporating opto-semiconductor technology provide surgeons with enhanced precision and visualisation during minimally invasive procedures. This leads to quicker patient recovery and improved surgical outcomes. These applications highlight the transformative potential of opto-semiconductors in healthcare, offering improved patient care, research capabilities, and operational efficiency. TimesTech: What strategies do successful Opto-semiconductor companies use to address challenges and stay competitive in the market? Mr. Eswara: Government Investment: Initiatives like \u2018Make in India\u2019 and production-linked incentives can boost innovation and production, ensuring a competitive edge. This includes capital investments, manufacturing incentives, and the Design Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme, offering substantial support to startups in crafting products for both domestic and global markets. With government agencies\u2019 support, opto-semiconductor companies can better address challenges, encourage innovation, and maintain their competitive edge, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the industry. NER: For semiconductor industry, government support is very much needed. This is needed for importing all raw material which is very much new in to Indian authorities. Polymatech enjoys both Tamil Nadu and Government of India\u2019s full support without which we could not reach to this stage. As a policy Polymatech business plans are made without subsidies and incentives from government TimesTech: What insights can you provide for businesses and consumers making decisions about Opto-Semiconductors applications and products in 2024, considering the rapid technological evolution? Mr. Eswara: Opto semiconductors applications are plenty. As of now most of the chips are used in lighting. Polymatech is bringing several applications in to human life that make life easy. Details of which will be disseminated as and when new products are launched. 1 https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/energysaver\/lighting-choices-save-you-money","filter_flag":1}
