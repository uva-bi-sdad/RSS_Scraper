Pollination, founded five years ago by climate and environmental law expert Martijn Wilder, will hand-pick companies for up to $12 million in funding to develop prototypes or scale up to meet demand for new products. \u201cThis is a significant development that comes at the right time,\u201d Mr Wilder, who\u2019s also chair of the nation\u2019s $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund Corporation, said on Wednesday. With an undisclosed cornerstone commitment from Queensland Investment Corporation, Pollination\u2019s new fund will target energy, transport, food and agriculture, carbon and nature management, and the emerging circular economy of recycling and reuse. Pollination chief investment officer Diana Callebaut told AAP that those five areas had the most impact and potential in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re not as mature in our climate and nature investing as other jurisdictions which, again, provides a great opportunity for growth on a relative basis,\u201d Ms Callebaut said. She said Australia was \u201cvery attractive\u201d for early-stage investment and had an advantage in energy markets, carbon measurement and land regeneration, in particular. The fund expects to begin making investments in late 2024 and will take three to five years to allocate capital, with a heavier concentration in the early years and the prospect of reinvestment. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at investing 60 per cent of the capital and then leave 40 per cent to be able to top up our best opportunities,\u201d Ms Callebaut said. Pollination already has a stake in Australian climate technology firms and an East Kimberley partnership with a First Nations-led clean energy, green hydrogen and green ammonia export project. Carbon accountants FlintPro, seaweed farmer Sea Forest, sustainable foodies at Goterra, energy startup MGA Thermal and emissions platform Ruminati are on their books. QIC private equity investment director Lottie Tant said the new fund would support local innovators working on the global challenges of climate change and nature preservation. \u201cPollination\u2019s global footprint and deep climate expertise provides a specialist value-add to Queensland startups,\u201d Ms Tant said. She said the scale-up capital would go to proven and innovative climate technologies, with the landmark fund to help close a funding gap experienced by early-stage companies. The first Pollination-only fund, separate from a $US1 billion joint venture with HSBC, will be open to wholesale and institutional investors.

Researchers from the University of Stuttgart and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) used a pilot plant to demonstrate how sewage treatment plants can contribute to climate neutrality by recovering raw materials. \"The Teaching and Research Sewage Treatment Plant at the University of Stuttgart has an important objective: To extract valuable raw materials from wastewater and reintroduce them into the economic cycle. In this way, the organic carbon in the wastewater can be used sustainably. The research sewage treatment plant is also focused on reducing the high emissions of climate-damaging gases typically produced by conventional sewage treatment plants,\" said Minister President Winfried Kretschmann. \"But the innovation here is not just happening at a high level. The sewage treatment plant is also a training center for wastewater treatment plant personnel and supports companies in the development of plant technology. In this way, the sewage treatment plant facilitates the crucial transfer from science to practical application.\" Our wastewater not only contains dirt and excrement, but also valuable raw materials such as nitrogen and organic carbon compounds. With the help of chemical, biological and physical processes, these raw materials can be recovered from wastewater to make products such as fertilizer, hydrogen and bioplastics. The KoalAplan project (\u201cMunicipal wastewater as a source of ammonium nitrogen, hydrogen and bioplastics - the B\u00fcsnau biorefinery\u201d) has been researching this process since 2021. Scientists from the DVGW Research Center at the Engler-Bunte Institute of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the University of Stuttgart, the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology (IGB), the Technical University of Hamburg, and the Clausthal University of Technology are working on the KoalAplan project together with the State Agency for Environmental Technology and Resource Efficiency in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Umwelttechnik BW). The KoalAplan is funded by the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). It is part of the state strategy \u201cSustainable Bioeconomy for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u201d. At the B\u00fcsnau teaching and research sewage treatment plant at the University of Stuttgart, researchers are testing under real conditions how the recovery of raw materials in sewage treatment plants can be realized on an industrial scale. A biorefinery was set up as a pilot plant for this purpose, which has been operating successfully since 2023. During his visit on June 6, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's Minister President Winfried Kretschmann was briefed on the project's findings to date. Biorefinery Achieves Successful Continuous Operation Peter Maurer, Head of the Teaching and Research Sewage Plant at the University of Stuttgart, and Prof. Dr. Harald Horn, Coordinator of the KoalAplan project and Professor of Water and Water Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), gave Minister President Winfried Kretschmann and a group of media representatives a tour of the biorefinery and explained the process used. Normally, carbon dioxide is produced from the organic carbon when it passes through a sewage treatment plant. \u201cOur processes reduce the production of this climate-damaging gas. At the same time, we obtain raw materials that help to replace petroleum-based substances. With this two-pronged strategy, the sewage treatment plants of the future could make an important contribution to climate neutrality,\u201d says Prof. Dr. Harald Horn. Traditional wastewater treatment processes are being expanded with new components The wastewater treatment concept applied by the project group consists of chemical, physical and biological process steps. As part of the preliminary treatment, mechanical cleaning takes place first. Coarse matter is removed, and it is here that a third of the organic carbon is separated. A further third of the carbon is then separated from the main wastewater flow with the aid of ultra-fine micro-sieves. \u201cThe microsieves are a key part of our concept. The carbon obtained following this process is so highly concentrated that it can be used in biotechnology,\" says Professor Horn. Subsequently, ammonium nitrogen is removed from the main wastewater stream using an ion exchanger. The result is a product that can be used as a fertilizer. The filtered solids and the primary sludge are first converted into organic acids by acid hydrolysis in the side-stream process, which also produces biohydrogen and CO2. The hydrolysate is filtered and converted to hydrogen using microbial electrolysis. Hydrogen has many applications in the chemical industry and is regarded as a future energy source. In a feasibility study, gas flows from microbial electrolysis and dark fermentation are utilized in a biotechnological process to produce valuable chemicals. Additionally, the carbon dioxide generated is re-fixed during this process. The organic carbon remaining in the process of the microbial electrolysis cell is then fermented to form a basic material for bioplastics. Finally, the main stream wastewater follows the conventional treatment path: Remaining nitrogen and carbon are broken down in several stages, and any accumulating sludge ends up in the secondary clarifier, where methane is extracted. \"Since last year, our biorefinery has demonstrated through continuous operation that the process chain is effective and could therefore also be implemented in other sewage treatment plants,\u201d says Peter Maurer, head of the research sewage treatment plant. \u201cWe hope that we can use the pilot project to sensitize other companies to the potential of bioeconomic strategies. Our example shows that you can reduce the consumption of fossil raw materials and even save costs and market new products as a result.\u201d The Teaching and Research Sewage Treatment Plant in B\u00fcsnau At the B\u00fcsnau Teaching and Research Sewage Treatment Plant, students, doctoral students and research groups have been researching and experimenting with innovative processes for wastewater treatment on a semi-industrial and industrial scale since 1965. The teaching and research sewage treatment plant is affiliated to the Institute for Sanitary Engineering, Water Quality and Solid Waste Management at the University of Stuttgart. It is not used exclusively for research, but also treats the wastewater of 8,500 inhabitants of a Stuttgart district. Part of the main flow of the municipal wastewater is fed through the project's KoalAplan pilot plant.

Story continues A reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 financial outlook is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Aspen provides an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as a measure of operating performance because the non-GAAP financial measure does not include the impact of items that management does not consider indicative of Aspen's core operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) for planning purposes, including the preparation of Aspen's annual operating budget, (ii) to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business, and (iii) as a performance measure under its bonus plan. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects Aspen's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in its business, as it excludes expenses and gains not reflective of Aspen's ongoing operating results or that may be infrequent and\/or unusual in nature. Management also believes that this non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating Aspen's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of Aspen's GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Aspen's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, Aspen has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management strongly encourages investors to review Aspen's financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. About Aspen Aerogels, Inc.
