In the run-up to COP28, we spoke with Robert Metzke, Global Head of Sustainability, on how Philips has continued to make steps to embed sustainability and climate action in healthcare delivery. With its Scope 1 (internal) and Scope 2 (energy sourcing) emissions firmly under control, the company has turned its sights on partnering to reduce its Scope 3 emissions \u2013 those beyond its direct control \u2013 to ensure end-to-end value chain sustainability. In early 2023, Philips became the first health technology company to have its entire value-chain CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). What is Philips\u2019 focus at COP28? Robert Metzke: One of the best parts of my job is engaging with inspiring thinkers - from international organizations, governments, business companies and civil society - to learn from each other\u2019s expertise, share our own experience, embrace new ways of thinking and operating, and galvanize shared action to tackle global challenges. Our focus at COP28 is extending our sustainability impact with the healthcare industry by engaging with governments and partner stakeholders. In the healthcare industry, there\u2019s strong global momentum \u2013 a huge number of care providers recognize that they need to tackle their impact on the environment, in terms of both carbon emissions and beyond. In our conversations with hospitals, they tell us they want to commit to become carbon neutral. We can help them start and scale with our decades of experience, our in-house expertise, successful case studies and best practices. In healthcare, the main share of carbon emissions (71%) are indirect emissions caused by the production and transportation of goods and services that hospitals purchase, such as medicines, food, equipment, clothing, and waste treatment [1]. Reducing these is a big opportunity. The good news is that suppliers are also focused on this topic, where increasingly a combination of legislation, transparency, reporting pressure, and employees who prefer to work for sustainable companies is driving change. The critical part is the capability to act. Philips builds capabilities with its customer and suppliers, providing very practical help. What capabilities does Philips have to contribute the improving sustainability in healthcare? Robert: Underpinned by innovation, digitalization and collaboration, Philips\u2019 efforts to drive sustainable healthcare are based on 1) Energy efficiency within the company\u2019s own operations and across our product portfolio, with an added focus on reducing the amount of energy its products consume when in use; 2) Resource efficiency to maximize the value of our products and solutions over their lifetime, while minimizing material and resource use and reducing waste; 3) Care pathway optimization by co-creating new (digital and circular) health solutions that reduce healthcare\u2019s carbon footprint and enable the delivery of quality care to those who need it, especially in medically underserved communities. What approaches is Philips taking to achieve its energy and resource efficiency goals? Robert: Since 2020 our global operation is carbon neutral, using 100% renewable electricity. We continue to build new partnerships for renewable electricity.\u201d An example is the consortium led renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) through which Philips and global brewing company HEINEKEN agreed to purchase the output of energy company Cero Generation\u2019s new 70MW Pontinia agrivoltaic solar farm project in Lazio, Italy. The agricultural element of the project will also provide crop-growing experience and training to vulnerable and socially excluded people in the Lazio region. ","filter_flag":1}
