Sustainable Engineering: Supporting Smarter Innovation Effective sustainability prioritizes smart, regenerative use of resources.

Its soil, the amount of sun and water it receives, the property grade and the region all have an impact on how much and how often it requires watering. Expanding its revolutionary Smart Water Network \u2013 an integrated system of products working to monitor and enhance users' experiences with water in the home while facilitating water conservation \u2013 Moen is excited to bring its smart home technology to the area of the home where water is most used* with a Smart Sprinkler Controller and Smart Wireless Soil Sensors, together a 2023 CES Innovation Award Honoree. Moen launches Smart Sprinkler Controller and Smart Wireless Soil Sensors to provide simple, intelligent and affordable control over your home\u2019s irrigation system - all from the Moen Smart Water App. This simple, intelligent and affordable way to control a home's irrigation system is accessible from a smartphone app. With the Smart Sprinkler Controller's intelligent features, users can create custom watering schedules and control each zone independently so they can easily manage how much water each zone receives. They also can make seasonal adjustments, enable the weather-skip feature that automatically disables watering based on local weather data, and monitor both water usage and estimated savings. Moen's Smart Wireless Soil Sensors monitor precise data on zone moisture levels and are the only smart wireless soil sensors that work with the Moen Smart Sprinkler Controller. Unlike other soil sensors which require buried cables throughout the lawn, these sensors are simply inserted flush into the ground and then measure the soil moisture and temperature levels at 1-, 3- and 5-inch depths to determine if it is above or below the set thresholds. Measurements are communicated to the Moen Smart Sprinkler Controller to automatically adjust watering schedules when needed \u2013 and only in the zones required, reducing water waste and ensuring a happy, healthy lawn. \"Outdoor water use accounts for a tremendous amount of water each day, mainly for landscape irrigation,\" said Joy Trillet, associate product manager, Moen Smart Water Network. \"The Smart Sprinkler Controller and Smart Wireless Soil Sensors are an important expansion of Moen's Smart Water Network, providing users with peace of mind in knowing their outdoor irrigation system is being monitored 24\/7. In fact, the Smart Sprinkler Controller can reduce an average home's irrigation water use by up to 30 percent, saving the home up to 15,000 gallons of water annually compared to a clock-based controller \u2013 a major impact on money and water savings.**\" Both products are easy to install: the Smart Sprinkler Controller is installed in less than 30 minutes and retrofits to the existing irrigation system. The Smart Wireless Soil Sensors can be installed in under 5 minutes thanks to their sleek, wireless design and patented technology which allows them to be inserted flush into the lawn, removing the risk of damage from using lawn mowers or other yard mishaps. The Smart Sprinkler Controller is the only controller compatible with Moen's Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff \u2013 a device within the Smart Water Network that connects to the home's main water line to monitor its entire water supply system for leaks and vulnerabilities. By using the Controller, the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff will now recognize users' home sprinkler as another Moen device and will not shut off the home's water due to outdoor irrigation running. With this enhancement to the Smart Water Network, homeowners now have complete control over the water inside and outside their homes when they have both the Smart Sprinkler Controller and the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff. CES 2023 Stop by booth #52026 (Venetian Expo Halls A-D) at CES 2023 from January 5-8 to experience what's new with Moen and to see the products in action. They also will be on display at CES Unveiled at Mandalay Bay on January 3.

CLEAN SYNERGY With the need for cleanliness and hygiene at the forefront of consumers' minds, TOTO's new NEOREST Smart Bidet Toilets offer advanced cleaning technologies that work synergistically to keep the toilet bowl fresh and clean at all times: PREMIST \u00ae : The bowl's interior is sprayed with a fine water mist to reduce waste's ability to stick to its surface, which results in a better clean with every flush. : The bowl's interior is sprayed with a fine water mist to reduce waste's ability to stick to its surface, which results in a better clean with every flush.

EWATER+: The cleanliness of the bowl's surface, the interior and exterior of the WASHLET and NEOREST bidet wands, and the new NEOREST seat's underside are ensured by automatically misting them with electrolyzed water, a well-known cleaning agent, which reduces the need for harsh cleaning chemicals, which benefits the planet. Electrolyzed water is produced by electrolysis of the chloride ions in ordinary tap water. It is completely free of added chemicals and harsh cleaning agents. Over time, EWATER+ returns to its original state as regular tap water. New GB Shower Series Rain Showers TOTO introduces two new overhead rain shower designs to its GB Shower Series \u2013 square and round. The GB Shower Series Square Rain Shower measures 10 inches and is available with water-conserving flow rates of 1.75 GPM or 2.5 GPM. The GB Shower Series Round Rain Shower is available in designs that measure 10 inches or 12 inches. It flows at an eco-friendly 1.75 GPM or 2.5 GPM. TOTO's new GB Shower Series Rain Showers offer its COMFORT WAVE\u00ae water technology, which uses a unique nozzle design to add larger drops of water to the shower for a comfortable experience with just the right amount of stimulation. As a result, bathers feel as if they are encased in far more water than they are actually using. This makes their shower experience extremely pleasurable as it honors our water supply by reducing consumption. New GB Shower Series Body Spray with New Water Technology TOTO's new GB Shower Series Round Body Spray measures four inches in diameter and flows at a water-saving 1.5 GPM. It features two TOTO water technologies for the ideal showering experience. The new INTENSE WAVE\u00ae provides a more vigorous shower experience. Ideal for relaxing tired muscles or kickstarting your day, while COMFORT WAVE promotes recovery and regeneration any time of day. Switching from one mode to the other is easy; simply rotate the body spray's interior from right to left using the handy grip. New Commercial Toilet with TORNADO FLUSH TOTO's revolutionary new commercial toilet features its market-leading TORNADO FLUSH system, which provides a powerful nozzle to create 360 degrees of centrifugal, cyclonic rinsing action that reduces waste buildup and keeps the bowl cleaner as it effectively removes waste completely. TOTO's new commercial toilet is available in wall-mount and floor-mount models. Using only 1.0 or 1.28 gallons per flush (GPF), TOTO's high-efficiency TORNADO FLUSH system is more effective in one flush than most commercial toilets with multiple flushes. Its modern hole-free concave rim design means that TOTO's new high-efficiency commercial toilet performs consistently and is easy to clean. It is also available in a 1.6 GPF model. TOTO's new commercial toilet also offers CEFIONTECT, its super-smooth, nano-technology glaze that seals the porcelain with an ionized barrier, creating a super-slippery, non-porous surface that leaves waste nowhere to cling. It is also available without CEFIONTECT. Newly Improved ECOPOWER Flush Valve for Commercial Toilets TOTO has improved its touchless exposed and concealed ECOPOWER Flush Valve for commercial toilets. The new ECOPOWER Flush Valve functions effectively at 25 psi, making it ideal for buildings with lower water pressure. TOTO has also improved its sensor eye's strength and detection range. The new ECOPOWER Flush Valve's sensor eye is now 1.2 times stronger and has a broader detection range of 39-3\/8th inches. ECOPOWER technology generates electricity each time water spins a small internal turbine. This auto-generated electrical energy is stored in capacitors that power the flush valve. There is no minimum usage requirement. TOTO's ECOPOWER hydroelectric technology generates power during use. No need for hardwiring to the building's electrical system or routine battery replacement, which is costly and hazardous to the environment.

Pure Harvest will design, construct and operate high-tech, climate-controlled hybrid food production systems that allow year-round production of high-quality, safe, and sustainably-grown fresh fruits & vegetables, free of pesticides, offering Saudi consumers a constant availability of high-quality fresh produce that was never before possible due to the Kingdom's challenging arid climate. Nadec will utilize its existing infrastructure, far-reaching distribution network, and trusted consumer brands to deliver its partner's fresh produce to the market. This strategic alliance is closely aligned with the Kingdom's Vision for a more self-sufficient and sustainable food system. The parties completed and commissioned their first-ever project on December 29, 2021, producing over fifteen (15) varieties of high-quality, hydroponically-grown tomatoes in an approximately 6-hectare high-tech, climate-controlled growing system in Nadec City, Haradh, KSA. This sustainable tomato production facility is fully integrated into Nadec's existing infrastructure, including its innovative 30-MW captive solar farm. The groundbreaking project produces over 5 million kilograms of locally grown tomatoes per annum, harvesting daily throughout the full year, with peak production occurring during the harsh summer months, during which local production has historically been impossible, thus contributing directly to the Kingdom's food sovereignty. This innovative project is the first of many that the partners expect to develop together, integrating the full value chain of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) production. Pure Harvest seeks to deploy substantial production capacity over the next five (5) years in KSA, farming a wide range of crops, and Nadec will market these products to its expansive consumer base, hotels, restaurants, and catering partners. The partners share a vision to assist in the transition towards greater food security, water conservation, economic diversification, and sustainability in the Kingdom, as well as the broader GCC region. By originating large-scale, renewable energy-integrated food production infrastructure in KSA, Nadec and Pure Harvest are together making possible local-for-local high-quality, pesticide-residue free, clean, and healthy fresh fruits and vegetables production that, thanks to Pure Harvest's pioneering production technology, are \"always in season\" \u2013 proudly serving the Kingdom's citizens. Dr. Solaiman A. AlTwaijri, CEO of Nadec, stated: \"We are delighted to be partnering with Pure Harvest Smart Farms and to bring their distinctive controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) solutions and expertise to the Kingdom. Nadec has a long tradition of supplying a broad range of staple food products to both the Kingdom and the surrounding region. Moving into the supply of high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables is a natural extension of our legacy. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing safe, secure, local food supply for our customers, and this partnership is a new opportunity for us to delight those customers while at the same time making a momentous contribution to the country's food security and water conservation objectives. Nadec is proud to promote sustainable agricultural development in the Kingdom, in accordance with the ambitious goals of the Saudi Vision 2030, as well as the clear vision of our government.\" Sky Kurtz, Founder & CEO of Pure Harvest Smart Farms, added: \"We are honored to begin this partnership with Nadec. They are a formidable incumbent food supplier with a sterling reputation and brand, sizeable landholdings and enabling infrastructure, and an experienced leadership team. We greatly benefit from Nadec's strength, and together we are pioneering a new category of fresh produce for the Saudi people \u2013 premium local. High-quality, delicious, safe, and affordable fresh produce that is always in season\u2026 offering new varieties, new products, and a fundamentally novel fresh produce experience. Our purpose at Pure Harvest is to enable positive change through smart, sustainable farming, and Nadec shares this objective. We are grateful to work with Nadec to accelerate the Kingdom's vision towards a more sustainable future.\" Compared to traditional, lower-tech farming methods, Pure Harvest's novel resource-efficient food production systems have many advantages aligned with the Kingdom's Vision 2030 mandate to conserve resources and reduce carbon emissions. Other distinctive features of its systems include the absence of soil and pesticides, as well as leveraging information technologies to make the best possible production decisions while largely automating certain agricultural processes such as irrigation, pest control, and climate management. Pure Harvest's growing systems result in very low water consumption per kilogram of production and are principally powered using Nadec's renewable energy. Further, Pure Harvest can harvest waste heat from existing fossil fuel power plants and nearby infrastructure and use this energy to offset power demands in its climate systems while consuming CO2 (a fundamental ingredient for photosynthesis) to significantly increase its productivity. Due to the use of CO2 dosing, renewable energy integration, and the project's close proximity to the Riyadh metro market \u2013 resulting in transportation-related cost and CO2 emissions savings \u2013 this farm in the Kingdom is among the most innovative and sustainable farming projects in the world. As part of their partnership, Nadec and Pure Harvest will collaborate to support existing local farmers by developing sustainable solutions that they, too can use to improve yields, to reduce water consumption, and to boost production quality.","filter_flag":1}

As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional.
