Technology, including AI, is poised to automate time-consuming tasks, but investment in supply chain solutions is insufficient. In fact, recent research concludes that procurement departments are under-resourced and face several difficulties regarding funding, digital infrastructure and resource management. \u201cSenior procurement leaders understand that more-effective use of data is vital. Yet many procurement functions still struggle to transform themselves into data- and technology-driven organizations,\u201d according to business consultancy McKinsey. Three key problems are holding procurement initiatives back: issues with data quality and access, lack of clarity over the business case for new digital or AI applications, and difficulty driving adoption of the new tools at scale, McKinsey reported. It\u2019s notable that procurement, the heroes of the Covid-19 pandemic, are now somewhat stymied in regard to digitalization. Some corporations have moved at full speed to modernize their procurement departments while others, facing a challenging economic environment, are at best maintaining their supply chain investments. Seventy-five percent of organizations worldwide have increased or maintained their budgets for supply chain and procurement technology, according research from Jaggaer, a supplier of digital procurement solutions. However, many investments aren\u2019t going far enough. Nearly half (42 percent) of procurement teams state manual and inefficient processes slow them down and hold them back from fully addressing the C-suite\u2018s critical business priorities, such as navigating financial pressure. Gartner also found constraints are hobbling procurement departments, and supply chain leaders face barriers to addressing constrained resources. Many processes are still manual Procurement\u2019s biggest gripe? Non-value-added tasks still take up a lot of time. Twenty-five percent of procurement and supply chain teams report having some digitalization across procurement, but many core processes are still manual and inefficient, Jaggaer reported. One-third (33 percent) of sourcing professionals state their team collectively spends 11-20 hours per week creating and sending out invoices alone. Twenty-six percent spend 31-40 hours per week. Teams focused on supplier or category management spend 21-30 hours (34 percent) collectively on supplier communications each week. This includes everything from aligning on capabilities and sourcing needs to invoicing and payments. Only a small percentage of procurement teams are almost fully automated, which Jaggaer defines as teams being free to spend most of their time on strategic business initiatives. Only 9 percent of procurement professionals say their function today is completely autonomous, meaning they leverage automation and machine learning to drive predictive and prescriptive analytics, providing actionable insights and recommending optimum courses of action. At the same time, organizations are increasingly pushing procurement to the frontlines of navigating ongoing financial pressures. Despite the improved economic outlook, inflation, recession risk, and monetary policy changes continue to hit organizations hard. Half of procurement and finance professionals report that these factors are having a major or severe impact on their business. The view on AI It\u2019s clear that investment in technology is seen as the path toward more efficient procurement. Digital transformation is a top-three enterprise objective, according to Deloitte. In fact, 83 percent of IT teams that Jaggaer surveyed stated that their companies are aiming to modernize technology infrastructure in the broader business. Thirty-four percent of companies surveyed said emerging tech such as generative AI is already having a major impact on their business. Procurement professionals foresee generative AI adding value to their work for summarizing supplier performance (16 percent), identifying new suppliers (15 percent), and automating routine tasks like writing standard emails (12 percent). As organizations decide where and how to allocate the growing procurement and supply chain technology budgets, generative AI should be part of the conversation as it is incredibly powerful for helping procurement work both faster and smarter, Jaggaer advises. In addition to writing RFPs and creating POs, contract management is well-suited for AI, Jaggaer\u2019s Vice President of Direct Procurement Strategy Georg Roesch told EPSNews earlier this year. It can identify commonalities across multiple contracts and update those sections when necessary. This is particularly helpful when regulations affecting the contract, for example, change. Some professionals see contract negotiation aided by AI. Managing constraints Supply chain solutions are constantly being pressured by events such as terror attacks in the Red Sea or \u2014 in the case of electronics \u2014 slow demand and high levels of inventory. In a resource-constrained environment, Gartner recommends dealing with immediate crises versus the long term. In its research, Gartner found three main barriers preventing supply chain leaders from taking sufficient action to address internal constrained resources: Access to labor; fixed or limited capacity; and excessive energy costs. Procurement should focus on immediate threats to business viability, Gartner recommends, and shift strategies to: Motivate action by de-prioritizing long-term constraints and focus on addressing short-term risks that stakeholders are most focused on. Seek investment and shareholder buy-in on efforts that address the issues their organizations are already facing. Reprioritize long-term constraints to design solutions. Effective supply chain organizations can exert significant influence in product design that can impact considerations from material use to labor efficiency. Start with a focus on designing resource constraints out of new products, phasing in more sustainable and viable products for the future. Leverage the marketplace to learn and innovate. Leading supply chains innovate new solutions by creating opportunities to learn and leveraging their standing as customers. Companies should forge partnerships with innovators, startups and solution providers with a clear goal in mind. Experts reiterate that procurement departments should build clear businesses cases when seeking funding. Whether companies focus on technology or strategy, transformation requires vision, ambition, and sustained commitment from senior leadership, McKinsey concludes. It also depends upon teamwork and engagement. Jaggaer surveyed more than 220 business leaders worldwide to better understand the role of procurement and supply chain management. Gartner identified the top current resource constraints that threaten business viability via a survey of 143 supply chain leaders. by","filter_flag":1}

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us? You can\u2019t always count on Mother Nature to fix your dry, patchy lawn or wilted garden. Perhaps the easiest way to conserve and store water for a non-rainy day is with a rain barrel specifically designed for that very purpose. These reservoirs are placed underneath your gutter\u2019s downspout to collect runoff from your roof to use for irrigation and outdoor cleaning tasks, like washing down patio furniture or rinsing tools. Most rain barrels are made of all-weather plastic and have a spigot or a water hose connection, along with a screen at the collection point to prevent leaves and other debris from falling inside. They also come in multiple sizes, with 40 or 50 gallons offering plenty of capacity for the average homeowner. In terms of price, you can expect to pay $200 or less for a 50-gallon model. This buying guide covers expert tips to consider before purchasing a rain barrel, along with reviews of the best rain barrels we recommend. Following our reviews, we\u2019ve also included rain barrel FAQs and tips to help you maintain your rain barrel year-round. The Best Rain Barrels Best Overall: Best Value: Best for Gardens: What to Consider Capacity When selecting a rainwater collection barrel, assess your water needs and usage patterns. Consider the size of your garden, frequency of watering, and any other purposes for which you intend to use collected rainwater, such as cleaning or irrigation. This helps determine the appropriate barrel capacity to meet your requirements without overflow or frequent refilling. Also take into account the average rainfall in your area. A larger capacity barrel is advisable for regions with higher rainfall or prolonged dry spells between rain events, ensuring a sufficient supply during periods of scarcity. The size of your roof is another thing to factor in, particularly if you live in a wet climate. Larger capacity barrels may be heavier and more challenging to maneuver, requiring additional support structures and careful placement. Penny Crispin from the Snohomish Conservation District says sizes can vary drastically to fit individual needs. \u201cSome barrels are as small as 25 gallons, and others can hold over 100 gallons.\u201d On average, most people will do fine with 40 or 50 gallons of capacity. Materials Most rain barrels, including PVC, polyethylene, and polyethylene resin varieties, are crafted from high-density plastic. This material is favored for its resistance to rot and rust, lightweight nature, and affordability, making it the most popular choice for its ease of cleaning and transportation. However, remember that plastic may degrade when exposed to sunlight, potentially affecting longevity. Stone and clay rain barrels offer more than just aesthetic appeal; their natural properties make them ideal for rainwater collection. While they may capture smaller amounts of rainwater than other materials, their durability and insulation qualities ensure water stays cool and protected from sunlight, preventing algae growth. Their porous nature allows gradual water percolation into the soil, promoting better hydration for plants. Wooden barrels offer a rustic look and blend well with garden surroundings. However, wood requires regular maintenance to prevent rot and decay, making it less practical for long-term use without proper care. Features Depending on the intended use of the rain barrel, there may be features to look out for while shopping. Standard features for rain barrels include spigots or taps for easy access to water, overflow spouts, and screen filters that are placed over intake openings to precent debris, leaves, and insects from entering the barrel. Most rain barrels also have child safety locks and some offer linking systems to connect multiple barrels for more capacity. State and Local Restrictions Lastly, consider regulatory restrictions or incentives related to rainwater harvesting in your area. According to Crispin, rainwater collection is regulated in some states due to issues such as water rights, the reduction of downstream water, and natural infiltration when rainwater is harvested. On the other hand, some states encourage and even provide incentives for installing rain collection systems. Check with your state regulations and programs before you install rainwater collection. How We Selected In selecting the best rain barrels, we focused on key criteria to ensure functionality, sustainability, and practicality. We prioritized rain barrels made from high-quality, UV-resistant materials capable of withstanding various weather conditions and models with ample capacity and efficient water distribution features, such as integrated spigots and overflow outlets. We also considered budget, aesthetic preferences, and ease of maintenance. To substantiate our recommendations, we consulted with an expert in rainwater collection and conservation, Penny Crispin, the Community Conservation Department Manager for the Snohomish Conservation District in Snohomish County, Washington State.","filter_flag":1}

No need for a passenger manifest of gripes here; a brief summary would include illegally sacking 1700 ground crew during the pandemic and selling seats on non-existent \u201cghost flights\u201d.
