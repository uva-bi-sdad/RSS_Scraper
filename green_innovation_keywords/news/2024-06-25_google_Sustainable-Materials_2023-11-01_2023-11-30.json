That's according to a new survey by Specright , the leader in Specification Management software, with findings indicating that consumers today have a heightened awareness when it comes to sustainability and transparency from companies on their products and progress around sustainability goals. However, 69% of consumers don't believe companies today are accurately and honestly reporting on sustainability goals and metrics, and 40% are not comfortable purchasing products from companies that are not actively tracking toward sustainability goals. Amid this increased awareness, consumers are switching up their purchasing behaviors, with primary purchasers often putting their money toward more sustainable products. More than half (58%) of consumers indicated they are willing to spend more money on products that are deemed sustainable or environmentally friendly. Further, 74% of consumers indicated they are more likely to purchase from a company that is transparent about its sustainability practices (i.e., claiming carbon-neutrality, phasing out single-use plastics, using terms such as 'eco' or 'biodegradable,' etc.) and shares updates on progress toward sustainability goals frequently. Outside of making more sustainable purchasing decisions, consumers also have a desire to recycle and properly dispose of the products they buy but are putting the onus on companies and brands to tell them how to do so correctly. In fact, 82% of consumers say they are more likely to recycle products if companies and brands include the appropriate steps for how to recycle correctly directly on the product or packaging. This sentiment around sustainability can be expected to translate into 2024 purchasing decisions, as 71% of consumers revealed they plan to make more sustainable purchasing decisions next year. \"These results show consumers care about the sustainability of the products and packaging they purchase and the companies and brands they purchase from, and clearly companies have more work to do on this front,\" said Matthew Wright, founder and CEO of Specright. \"The results emphasize the importance of data and how it can influence a consumer's decision to purchase products, and many organizations today lack the data to back up their claims or even correctly track and report on sustainability goals, which can negatively impact business. As we move into 2024, it's imperative that companies organize and digitize critical product and packaging data to make reporting on sustainability as accurate as possible and even spark more sustainable product innovation.\" Additional survey findings revealed: Approximately 71% of consumers are more likely to believe a company's sustainability claims if they are printed directly on the product or packaging (i.e. similar to a nutritional label). More than half (53%) of consumers are willing to pay more money for a product with sustainable packaging versus a product with cheaper, non sustainable materials. While consumers are backing up their sustainability beliefs with their wallets, this can depend on certain factors like product or packaging material with consumers confirming they would pay more for: recycled cardboard (50%), cornstarch foam \/ water soluble packaging (48%), reusable plastic totes (62%), products with the terms like 'eco,' 'biodegradable' or 'recyclable' on packaging (55%), to name a few. More than two-thirds of consumers (67%) claim they don't know what the term greenwashing means. When it comes to holiday shopping this year, nearly two-thirds (62%) of consumers prefer to bundle items purchased from online retailers together and receive them at a later date as they believe it's more sustainable. Survey methodology: Specright surveyed 1,000 consumers above the age of 21 in the U.S. who indicated they are a primary purchaser in their household using the online insights platform Pollfish. This survey was completed in November 2023. \u200dAbout Specright Specright is the first purpose-built, patented platform for Specification Management.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Chemistry Society (J.A.C.S.), could provide a solution for the development of truly sustainable plastics. Commodity plastics have transformed global industry. Whether in construction, clothing, vehicles or food packaging, these plastics are everywhere in our daily lives, so much so that their global use has been estimated at around 460 million tons in 2019. This number is staggering, but not surprising, because plastics, also known as synthetic polymers, have met a large success thanks to their irreplaceable characteristics: they are light, cheap and incredibly versatile,\" explains Christophe Detrembleur, a chemist at the University of Li\u00e8ge. However, the fact that they are difficult to recycle, or even impossible to recycle in the case of thermosets, has serious consequences\". This impossibility of recycling not only leads to the depletion of the fossil resources used to manufacture them, but also to their very long-term accumulation in nature and the oceans. It is therefore imperative for our society to quickly design and manufacture plastics that can be easily recycled at the end of their life. In this context, a study led by researchers at the University of Li\u00e8ge and carried out in collaboration with the University of Mons and the University of the Basque Country, reports on a new technique for producing easily recyclable polyurethane plastics. The special feature of this approach is the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) - a major emblematic waste of our society - as a raw material for the production of the building blocks, or monomers, needed to manufacture these new products,\" explains Thomas Habets, PhD student at ULi\u00e8ge and first author of the article. The structure of the monomers can be easily modified, making it possible to produce plastics with a wide range of properties, from highly malleable elastomers such as silicones to more rigid materials such as polystyrene\". These plastics have a chemical structure that resembles a three-dimensional network rather than long linear chains. This structure, which is generally associated with thermosets that are very difficult to recycle, makes them more resistant than plastics made from long molecular chains. The polyurethanes created here have new 'dynamic' chemical bonds, which means that despite their thermoset structure, they can be reshaped by exchanges of chemical bonds under relatively mild reaction conditions. The greatest advantage of this new technology lies in its ability to vary the range of properties accessible while offering multiple ways of recycling materials at their end-of-life. \" These new plastics can be recycled in multiple ways, either by simply reshaping them by heating them, or by mixing different types of plastic to create hybrid materials with new properties, or by breaking them down into their constituent monomers, which is ideal for eliminating additives such as dyes or recycling composites,\" continues Thomas Habets. With a view to the future industrialization of CO 2 valorization, this study demonstrates that waste CO 2 can be directly used as a chemical resource. \"This is the first initial study using our new building blocks and plastics,\" enthuses Christophe Detrembleur, \"but it is quite remarkable to see that our materials can already reach properties similar to those of some conventional petro-sourced plastics.\u201d This new technology is emerging as a potential solution for the development of sustainable plastics with a wide range of properties that can easily meet the needs of most of our everyday applications.","filter_flag":1}

Soisa Aircraft Interiors, for instance, confides that it is actively exploring innovative ways to use sustainable materials such as those derived from pecan and corn shells or peel. \u201cThese natural materials are abundant and exhibit remarkable strength when combined with other substances. They have the potential to be transformed into various key components such as shrouds and tray tables,\u201d says Jacobo Mesta, CEO of Soisa, a fast-growing company that specialises in seat covers, cushions, composite panels, upholstery, and seat assembly services. Indeed biodegradable pecan shells, which can give a woody look to the finished product and is used elsewhere for resins \u201ccan be effectively transformed into a plastic-like material\u201d, notes Mesta. \u201cThis innovation holds the potential to be utilized in the aerospace industry, particularly in interior products.\u201d \u201cThe challenge,\u201d he adds, \u201clies in obtaining approval for these products for use, which presents clear difficulties due to stringent regulations, but we are committed to persevering in our efforts.\u201d Indeed, obtaining FAA and EASA certification for new products continues to remain a major challenge due in part to industry\u2019s understandably exacting flammability certification requirements. Individuals with nut allergies might also bristle at the notion of using pecan shells in interiors. Ensuring that no pecan protein is found in the final result may be key. In addition to its investigation into the use of bio-based composite materials as part of industry\u2019s decarbonisation efforts, Soisa continues to explore opportunities for recycling various aircraft interiors. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that when it comes to existing materials already within the aircraft and our specific line of business, we have not yet identified a product that can be reintegrated into the aircraft,\u201d reveals Mesta. \u201cWhile our sustainability efforts are making strides in some areas, there are still challenges associated with repurposing certain materials within our industry.\u201d Indeed, to his latter point, whilst some major thermoplastic providers, including SIMONA Boltaron, have cracked the code to achieve true recycling of aerospace-rated sheets for aircraft interiors \u2014 in instances where aesthetic perfection is not required \u2014 the material is from recycled scrap and not from thermoplastics that have already been used in aircraft interiors. Elsewhere, however, Soisa has been demonstrating its environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials by embracing a creative \u2018Waste to Wonder\u2019 upcycling programme that sees the Chihuahua, Mexico-headquartered firm work with an artisans\u2019 cooperative from the local Tarahumara people, providing seat covers, curtains and other material from aircraft. In turn, the artisans transform what would have been waste material into handmade handicrafts: wallets, bags, tablet cases, pouches, bottle carriers, and much more. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the significant success we\u2019ve achieved across our Waste to Wonder project. Through the campaign, we reuse excess and waste materials that would otherwise end up in landfills and use this to teach the local Tarahumara tribe how to cut and sew for products they can use or sell. We are continuously looking at ways we can expand the project,\u201d says Mesta. Outside of industry\u2019s sustainability efforts, Soisa observes that airlines largely remain conservative in their interior design choices. \u201cIn terms of design, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of \u2018risk-taking\u2019 in recent years,\u201d says Mesta. \u201cPopular themes primarily revolve around common shapes, colors, and materials. To demonstrate this point, we\u2019ve invested in a CNC stitching machine that can accommodate intricate and unique designs, but we haven\u2019t had many opportunities to fully utilise it. Despite this, we still manage to sew a wide range of designs manually with our skilled workforce. While there have been instances of unusual colors like yellow, orange, and red, differences from traditional colors aren\u2019t very common.\u201d Regarding the promise of 3D-printed interiors, progress has been relatively slow, particularly in the commercial sector, he admits. \u201cThis is often due to the high volumes needed to justify the significant investment required. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve found a practical workaround by creating a 3D printing model and subsequently transitioning the same design into an injection moulding process. This approach maintains the design but can also offer a faster return on investment, making it an attractive option in certain cases.\u201d Related Articles: Featured image credited to Soisa Aircraft Interiors","filter_flag":1}

GenZ can see through greenwashing quickly and expects companies to treat them as equals. Brands that really contribute to society and environment will make a deep connection to the next generation. What factors matter when trying to make sustainable choices? Designers need to think about environmental and social responsibility in terms of raw materials, production, transportation, product use, disposal and recycling. This will lead to the adoption of new business models that measure success in new ways. Should the industry improve how sustainability is talked about? A lot of the terminology has no standard definition \u2013 but I\u2019m happy to share my understanding. \u2018Eco-design\u2019 considers environmental factors in design, while \u2018sustainable design\u2019 also includes social aspects. \u2018Circular design\u2019 aims to reduce waste and enhance resource efficiency, often utilising strategies like \u2018product as a service\u2019 and emphasising reparability and maintenance. \u2018Regenerative design\u2019 goes further, considering cultural and societal factors, actively contributing to the regeneration of eco-systems and communities. Words like \u2018sustainability\u2019 and \u2018innovation\u2019 have become vague buzzwords. At Designworks, we address sustainability in very specific terms at the start of every project. Together with our partners, we define the purpose of the project, formulate measurable goals and reflect on the questions we want to answer. We call this \u2018design for intention\u2019. How can companies best integrate sustainability into their culture? Firstly, by embracing that profitability and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. New key performance indicators (KPIs) are evolving to reflect this synergy. Secondly, it\u2019s not enough to make sustainability an agenda item. Integrating external partners and nurturing cross-functional teams enhances the potential for fresh perspectives in future-proofed solutions. It\u2019s equally vital to embed these changes in underlying structures. Thirdly, accept that change is positive! We\u2019re transitioning from an industrial to a knowledge society, where creativity is pivotal for progress. Leveraging designers\u2019 intuition and their expertise in utilising complexity, even within the realm of business strategy, is crucial for driving the transformation towards a future we all want to live in. Jay Beever, VP, Embraer Design Operations How have your design ideas progressed since the Praeterra concept? We\u2019ve introduced sustainable recycled and upcycled materials into our new product development pipeline, so down the line we could have sustainability collections that people can pull from. For example, we\u2019re looking at 3D-printing titanium for interior trim components, using leftover material from the production process in Brazil. I have sample parts in my office of our Phenom cupholder area, 3D-printed in titanium with a beautiful bead-blasted satin finish. It\u2019s not plated, it\u2019s made from scrap titanium dust. Praeterra had the Mokume-gane, made from folded-up metals, created into a billet. It didn\u2019t need to be plated, because the grain work was the beauty. What new innovations have caught your eye? For instance, at EBACE I met with Paolo Foglizzo of Foglizzo Leather, which takes scrap leather, mixes it into a fibre mush, and creates a new leather sheet material, a composite with 15% polyester. I looked at it, smelled it; it\u2019s leather. I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with it. There\u2019s limitations on colour right now, but that\u2019ll expand. Suppliers are also sourcing hides from farms that raise cattle for food, which would otherwise be thrown away. And they can pick cattle that have been fed seaweed. Including seaweed in feed reduces a cow\u2019s methane output dramatically. There\u2019s a long chain of detail that goes into a material\u2019s carbon footprint. Natalie Rodr\u00edguez, principal, Natalie Rodr\u00edguez Luxury Design Is sustainable design of growing interest to clients? There\u2019s definitely been an increase in demand over the last few years. On a recent project the client took great interest in the undyed\/natural heather dye carpets Kalogridis unveiled at NBAA-BACE 2022. This customer also didn\u2019t want to use materials with PFA substances \u2013 synthetic chemicals resistant to heat, grease, oil and water, and also resistant to degradation in the environment. We double checked with suppliers that PFAs weren\u2019t used in the production of their materials or FR treatments. What factors matter when trying to make sustainable choices? My favourite factors to consider are positive environmental impact as well as anything that isn\u2019t artificial, but rather, naturally sourced. Customers are also a driving factor \u2013 some requests might include all natural, plant-based materials, without any plastics or animal by-products, while some request to have seat leather, but to make sure everything is sustainably sourced and produced responsibly. What are the challenges to overcome to make more progress? There might be more hesitation to incorporate new ideas and products that are sustainable simply because they haven\u2019t been used many times before. There might be questions regarding how long certain materials will hold up over time, and how colours from naturally sourced products really turn out in production since there is less control in colour variances or lack of a dye lot. What other solutions would you like to see developed by suppliers? I\u2019m loving the direction suppliers are currently moving in \u2013 utilising resources found in our natural environment through new plant-based and recyclable materials, as well as natural dyes for colour. It would be wonderful to see more suppliers come out with their own sustainability lines to provide a variety of options. There are many beautiful sustainable materials that have been developed in other industries that would be great to use in aviation applications. It would be wonderful for suppliers to invest in having any new and innovative materials tested for applicable burn and\/or sliding friction and have the information readily available on the label and their website catalogue. This way aviation interior designers can select their materials with the utmost assurance. This would especially be applicable to suppliers looking to break into aviation, as those that are already in the industry are more likely to test\/certify anything new prior to offering these to designers. Tray Crow, director, interior design, Gulfstream Is sustainable design of growing interest to clients? Yes \u2013 certainly more so now than perhaps 10 years ago. It\u2019s part of how we operate. The new galley on the G700 has a dual-zone trash compartment for example. That\u2019s something we added so that flight attendants can separate recyclables to waste. Even in building aircraft, it\u2019s always been about efficiency, and how we provide more for less. What are some of your sustainability efforts when it comes to materials? With our seat leather, all our patterns for the seats are digitised now. Everything\u2019s cut on a Gerber cutter so we maximise the use of every hide. Specifying leather on high-wear surfaces is important because it\u2019s a durable material \u2013 it lasts five times longer than most soft goods. Leather is a by-product of the meat industry and we\u2019re diverting that from landfill. Any waste that we do have is donated either to charities or schools. Some of our waste leather has been turned into soccer balls for schools and communities in need. Everything that goes into our carpet is natural, down to the latex backing and the jute structure that provides the canvas. The tufting is either silk or wool, both rapidly renewable resources. One of our suppliers carries the Greenguard certification, so that\u2019s available to our customers as well. About 40% of the veneer we specify is composite veneer that comes from rapidly renewable resources. Veneer maximises yield anyway, because it consists of thin sheets applied to a substrate. We also focus on lightweight elements such as honeycomb materials. How would you like to see the wider industry respond? Innovation is a shared responsibility for the whole industry. With our suppliers, how they\u2019re bringing new products to market, and working on sustainability within their own processes \u2013 bringing that to the forefront is important. Judy Miller, allied ASID, Judy Miller Interior Design Is sustainable design of growing interest to clients? Wellness continues to be of interest to clients and the A&D industry, driving vendors to go green. Should the industry improve how sustainability information is presented? OEMs would benefit by being more transparent with their sustainable initiatives and practices in their advertising. They could promote how they benefit customer wellness and are lowering their environmental impact. Sustainable alternative fuel efforts are great, but there\u2019s so much about interiors that could be shared as well. Are there any sustainability-focused ideas that have caught your eye recently? I\u2019ve been very impressed with soft goods suppliers moving more and more into sustainable products. Tapis is a standout. How else might the industry make progress? I\u2019d like to see OEMs and refurbishment centres using more sustainable\/green substrates, foams and adhesives, as well as water-based paints for interior and exterior paint applications. I\u2019d also like to see materials recycled whenever possible when removed from aircraft interiors, especially in refurbishments, much like how clients are recycling kitchen appliances, and donating kitchen cabinets and furniture to places such as Habitat for Humanity ReStore. Sylvain Mariat, head of creative design and concepts, Airbus Corporate Jets Was sustainability a design factor for the first ACJ TwoTwenty completion? Yes certainly; at the beginning of the project, we agreed that most of the material suppliers would be located not far away from Comlux\u2019s completion facility in Indianapolis, USA, to minimise carbon footprint. We have also focused on the origin of the wood veneer used for the interior fittings and we decided to use wood with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label. In what other ways have you addressed sustainability? It\u2019s not new for us to address sustainability with materials. For example, we work with a French partner on a solvent-free paint that we propose to our customers. We can also talk about leather. We recommend vegetable tanning to our customers instead of chemical tanning. For carpets we use wool and silk \u2013 natural materials rather than synthetic materials. Beyond the materials used, we encourage our suppliers to propose cabin designs with optimised weight, mainly through design conception or the use of innovative lightweight composite. How do you design a cabin to have a long life? A sustainable cabin means also designing to avoid having to replace large parts to perform small repairs. For example, we make partitions from a combination of parts so that if there is a scratch, we only need to remove and repair one small part. I also like using paint on cabinetry because it can contribute to saving weight; it is easier to maintain; and to extend the component\u2019s life. How important is recyclability? Our approach to environmental responsibility doesn\u2019t end at the design stage. During manufacturing, after delivery and even at the end of an aircraft\u2019s service life, we continue to search for ways to reduce the environmental footprint of our aircraft. Airbus and Tarmac Aerosave have established a proven method for decommissioning, dismantling and recycling the entire Airbus aircraft product range in an environmentally responsible way. We are able to recycle more than 90% of an aircraft. Mindy Huang, sales engineering, Bombardier Is there a lot of interest in sustainability from clients? A lot. Sustainability is a huge movement. A lot of clients think it important to reduce their footprint, so we have a whole catalogue of options and take a scientific approach to studying CO 2 impact and water scarcity. An example is Eucalyptus veneer. Eucalyptus grows very fast and doesn\u2019t need to be uprooted to harvest; you can cut it at the trunk and it\u2019ll regrow. It\u2019s a very sustainable material. What is the aim with your environmental product declarations (EPDs)? We have a sustainability team that produces the EPDs. That studies every single part that goes on an aircraft, so we\u2019re very transparent about the impact of the product\u2019s lifecycle on the environment. The scientific assessment that underpins the EPD helps Bombardier to optimise the design of its products according to sustainable criteria. Is there anything else you wanted to share? Bombardier\u2019s ESG plan includes a commitment to invest over 50% of our R&D towards greener aircraft by 2025.

Why shop at zero waste shops anyway? Yes, litter looks unsightly, but is buying your essentials sealed in a protective layer of plastic so bad? The short answer is (unsurprisingly) yes. Roughly eight million pieces of plastic enter our oceans daily, and we currently have between 82\u2013358 trillion microplastics on the planet. These tiny plastic waste pieces were estimated to weigh 1.1\u20134.9 million tonnes in 2019. The even worse news is that this plastic isn\u2019t going anywhere. A plastic bottle can last up to 500 years in the marine environment and gradually fragment into smaller pieces over time. Almost all plastic produced since 1950 is still sitting in our planet\u2019s landfills. Wildlife, including fish, dolphins, and seabirds, mistake the plastic for food and ingest it with deadly consequences. Plastic packaging can also get entangled around the creatures, trapping them and preventing them from breathing or moving. It\u2019s not only animal welfare we should be concerned about, either. Roughly one in three fish caught for human consumption now contain plastic, meaning we\u2019re eating it too. Plastic in seawater absorbs chemicals such as PCBs and DDTs, substances linked to endocrine disruption and even some cancers. These chemicals become more powerful as they go up the food chain. With all those mind-blowing and frightening statistics, going low or zero waste is a no-brainer. Switching to reusable packaging helps conserve resources and minimize waste and pollution. With around 42% of GHG emissions caused by the production and use of goods, reducing packaging and choosing sustainable products is crucial. By transporting our essentials in paper sacks, glass mason jars and bottles, jute bags, and biodegradable materials, we avoid the unnecessary extraction of raw materials for packaging. The zero waste lifestyle goes far beyond saying \u2018bye\u2019 to plastic. It\u2019s a vital component of the circular economy, encouraging people to reuse, repair and repurpose things rather than buy new ones. Many zero waste goods are designed to last much longer than their plastic-ridden, unsustainable counterparts. Though they might sometimes come with a higher price point initially, you\u2019ll save money by replacing items less often in the long run. Zero waste grocery shopping is also great for tackling food waste. Roughly 22% of all municipal solid waste in the US is food, making it the most significant contributor to US landfills. By buying only what you\u2019ll need and use, you avoid throwing away unwanted or spoiled produce. Community-based zero waste strategies benefit everyone and everything. No-packaging stores (online or in person) create jobs, improve the economy, encourage people to work together, and reduce our impacts. Less plastic trash in the ground, more usable space, and reduced chance of toxins in the atmosphere make for a healthy and happier planet.","filter_flag":1}

Antolin, the global provider of technological solutions for car interiors, has developed a pioneering project that employs mycelium-based natural materials to help reduce the environmental impact of vehicle components. Mycelium is the vegetative part of fungi, so it is found naturally in terrestrial ecosystems. Thanks to an innovative process, mycelium binds with vegetable residues to develop a structural material with which to produce automotive components. In addition, this form of sustainable production is carbon neutral, as the material development occurs organically directly in the mould, compared to the traditional plastic injection process. The project increases the efficiency of the circular economy and is the natural response to reduce the use of plastic in automotive parts. With this innovation, Antolin contributes to decarbonisation and leverages the infinite resources nature provides, setting a precedent for the automotive industry and helping it be implemented in other sectors. This project also shows how to advance the research of materials and new processes for the automotive industry, with minimal impact on carbon footprints, through the use of 100% biodegradable products at the end of their life cycle, compared to non-biodegradable products that can end up in oceans and rivers. In addition, it gives a second life to waste of natural origin that can be implemented in an industrial setting. By researching these types of solutions, Antolin wants to offer its customers innovative, high-impact proposals, helping them introduce fully sustainable materials, structures and processes into their future vehicle programmes to meet decarbonisation goals across the automotive value chain.","filter_flag":1}
