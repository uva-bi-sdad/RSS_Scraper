The switch took place late last year. Recycling carts rolled into Bay City with help from an EGLE infrastructure grant and The Recycling Partnership. Grants from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), trade association American Beverage\u2019s Every Bottle Back initiative, and the nonprofit Recycling Partnership covered the cost of the carts plus education and outreach about the city\u2019s new every-other-week recycling collection schedule that started Jan. 2. The city is the first Great Lakes Bay Region community partnering with the state to provide the carts. At a kickoff event, Bay City Parks and Environmental Affairs Manager Tim Botzau said the change is expected to more than double Bay City\u2019s pickup of recyclable materials, from 160 pounds a year per household to an estimated 350 pounds a year. The estimated 1,425 additional tons collected will bring the community total closer to 2,626 tons a year, an all-time high. EGLE Recycling Specialist Tracy Purrenhage said curbside carts are a high-priority way to increase collection of materials that can be reused and repurposed into new products and to keep recyclable materials from going into landfills. Michigan\u2019s MI Healthy Climate Plan for economywide carbon neutrality by 2050 includes a goal of tripling Michigan\u2019s recycling rate to 45% from 2005-2030. \u201cOur goal is to make it easier than ever before for Bay City residents \u2013 and others who live in the Great Lakes Bay Region and across Michigan \u2013 to reduce, reuse and recycle items instead of throwing them away in the garbage,\u201d Purrenhage said. The new curbside pickup service will use trucks equipped with mechanical arms to pick up and empty carts. Bay City residents can find collection scheduled information and answers to frequently asked questions at BayCityRecycles.org. Officials ask that residents continue to do their part by placing only recyclable materials in the recycling carts, including glass bottles and jars, aluminum and steel cans, food and beverage cartons, paper products (including newspapers and flattened cardboard), and empty plastic bottles and containers. Food and drink containers should be rinsed. Items that cannot be recycled include plastic bags, paper towels, electrical equipment, batteries, and clothing. Find more recycling do\u2019s and don\u2019ts on EGLE\u2019s recycling information website, RecyclingRaccoons.org.","filter_flag":1}

Sales of household cleaning products surged during the pandemic, but what does demand for these brands look like in a post-Covid world? While annual sales growth has slowed to 3-4% (from a peak of 15% during the pandemic), companies in this space are appealing to customers by putting the \u201cclean\u201d back in cleaning, according to executives at the Inspired Home Show in Chicago this week. In a market where licensed mops, sponges, cleaning gloves, and other products account for a large share of the business, many companies are promoting natural and green cleaners stripped of harmful chemicals and featuring recyclable packaging. And in a category where price has traditionally been king, consumers are showing a willingness to pay more for natural and organic products that benefit the environment. Overall, global sales of household cleaning products are expected to increase 4.4% annually to $334.1 billion in 2029. \u201cWe really have to make sure we are on the cutting edge [of ingredients and product design] because consumers\u2019 perception of what disinfectant and antimicrobial means has changed,\u201d said Danielle Caltabiano, VP of Omnichannel Sales and Marketing at Ginsey Home Solutions. Ginsey sells products under the licensed Clorox (antimicrobial plastic toilet seats, bath mats) and Arm & Hammer (odor eliminator) brands and is readying Clorox-branded kitchen cleaning products for launch in early 2024, Caltabiano said. And Bradshaw is using more recyclable materials in packaging as well as readying a new design of the Mr. Clean character for later this year. The redesign will replace the image of Mr. Clean with his arms folded across his chest with, in the case of gloves, one hand reaching out from the packaging. And while clean ingredients and sustainable packaging are important to many consumers, factors like availability and price can outweigh those concerns for other customers. \u201cCleaning product preferences differ from person to person and can be influenced by psychographic, demographic, and behavioral factors, which are impacted by lifestyle standards and awareness,\u201d according to a Fortune Business Insights report. \u201cConsumer loyalty and product distinctiveness are difficult to maintain in today\u2019s market for household cleaning products. Consumers are frequently driven to innovative items so are unable to remain loyal to a single product or brand. Small and medium-size manufacturers are challenged to keep up with trends due to changing consumer preferences. As a result, these issues together limit market expansion.\u201d Other efforts to expand the cleaning supplies market, such as outbound licensing, are also an area of focus moving forward. This is especially true for rapidly growing cleaning brands like Scrub Daddy. The company is launching new products (mops and all-purpose cleaning creams) under its own brand to extend beyond its top-selling scrubbing sponges, said Jennifer Orr Picariello, VP of Sales and Marketing at Scrub Daddy. Additionally, Scrub earlier this year signed an agreement to develop co-branded product with Unilever\u2019s Cif household cleaning products. \u201cIt is all about mindshare and, if it\u2019s about commodity, people are going to buy the cheapest thing. But if you win mindshare and inspire consumers, they will love your brand,\u201d said Joseph Derochowski, VP and Advisor for Home and Home Improvement industries at The NPD Group.","filter_flag":1}

Notably, the business explained to Confectionery Production that it will be placing a strong emphasis on delivering complete systems that have a high degree of focus on sustainable operation. The company will be at Hall 14, Booth C22 for the major global event taking place between May 4-10, alongside sister company Hastamat, the Franconian packaging machine manufacturer showcasing its own extensive portfolio. With its bar line and its combined line, LoeschPack is presenting several integrated packaging solutions to the trade audience at once: from primary packaging to the sales tray. The spotlight will be on new pack styles that use sustainable and recyclable materials. \u201cWe want to help our customers pack their products faster, more sustainably, and more efficiently,\u201d says Olaf Piepenbrock, Managing Partner of LoeschPack, Hastamat, and parent company Piepenbrock. \u201cWe achieve this with our new, high-performance packaging lines, their ease of handling, and our packaging process, which is perfectly tailored to the product. This is our way of continuing to live up to our corporate promise of \u2018Packaging your ideas\u2026\u2019 to a global audience.\u201d The packaging machine manufacturer has completely rethought the principle of horizontal flow wrap packaging \u2013 and developed a modular packaging line: from the buffer via the feeder, the bar packed in the flow pack arrives ready for the sales tray. And all the production steps are carried out from a single source. For this completely new development, LoeschPack focused on a hygienic design, simple operation, and a small footprint. All machines are equipped with the new \u201ceasyMI\u201d HMI (Human- Machine Interface) with an 18.5-inch touchscreen. As the company noted, clear, simple visualisations and shortcuts ensure that users are fully supported at all times. Machine operators and maintenance personnel can now operate the machines more easily and access a wide range of control and performance components. They are also assisted by a new mobile service app that makes it much easier to contact our service specialists through a secure connection should the need ever arise. It\u2019s an attractive overall package \u2013 and equipped with everything needed for flexible and efficient production. Whether for a multilevel or gondola buffer system, the LOOP buffer system is specially designed to meet the requirements of large-scale production for bars and other confectionery products. With integrated storage systems, LoeschPack is succeeding in increasing efficiency and regulating production flow. The system is directly linked to the latest- generation LOMATIC, a feeding and distribution system designed for all speed ranges. In addition to chocolate, the machine also processes cookies, wafers, and granola bars. Row by row, the LOMATIC feeds the downstream packaging machines \u2013 at a speed of up to 160 rows per minute. From Napolitains to 300-gram bars. The design is optimised for running accuracy, a long service life, easy cleaning, and simple and fast size changeovers. Flow wrapping developments The fully revised CMT packs the incoming bars from the FHW-S horizontal flow wrapping machine in cardboard. The highly flexible top loading cartoning system from the LoeschPack C-series is space-saving and suitable for secondary packaging of a wide variety of pre-packed products for the confectionery, food, and non-food sectors. The particularly powerful application straightens up the flat carton blanks and both fills and seals them. Considering the speed performance, the required space and footprint of the toploader are very small. The CMT can handle an infeed of up to 1,000 products per minute at its maximum speed \u2013 with a maximum output of up to 200 cartons. The incoming products from the flow wrapping machine are turned 90 degrees with a simple turning device, decelerated, and fed to the racetrack. And it is not just size changeovers that are easy: the machine is also easily accessible to operators for cleaning and maintenance work. The cable routing within the base frame ensures an uncluttered design. No matter whether the customer needs a high-speed inline variant, a traditional 90- degree infeed, or dual-lane infeed, the CMT is available in versions that reflect these requirements. This rounds off LoeschPack\u2019s product range in the field of cartoning. LTM-Duo With the LTM-DUO combined line, LoeschPack is presenting the trade audience its integrated, flexible, and fully comprehensive system solution for packaging chocolate bars. The successful LTM-DUO model combines perfect packaging and machines with a high degree of automation, low personnel requirements, and a small footprint. The flexible LTM-DUO fold wrapping machine packs more than 200 chocolate bars per minute in a tightly sealed primary wrap. The outer wrap of the chocolate bar can be a paper label from a stack or reel, or it can be a cardboard label. The machine is joined by the CMW cartoning module. The machine fills 30 display cartons per minute \u2013 for perfect product presentation on the supermarket shelf. An integrated buffer between the primary packaging and cartoning stages prevents product rejects in the event of downtime. Only one hot glue device and a controller with the new HMI are required for the entire line. This has a positive effect on procurement costs and parts procurement. In addition, the complete system can be operated by a single person who can keep an eye on operating conditions at all times. The system\u2019s compact design takes up significantly less space than comparable layouts. This makes the combined line significantly more cost-effective than a configuration with two stand-alone machines. The CMW cartoning module can be flexibly combined \u2013 and is also available as a stand-alone version. This means, for example, that it can be operated in a layout with two upstream fold wrapping or flow wrapping machines. In the future, an upgrade kit will also be available, allowing an older LTM-DUO to be easily combined with the new system. Related content","filter_flag":1}
