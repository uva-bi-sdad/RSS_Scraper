As founder of Protect Our Winters, a nonprofit that focuses on legislative climate action, and Jones Snowboards, maker of boards, gear, and apparel, it\u2019s his job. Jones also happens to be my cousin, and we\u2019ve talked about environmentalism and sustainability our entire adult lives. But how does he translate those thoughts into actual, tangible, everyday deeds? I recently spoke to Jones about how he takes action for climate 365 days a year. Constant Communication Everyday actions and practices matter, but conversations, especially with people who might be in a different political camp as you, are key. A lot of people feel like they don\u2019t belong to the climate movement because they recognize they contribute to the problem\u2013maybe they fly a lot, raise cattle, or just love burgers, work for an oil or plastics company, or still buy bottled water by the case. This feeling of being on the outside is a huge problem. I don\u2019t care what you do, we need you to join the climate movement. We need people from all sectors, political parties, regions, and backgrounds working together on this one unifying thing: the planet we all live on. Because climate change impacts all of us. When I talk to people about climate change, I try to find common ground. Your political leanings don\u2019t matter: if you love skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, hunting, or fishing, this affects you. If you love to go mountain biking, RVing, waterskiing, or camping with your kids, it affects you, too. Everyone needs to be welcome in this movement. Whether you drive a monster truck or a Tesla, we want you to be part of the conversation and the solution. \u201cMake your voice heard,\u201d says Jones, who regularly lobbies in Washington, reaches out to lawmakers, and participates in climate rallies. (Photo: Ming Poon) A Greener Business We launched Jones Snowboards in 2010, and from the start we identified a three point North star: performance, durability, and sustainability. Being part of 1% For The Planet is key because we need more people that wake up every day working on climate action and our donation helps with that. Three years ago we took a big step by moving away from toxic traditional epoxy resins (to hold the board components together). We finally found a bio-based resin (made from tree sap) that works every bit as good as the old stuff. It took a lot of trial and error. Next winter we\u2019ll take another big step, with a project that\u2019s been six years in the making: turning old snowboards into new products, and keeping them out of the landfill. We developed a machine that pops the metal edges and inserts off old boards (for recycling). Then we stack boards on top of each other, press them together, and cut them into strips to create these really strong structural pieces we\u2019ll use (instead of carbon fiber) to support power spots in new boards. Plant-Based Diet I hate dietary titles, but I\u2019ve been embracing a vegan diet for over 10 years. I used to love a good burger, but I\u2019ve lost the taste for it and this is the best lifestyle lever I can pull for the climate. The cattle industry accounts for 14.5 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions [according to the UN]. As a country, we eat way too much red meat. My plant-based diet has also made me a better athlete. I feel better at 48 than I did at 28. Years ago, I thought my snowboard career was waning, but when I switched to a plant-based diet, I felt way more spry and way less achy. I noticed less inflammation in my muscles and joints. Voting With Dollars Change takes longer than you think it will, but once it starts, it happens faster than you thought it could. Here\u2019s an example, going back to the food idea: I was coming back from a snowboarding trip recently. It was late and we were driving through Bakersfield, California, (north of L.A) and we were starving. We found a random burger shack that was open and as we pulled in, I thought, \u2018what am I gonna eat here.\u2019 Turns out that place had awesome plant-based burgers and shakes. Even Burger King and MacDonald\u2019s have plant-based options on the menus now. You would never have seen that a few years back. But people demanded it, and are voting for plant-based food with their dollars. And it\u2019s changing. The same applies to the outdoor industry. Consumers are rewarding companies for making cleaner products and using their power to get us on a better path. Reducing Emissions We only have so much CO2 to burn and I think about my carbon emissions every day. I switched to an EV a couple years ago. I carpool to the mountain and the trailhead and ride my bike around town rather than drive. I recycle and avoid plastic. I\u2019ve updated my house with solar panels, a heat pump, better insulation, more efficient appliances, all of which gave me huge energy savings. And I only get on a plane when I really have to. I take fewer, longer, slower trips now. The majority of my adventuring takes place here in the Sierra, my back yard, and I\u2019ve cut my air travel by about 90 percent over the last 15 years.. It stung a bit at first losing my frequent flier benefits, but I\u2019m over it and now I\u2019m happy sitting in the back of the plane and traveling less. Pro tip for others who have recently lost airline status: Board last and ask if they can bump you up to a better seat or an empty row (poor man\u2019s first class). Doing right by the planet can make you happier, healthier, and\u2014yes\u2014wealthier. Outside\u2019s Head of Sustainability, Kristin Hostetter, explores small lifestyle tweaks that can make a big impact. Write to her at climateneutral-ish@outsideinc.com.","filter_flag":1}

The report, titled Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: A Guide to Corporate Climate Action, notes that a revenue opportunity of USD$4.3 trillion is available for Asian businesses by 2030 from activities like the expansion of renewable power, energy efficiency in buildings, and greater circularity in producing industries, making up a 43% share of the global total. Similarly, 58% of the jobs required to service those opportunities will be situated in Asia, creating as many as 232 million roles for the region. \u201cAsia is key on the journey towards net zero,\u201d said Gim Huay Neo, Managing Director, Centre for Nature and Climate, World Economic Forum. \u201cAsia accounts for 51% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. More than half of annual emissions are from industries like electricity, manufacturing, and land use. Business has a strong role in cutting emissions and climate action. To scale, accelerate, and sustain efforts, business needs to collaborate with government and communities, harness innovation, and build partnerships across their value chains.\u201d The whitepaper makes clear the impact of inaction on Asia. Beyond the widespread environmental and individual impact, the report notes extreme climate change is expected to drastically affect Asian economies. Based on a severe increase of 3.2\u00b0C by 2050, Asia is projected to see a reduction in GDP by over 26%. Southeast Asia is predicted to experience a GDP reduction of 37%\u2014by far the worst around the globe. \u201cThe business case for climate action is clear,\u201d said Paul Marriott, APJ President at SAP. \u201cWe know that 50% of Asian businesses believe addressing environmental issues will be material to business results within the next five years. Organizations who ignore or hedge their climate strategies gamble their ethics, revenues, and competitive advantage.\u201d \u201cUnmitigated climate change is the biggest threat of our generation. The world economy could lose more than 18% of current GDP if no action on climate change is taken. And the impact would be significantly higher in Asia, at almost 26%,\u201d said Neeraj Aggarwal, Chair, BCG Asia-Pacific. \u201cAt the same time, Asia is at a pivotal juncture in its history, where beyond its vulnerability, it also represents the biggest economic opportunity for global climate action. The time is right for Asian leaders to make bold strides for the good of their businesses, and the world.\u201d The preliminary findings of Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: A Guide to Corporate Climate Action were discussed during a session at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos-Klosters earlier this year. \u201cThe Net-Zero challenge requires urgent public-private co-operation on a global scale. The Forum engages and builds multi-stakeholder platforms to scale and accelerate the climate and nature agenda,\u201d said Gim Huay Neo. \u201cOnly through fostering trust and collaboration can we safeguard our global commons and secure a net zero, nature positive and better living future for all of us and generations to come.\u201d More information and the full Accelerating Asia\u2019s Advantage: Your Guide to Corporate Climate Action report is available here.

It focused on actions to address major obstacles to the advancement of agrifood systems transformation for healthy diets. Urgent need to address climate change and nutrition nexus The production of today's diets is putting significant strain on agrifood systems, compromising the stability and resilience of natural resources and biodiverse ecosystems, and contributing to climate change. Among the suggested actions to effectively address climate change and reduce agrifood systems\u2019 environmental footprint, a shift towards healthy diets is considered central. In response, the Government of Egypt, as President of COP27, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), FAO, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and other partners, launched the Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN), which aims to create a strong alliance between the nutrition and climate communities to implement policy actions that simultaneously improve nutrition outcomes and support climate change mitigation and adaptation. Building on the I-CAN, the seventh FAO in Geneva Nutrition dialogue featured country experiences from Malawi, Pakistan and Ethiopia highlighting practical examples across agrifood systems that can simultaneously accelerate progress on climate change and nutrition. Linking advocacy to action: Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN) In her opening remarks Naeema Al-Gasseer, WHO Representative to Egypt, introduced the ICAN and in particular the next steps to COP28. She highlighted that by COP28, I-CAN is expected to further articulate and amplify a narrative around climate and nutrition action, publish a report outlining the current situation in climate and nutrition action, as well as share a report on pathways to better nutrition and better climate actions. To set the scene of the discussion, Nancy Aburto, Deputy Director of the FAO Food and Nutrition Division, presented FAO\u2019s new findings on systems pathways through which climate and nutrition interact - the agrifood systems, water systems, health systems and social protection systems. She also elaborated on how climate change interacts with the whole agrifood system and its sectors, especially on diet. Her intervention was followed by three speakers focusing on experiences at field level. Country stories from Malawi, Pakistan and Ethiopia Pemphero Chawinga, Nutrition Specialist, spoke about enhancing the Resilience of Agro-Ecological Systems Project (ERASP) in Malawi, with an aim to address land degradation, loss of agro-biodiversity and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Tannaza Sadaf, Portfolio Lead of GAIN Pakistan, demonstrated the importance of utilizing waste (whey) as a resource not only to reduce environmental impact but also to create new products that showed a potential for innovation as well as a new revenue stream in the dairy industry. Sisay Sinamo, Senior Program Manager of the Seqota Declaration Federal Program Delivery Unit and SUN Focal Person at the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia, introduced how Ethiopia integrates nutrition and climate action through the Seqota Declaration, especially by expanding climate smart irrigation potential to improve water-use efficiency and extend growing seasons, as well as improving climate resilient water supply. A panel discussion moderated by Vivian Maduekeh, Climate and Health Program Coordinator of Global Alliance For The Future Of Food (GAFF) ensued speakers\u2019 interventions. The panelists reflected on the case studies presented and discussed the integration of nutrition and health in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to accelerate progress on climate change and nutrition, the need to back piloted concepts with investments, as well as the necessity to collaborate with local partners for scaling up solutions. Healthy diets \u2013 theme of FAO in Geneva Nutrition Dialogue Series in 2023 The FAO Liaison Office in Geneva and the Food and Nutrition Division (ESN) are organizing a series of Nutrition Dialogues in collaboration with the FAO Liaison Office in Brussels to share experiences and practical insights on how intervening in agrifood systems can support better nutrition and in doing so, also support other development outcomes across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The core component of the Nutrition Dialogue Series for 2023 is the sharing of relevant work carried out in agrifood systems in Member States with support from FAO and partners. The series highlights concrete actions in agrifood systems to achieve healthy diets, presenting an opportunity to examine positive actions as well as challenges. Examples showcase how existing activities influence diets and nutrition and where there are opportunities for engagement and collaboration to enhance synergies and manage tradeoffs across a range of development outcomes.

Tillamook County Creamery Association (TCCA) and New Seasons Market (NSM) have teamed up to establish a native riparian forest habitat on farmland in Tillamook County. \u201cCustomers tell us that the brands they shop for, and grocery markets they shop at, should be doing good for the planet,\u201d said Jocelyn Bridson, TCCA Director of Environment and Community Impact. \u201cAt the same time, it is critical that we support farmers as we ask them to implement environmental solutions. We saw an opportunity to engage everyone in the supply chain\u2014from the farmers to the brand to the retailer\u2014to improve environmental impacts and outcomes.\u201d The two brands have come together to create a regenerative agriculture project to sequester carbon and improve ecosystems on farms. To kick off the venture, TCCA and NSM will each provide $15,000 to plant approximately five acres of native, woody vegetation on regional dairy farms within the TCCA Cooperative. The plantings\u2014including diverse species of native trees and shrubs\u2014will sequester carbon, protect and improve water quality, and enhance wildlife habitat. TCCA and NSM also included this project for a USDA Conservation Innovation Grant, noted the release, led by Zero Foodprint and MAD Agriculture. If awarded, it would fund additional acres for restoration. \u201cWorking in partnerships to accelerate regenerative agriculture within our supply chain is part of the solution to creating a low-carbon and resilient regional food economy,\u201d said Athena Petty, New Seasons Market\u2019s Senior Manager of Sustainability. With this plan in place, the companies aim to improve both businesses\u2019 environmental footprints and help TCCA and NSM meet their collective climate goals. As noted in the release, it\u2019s the first time TCCA has partnered with a retail customer on an environmental project. The riparian forest planting will begin over the winter of 2023\u201324 and will provide volunteer opportunities for staff of both B Corp partners. TCCA and NSM are committed to multi-faceted stewardship and helping to mitigate climate change.

In the circular economy formula, repair can be the trickiest variable for most of us. It\u2019s not always feasible to track down a local expert who knows how to fix your item, and even if you do, it may not be an affordable solution. Since Goldmark founded and ran a repair service, we decided to ask her for tips on how and when it makes sense to look for a repair person, and how to do a few basic and common repairs ourselves. She shares tips in the Q&A and videos below. First off, could you tell us more about how fixing stuff is related to sustainability? Currently we live in a largely linear system of production and consumption. We extract resources from the earth. We make them into products that generally don\u2019t last very long, and they go pretty much directly into an incinerator or landfill \u2014 often within a year. This causes a huge amount of emissions \u2014 the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that as much as 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the \u201cproduction and use of everyday items\u201d like food, cars, clothes and much more. It also impacts land use, habitat degradation and therefore biodiversity. It contributes to pollution of waterways and airways, as well as negative impacts on manufacturing communities where people are not always paid a proper living wage. A circular system is necessary as part of a global transition because it means extracting fewer resources from the earth. In a circular system, the materials we do extract are renewable and ethically sourced. It means designing products that will last a long time. It means continuing to manufacture, but also developing systems for collection, remanufacturing, and redistribution \u2014 basically keeping materials in use for as long as possible. And that\u2019s where repair sits. If you have an object that breaks, it should be very simple and logical to just fix it. The problem, of course, is that today in the United States and in many places around the world, it\u2019s incredibly hard to get something fixed. Products are not designed for repair, so they\u2019re hard to fix. New products are artificially cheap, so paying a local craftsman to fix your item is sometimes more expensive than just getting a new one. How did you learn to repair broken items? I worked in theater as a set and costume designer for many years. So I learned to make and fix and paint. They call it upcycling now, but in theater it was more like Frankenstein-ing \u2014 and we do it all the time. You just get really comfortable with a lot of materials and tools. Also, I grew up with a mom who sewed, and who was very handy around the house and would fix all kinds of things. My whole family is a bunch of tinkerers, really. For people who didn\u2019t have that kind of upbringing and experience, where would you recommend that they start? Well, the nice thing about fixing things is it\u2019s really hard to mess it up, because the thing\u2019s already broken. It\u2019s a really wonderful place to get started with tinkering and working with your hands. There are tons of YouTube videos, especially from iFixit, that can teach you how to fix almost anything at home. There are repair cafes all over the country where you can go and volunteers will fix your object, but also teach you how to fix. There are maker spaces where you can practice fixing stuff with somebody who knows how to use the tools. And if you don\u2019t have time to fix it yourself, that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t feel bad. Go get it fixed. See if you can pay somebody to do it. Go to your local cobbler. There\u2019s no shame in it \u2014 in fact, the opposite. I think that the more we do these things at home and also spend money on them in our communities, the more we develop an ecosystem around repair. In the repair service that you ran until 2019, what were some of the most common items you encountered? We got a lot of lamps \u2014 which is why we wanted to show everyone how rewire a lamp [see video]. We got a lot of small appliances, and jewelry. Not fine jewelry, just cheap necklaces and earrings and stuff that people liked and wanted to keep. We got a lot of chairs, tables, and other small furniture. And some oddball stuff, like ceramics and toys. What was interesting was that people mostly brought us everyday objects, not heirlooms and antiques. It wasn\u2019t that people were only reserving repair for specialty items. It was more that repair was so inaccessible to them, that there was no way they could get these kinds of mundane items fixed until we opened our little shops. One of your videos shows us how to darn a sock. Why did you choose to demonstrate that repair? I chose a sock because it\u2019s so easy and satisfying. You don\u2019t need a lot of skills. You don\u2019t need complicated tools. You don\u2019t even need electricity. And you really can extend the life of a nice pair of socks for such a long time. Also, selfishly, my sock has a hole in it and I want to fix it! Let\u2019s go through a quick list of items we might commonly throw out. Is it worth it to try to fix these things? Shoes? For me, dropping off at the cobbler is always a \u2018yes, go for it.\u2019 It has to be good shoes, though \u2014 like you can\u2019t really fix a sneaker sole. The cobbler will tell you if they can repair it or not. What about nonstick pans that have gone sticky? I stopped using nonstick stuff a long time ago because of the chemicals. We switched to cast iron and never looked back. If you season it properly, it\u2019s the ultimate repairable pan because if it starts to get sticky, you just season it again. You put it in the oven with oil and then it becomes nonstick again. It\u2019s totally amazing. Toaster? This one you can forgive yourself for throwing away \u2014 or hopefully recycling. It is incredibly hard to find parts to repair toasters, and it\u2019s incredibly hard to find anybody who will actually fix it for you. But some toasters and microwaves can be recycled in New York City, especially if the housing is metal. Electronics? With electronics, sometimes you can get them repaired, and sometimes you can do it yourself. Fix it if you can. If you can\u2019t, recycle it and buy a used one, knowing that the global statistics on e-waste recycling are really poor. But until that bigger system gets a little better, you\u2019ve done what you can. One of my big philosophies is, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty if you didn\u2019t fix every broken thing in your house, or if you didn\u2019t repair your shoes. My philosophy is that I just try to do the best I can, and work with others to get corporations and policy makers to make it easier for us to do the right thing. Any other tips for people who are just trying their best? On the personal level, the area where I find I am able to make the most concerted effort is actually in the purchasing moment. When I buy something, I\u2019m trying to buy something that is sustainably made, that is repairable. Can you buy a high quality item, used, that\u2019s fixable? That\u2019s when you really have the capacity to impact the end of life of that product. On a bigger level: advocate, advocate, advocate. We\u2019ve got to push for a system where getting all kinds of items fixed is as simple and accessible as pushing that \u201cbuy now\u201d button \u2014 as easy as darning a sock!","filter_flag":1}

The world\u2019s biggest industries have pumped more and more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and the consequences are becoming difficult to ignore. Last year was fraught with extreme weather events, like heatwaves and devastating floods, and this year, more is coming. In fact, early forecasts suggest that a combination of El Ni\u00f1o and the climate crisis could see temperatures exceed 1.5C of warming this year. The prediction is alarming. But, when it comes to climate crisis mitigation, we\u2019re not totally powerless. As individuals, there are some actions we can take to reduce our own environmental impact. In 2018, the world\u2019s biggest food production analysis, conducted at the University of Oxford, concluded that rejecting resource-intensive and pollutive animal agriculture, and adopting a plant-based diet, was the best way a person could reduce their own carbon footprint. \u201cA vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use, and water use,\u201d said lead author Joseph Poore at the time. Unsplash But when it comes to climate action, the truth is, the problem is far bigger than individuals. And that means the solution needs to come from higher up. We are, of course, talking about governmental action. There is a long way to go before many countries, particularly those in the West (who are responsible for most of the world\u2019s emissions), can say they have truly done their part to limit emissions and tackle the climate crisis. But, by pushing plant-based food consumption and supporting alternative protein development, some governments (at a local, state, and central level) have started to take important steps\u2014here are eight examples. 1 Germany At the end of 2022, Germany\u2019s federal minister of food and agriculture Cem \u00d6zdemir proposed Germany\u2019s new National Nutrition Strategy in a paper titled \u201cTowards the Federal Government\u2019s Nutrition Strategy.\u201d The paper acknowledged that the country\u2019s meat consumption was far too high, both from a nutrition and sustainability standpoint. In 2021, Statista notes that German people ate 55kg of meat per capita\u2014lower than in previous years, but still a significant amount.) \u201cHow and what we eat also has far-reaching effects: on the environment, biodiversity, and climate in Germany and worldwide, on animals as our fellow beings, on the agricultural and food industry, and not ultimately on our health and well-being,\u201d the paper noted. It also lays out several goals, including the whole country going carbon neutral by 2045 and ensuring that 30 percent of agricultural goods come from organic farming by 2030, as well as halving food waste in every sector. It noted that to meet these goals, food strategies must embrace seasonal, local, plant-based produce. \u201cThe transformation of the entire food system towards a plant-based diet is the most important adjusting screw in the nutrition sector to achieve our national and international climate, biodiversity, and sustainability goals,\u201d the paper continued. Unsplash 2 The US Across the US, several states and major cities have embraced a more plant-forward approach to food. In New York City, for example, public schools launched Vegan Fridays last year. The initiative means that every Friday, 930,000 children are served plant-based meals. And in March 2022, the city, which has its own vegan mayor, Eric Adams, joined 40 states and cities, including Colorado, by declaring March 20 \u201cMeatOut Day.\u201d The initiative was created by the Farm Animal Rights Movement in a bid to educate more people about the benefits of plant-based diets. On the West Coast, California has also been pushing plant-based diets. In July 2022, it became the first state to support plant-based school meals with a $700 million investment. \u201cWe are grateful to see both the legislature and the Governor recognize the cultural shift towards plant-based choices by supporting our children to eat healthier, more climate-friendly, and humane diets,\u201d said Judie Mancuso, founder of animal advocacy nonprofit Social Compassion in Legislation, at the time. Elsewhere in the US, new legislation in Illinois, set to go into force this year, means that nearly 2 million children have access to plant-based school lunches. And in May 2022, Washington, DC celebrated its first vegan restaurant week thanks to a proclamation signed by Mayor Murial Bowser. \u201cWhereas plant-centric eating lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and those conditions disproportionally undermine the health-related quality of life of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) residents of Washington, DC and whereas a global shift toward plant-centric food norms would help lower greenhouse gas emissions, and governments can play a crucial trailblazing role in facilitating such shifts by their citizenry,\u201d Bowser said at the time. 3 Canada In the four years leading up to December 2022, Protein Industries Canada\u2014which has received funding from the Government of Canada and is one of the country\u2019s five Global Innovation Clusters\u2014invested more than $477 million into Canada\u2019s plant-based food sector. \u201cWe now have projects that span from British Columbia to Prince Edward Island and beyond,\u201d Bill Greuel, the CEO of Protein Industries Canada, said. \u201cMore so, the result of this investment is becoming increasingly tangible, with new ingredients and food products making their way onto grocery shelves and restaurant menus in Canada and beyond.\u201d Also in 2022, the government\u2019s AgriInnovate Program awarded plant-based brand Big Mountain Foods 2 Ltd. more than $1.4 million in funding. 4 Denmark In 2021, the Danish government announced it would be dedicating more than 1.25 billion kroner (around $183 million) to the advancement of the plant-based food sector. The funding was agreed as part of an \u201cunprecedented climate agreement for food and agriculture,\u201d reported the Good Food Institute (GFI) Europe. \u201cWith this announcement, Denmark has recognized the huge potential of sustainable proteins to drive down agricultural emissions, and established itself as Europe\u2019s biggest public investor in plant-based innovation,\u201d Acacia Smith, GFI Europe\u2019s policy manager, said at the time. In 2022, Denmark followed up this agreement by investing more than $100 million into its \u201cPlant Fund.\u201d 5Taiwan In January 2023, a new climate bill, which specifically references the promotion of plant-based, low-carbon diets, passed the legislature in Taiwan. The bill, called the Climate Change Response Act, also enshrines the country\u2019s 2050 net zero targets into law. The move was praised by the Environment & Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST), which has campaigned consistently for an update to Taiwan\u2019s laws regarding the role of food in the climate crisis. \u201cAs the world comes to grips with the importance of food systems in addressing climate change, we are delighted to see an emphasis on low-carbon diets in Taiwan\u2019s climate legislation,\u201d Wu Hung, EAST\u2019s Chief Executive, said. @punehealthsave 6 India In 2021, a grassroots campaign called The Plant Based Treaty launched for the first time. Designed to accompany the Paris Agreement, the treaty aims to \u201cput food systems at the heart of combatting the climate crisis.\u201d So far, thousands of individuals have endorsed the treaty, as well as 20 cities around the world. While Boynton Beach, FL; Los Angeles, CA; Didim, Turkey; Haywards Heath, England; and Edinburgh, Scotland are among the endorsers, most (15) of the cities and towns on the list are located in India. Gopalpur, a coastal town in Odisha, was the most recent Indian town to endorse the treaty. \u201cWe completely agree with the motto \u2018eat plants, plant trees,\u2019\u201d Gopalpur\u2019s council said in a message regarding its endorsement. \u201cWe believe that shifting towards a plant-based diet can solve the climate crisis.\u201d 7 The Netherlands In 2019, Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, announced that meat would no longer be automatically available at government-catered events, starting in 2020. Instead, all menus are vegetarian by default. \u201cThe initiative makes it the individual\u2019s choice of whether to have meat or fish,\u201d Rutger Groot Wassink, the head of operational management, said at the time. \u201cWe are turning the norms upside down. The question is no longer, \u2018Are you vegetarian?\u2019 but \u2018Do you eat meat or fish?\u2019\u201d In 2021, Amsterdam City Council also revealed plans to persuade citizens to go 50-percent plant-based by 2030, and 60-percent plant-based by 2040. Plus in 2022, the central government of the Netherlands showed its support for alternative protein when it allocated \u20ac60 Million for the cultivated meat industry (cultivated meat refers to growing meat from cells in laboratories, so it isn\u2019t plant-based, but it is slaughter-free). 8 Finland In 2020, the Finnish government invested $2.4 million into the country\u2019s plant-based meat sector. And, in December 2022, it was revealed that the funding is paying off. The VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which is owned by the state, announced that it had developed a new innovative technology that would help to perfect plant-based meat products. Essentially, it combines cellular agriculture techniques with plant-based ingredients, and the result tastes just like animal meat. \u201cOur innovation toolkit allows producers to perfectly recreate the sizzling fat and juicy tenderness of meat like never before,\u201d Nesli S\u00f6zer, Research Professor at VTT, said. \u201cBy combining our experience in plant-based ingredients, food design, and cellular agriculture, we can create proof-of-concept of prototypes for tasty, identical meat alternatives that are ready to be scaled up for industrial production.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

If the EPA approves California's rule, other states could later adopt the same standards. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom touted Friday's move as a chance to show \"the world what real climate action looks like.\" \"We're one step closer to achieving healthier neighborhoods and cleaner air for all Californians,\" he said in a statement. The state continues to approve ambitious emissions standards as part of its broader goal of achieving carbon neutrality, meaning it would remove as many carbon emissions as it releases, by 2045. Air regulators previously voted to require that all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs be electric or hydrogen by 2035. And they have banned the sale of new products run by small gas-powered engines, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers and portable generators. The truck emissions vote follows the California Air Resources Board's approval Thursday of a rule phasing out decades-old diesel locomotives and a transition to more zero-emission technology to power trains that transport food, lumber, oil and other products. But some in the trucking industry are concerned the rule will ultimately increase prices for goods that are trucked. The American Trucking Associations called the rule \"unrealistic.\" The group is worried about how expensive a drastic shift to zero-emission vehicles will be and says vehicle-charging infrastructure is not equipped for the transition. \"As it becomes clear that California's rhetoric is not being matched by technology, we hope the Board will reverse course and allow trucking companies the freedom to choose the clean technologies that work best for their operations,\" the group said in a statement. Emissions from trucks have already gone down drastically in recent decades, it said. More than 100 models of zero-emission trucks are available in North America, state regulators say. On top of that, more than 100 others are being produced. Friday's rule, combined with previous electric truck regulations approved by the state, would mean more than 1.6 million zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks would operate in the state by 2048. Nationwide, the transportation sector contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to the EPA, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks contributing nearly a quarter of those emissions. Heavy-duty vehicles make up about 3% of vehicles on the road in California, but they generate more than half of nitrogen oxides and fine particle diesel pollution, according to the California Air Resources Board. That's because these trucks have diesel engines that, while more powerful, produce more pollution than gasoline engines. They also travel many more miles than passenger vehicles. California has lots of these trucks on the road because it has two of the busiest ports in the world at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Long Beach resident Theral Golden said the truck emissions rule is overdue but he wants officials to go further by downsizing the ports. \"We need additional relief,\" Golden said. Of the top 10 most ozone-polluted cities in the U.S., six are in California, according to the American Lung Association's State of the Air report. \"You can't overstate the importance of the actions taken in California today from a public health perspective,\" said Will Barrett, national senior director for clean air advocacy for the American Lung Association. Sam Wilson, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement the technology is available to start transitioning toward electric trucks. \"We need this standard to accelerate the necessary phase-out of fossil-fueled trucks that are fouling our air,\" Wilson said. ___ Associated Press writer Adam Beam contributed to this report. ___ Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press\/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Despite the many attractive opportunities for investing in clean tech, global investments continue to fall short.1 1 \u201cFrom Clean Tech 1.0 to Climate Tech 2.0: A New Era of Investment Opportunities,\u201d B Capital Group, January 17, 2023, https:\/\/www.bcapgroup.com\/from-clean-tech-1-0-to-climate-tech-2-0-a-new-era-of-investment-opportunities\/.

As a result, many of today\u2019s companies lack the technologies they need to decarbonize their operations and value chains. At the current level of investment, the second wave of climate technology innovation will follow the long and winding path of wind and solar: scaling up and reducing carbon emissions over 20 to 30 years. But we do not have 20 to 30 years. To reduce emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to spend $3.5 trillion every year on climate technologies. Starting now. Public and philanthropic funding alone cannot fill this giant gap. But public and philanthropic funding combined with market-shaping mechanisms designed to accelerate the development and scaling of climate technologies can. (See \u201cExecutive Summary.\u201d) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY To achieve global net zero by 2050, the global community must invest $3.5 trillion per year in emerging climate technologies, such as green hydrogen, clean steel, and long-duration energy storage. Emerging climate technologies often require significant amounts of capital with uncertain returns. Market-shaping mechanisms\u2014such as innovative financing, climate-friendly legislation, and industry coalitions\u2014reduce the investment risk. All companies, regardless of size or climate maturity, can play a role in creating a market for emerging climate technologies. To define their role in shaping the market and accelerating deployment of climate tech solutions, leaders should ask: What can my company do now? Define your decarbonization strategy; set tangible, actionable net-zero targets (rather than mere ambitions) and transition plans; issue advance market commitments, especially when you cannot act alone; and set sustainable financing commitments. What can my company do with industry partners now? Execute offtake agreements and volume guarantees, pool procurement of climate technologies, and join industry coalitions. What should I advocate for? Advocate for just transition incentives, support permitting reform, and engage with the public sector to steer future policy. The Power of Market Shaping Market shaping is a strategy used by companies, governments, and investors to address market failures and positively shape the development of a market. By coordinating actions with other stakeholders, organizations can address the bottlenecks and breakdowns that occur within a diverse ecosystem, distribute risk, and leverage purchasing power. In the case of climate technologies, market shaping has the potential to dramatically speed up the green revolution. Consider this. The global equity market cap is $120 trillion, and the global fixed-income market is another $120 trillion. By leveraging innovative market-shaping mechanisms, this huge pool of private capital that would otherwise go to less impactful investments can instead be directed into climate action. Private capital can be used to advance novel technologies faster, scale up proven solutions, and support adaptation and resilience to improve the lives of billions. A decade ago, we saw the power of market-shaping mechanisms in global health when governments and philanthropists committed $1.5 billion to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. This landmark public-private partnership accelerated development and production of pneumococcal vaccines by at least five years, saving over half a million lives. Public and philanthropic funding combined with market-shaping mechanisms are key to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. The same sense of urgency and investment are needed to address the defining challenge of our time: climate change. Market-shaping activities are most effective when multiple players have a stake in the outcome, but limited incentives to act individually. Climate technology producers face uncertainties around the potential demand and willingness to pay for their products, while climate technology buyers can be reluctant to make long-term purchase commitments. Market-shaping mechanisms play a crucial role in creating the collective incentive for players across the climate technology value chain by derisking both demand-side and supply-side factors and encouraging economies of scale. We know what happens if we don\u2019t invest aggressively in climate technologies. Recent models show that if we had invested $5 billion into solar in 1985, solar would have scaled\u2014and started displacing carbon-intensive power eight years sooner.2 2 Financing the Clean Industrial Revolution, Breakthrough Energy, October 29, 2021, https:\/\/breakthroughenergy.org\/news\/financing-the-clean-industrial-revolution\/. Notes: 2 Financing the Clean Industrial Revolution, Breakthrough Energy, October 29, 2021, https:\/\/breakthroughenergy.org\/news\/financing-the-clean-industrial-revolution\/. The Challenges of Scaling Climate Technologies Strategic investments in climate technologies, combined with market-shaping activities, can accelerate the development and deployment of critical climate technologies. The aim of market shaping is to ensure high-potential technologies can successfully cross the so-called valley of death\u2014the gap in funding that exists when companies want to transform a proven concept into a viable and affordable product.

The CPG sector significantly lags other industries in what BCG calls \u201cinnovation readiness,\u201d the underlying capabilities or \u201csystems\u201d that organizations deploy to generate new value propositions and profitably solve customer problems. According to our 2020 MIC findings, companies with mature innovation systems generate as much as 20% more innovation output than their peers. Concerned Consumers The lack of CPG preparedness is especially significant given consumers\u2019 growing climate concerns\u2014and the shift in their buying habits over the past few years. Approximately 80% of consumers say they think about sustainability in their day-to-day purchasing decisions. Also, according to the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business, between 2015 and 2021, sales of products marketed as sustainable grew 2.7 times faster than conventionally marketed products. However, today, only around 10% of CPG shoppers (8% to 18% across the categories we tested) say they purchase sustainable products or have sustainability in their top drivers of choice. This percentage could increase by up to 30% if CPG companies linked sustainability to other emotional and functional needs, such as quality or health. Other BCG research determined that 75% of consumers think that large companies must take the lead against climate change. Clearly, CPG companies must use this opportunity to raise the level of their sustainability efforts. Innovating on Three Levels Given the sheer size and complexity of the value chain, organizations that wish to achieve game-changing innovation in CPG must execute sustainability well at scale. This journey requires applying an innovation lens to three dimensions: products, customers, and advanced digital and AI tools. Improve Today\u2019s Products and Invent Tomorrow\u2019s As a first step toward greater sustainability, organizations should assess their product portfolio to identify the brands that can be made greener as well as those that require marketing to drive awareness and conversion. This is also the time to determine whether any brands should be divested because they don\u2019t align with corporate sustainability ambitions. That move can help fund opportunities in existing brands as well as new categories with greater potential. Product-development teams can then make existing products greener by replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones. Yet while this approach can provide some quick wins, it won\u2019t suffice over the long term. Based on our experience, re-engineering of current operations may achieve only about 30% to 40% of 2030 carbon goals; it is necessary to re-imagine the business model to close the gap, which will require both a transformational portfolio and consumer behavior change. Replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones won\u2019t suffice over the long term. To create truly sustainable products in the future, companies need to develop new products based on new formulations. (See the sidebar on Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev.) Since the primary source of CPG emissions is Scope 3 (the value chain, especially upstream), organizations need to ensure that their suppliers meet sustainability standards. How Two Leading CPGs Are Using Innovation to Boost Sustainability across the Value Chain Leading CPG companies like Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev (ABI) have launched initiatives with the potential for large-scale impact as they put sustainability at the top of their ESG agenda, as well as their overall business agenda. Nestl\u00e9 Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. After determining the carbon footprint of its portfolio, the company has put more emphasis on expansion in the plant-based space, an important commercial and environmental opportunity. To make existing products carbon neutral, Nestl\u00e9 has substituted ingredients and changed entire formulations. The company\u2019s sustainable R&D accelerator and creative application of new R&D processes inspired the formulation used in brands such as Wunda, a pea-based milk alternative. Nestl\u00e9 has also committed to making its product packaging 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. In addition, it has shifted manufacturing to renewable energy and invested in more energy-efficient processes. And it has optimized routes and used low-emission fuels and rail transport. Together, these measures are projected to mitigate 14% of greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the projected 44 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalents by 2030. To fill out its plant-based portfolio, Nestl\u00e9 has also made some noteworthy acquisitions, including Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth foods. In parallel, the company has sold its North American bottled-water business, a slow-growing business with a large environmental footprint, to fund investments in higher-growth categories. This slew of product innovations has been enabled by Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team. A top CEO priority, sustainably minded innovation receives sufficient resources and focus. Moreover, teams are encouraged to explore emerging categories and find applications for R&D developments across the Nestl\u00e9 portfolio. For example, Nestl\u00e9 is using lessons from Wunda to develop other innovations in the dairy-alternative space. By embedding sustainability every step of the way, Nestl\u00e9 is driving both incremental and game-changing innovation\u2014and raising the bar in the process. ABI To help address the growing global demand for food and the pressure this is putting on natural resources, ABI is leveraging its brewing expertise to find new ways of sourcing food sustainably. In addition to rolling out many incremental innovations, ABI has launched ventures that develop new-to-world technologies. One of its startups, EverGrain, is developing a technology that extracts the proteins and fibers from brewing grains to create nutrient-rich ingredients for use in protein shakes, breads, and milk alternatives. Another startup, BioBrew, is using ABI\u2019s fermentation knowledge to scale production of alternative proteins. ABI\u2019s ventures are expected to help reduce crop- and livestock-related carbon emissions from food production while providing access to new markets Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.

This is a huge undertaking, requiring bold experimentation with supply-chain and sourcing models. Companies will need to expand their roster of partners. They will also need to change relationships with existing partners to active collaborations where companies share product-development expertise and work with suppliers to develop sustainable practices. Since CPG companies are positioned to be the steward of the value chain, they need to engage with partners to drive broader impact. Guinness, for example, recently launched a regenerative-agriculture pilot in Ireland to reduce the carbon emissions from producing barley, a key raw material. Working with farmers and other suppliers, Guinness expects to see improvements in soil health and water quality, as well as enhanced biodiversity. Help Consumers Change Their Behaviors While these efforts will go a long way, innovation in CPG won\u2019t be able to maximize the impact of decarbonization measures unless consumers take a more active role. Yet while consumers are increasingly concerned about the climate crisis, many have not yet incorporated sustainability into their everyday behaviors, and many are confused about their role (around 20% say that individuals have a role to play in climate change). Companies, therefore, need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. One solution is to innovate and commercialize products in a way that resonates deeply with potential buyers, understanding their core needs and barriers to ensure that sustainable products address them. To maximize the impact of decarbonization measures, companies need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. That is exactly what Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s Finish did in 2020, when the maker of dishwashing products launched \u201cSkip the Rinse,\u201d a campaign that aimed to drive growth and also conserve water by encouraging consumers not to pre-rinse their dishes. Reckitt innovated its product, and the key benefit was that busy families could save time and effort while effectively cleaning their dishes, which appealed to a much broader audience than sustainability alone. As an added benefit, for every consumer who pledged to #skiptherinse, Finish agreed to donate $1 to The Nature Conservancy. In less than two years, more than 20 million gallons of water were conserved. In addition, Finish drove share growth and increased marketing ROI. Deploy Next-Generation Digital and AI Tools Advanced analytics driven by AI provide the transparency that\u2019s necessary for identifying the C&S leads with the greatest likelihood of success. These next-generation tools include machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping, Unlike traditional methods, advanced analytics allow an organization to combine multiple data sources to identify potential targets across multiple sectors globally and further upstream. Moreover, they enable the automated scraping of websites and social media to identify business signals (triggers) in areas of the organization\u2019s choosing, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Third, they help to quickly narrow down searches to a short list of the most promising opportunities. No less important, these tools enable traceability, both for companies that wish to monitor the greenness of their suppliers and for consumers who want to know whether the product they\u2019re thinking of purchasing has green roots. Advanced analytics can help identify C&S leads and enable traceability. Given both the immensity of the C&S opportunity and our relative nascency in addressing it, advanced analytics and AI tools (including machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping) can help drive impact at critical junctures across the innovation value chain. Companies deploying these tools will be better able to surface valuable insights, prioritize the innovation focus, explore the C&S implications of potential product features during the design stage, and identify emerging technologies and partners to add to their innovation ecosystems. In all likelihood, CPG companies will play a central role in the ultimate success or failure of the C&S effort. Therefore, it\u2019s only fitting that they use this role to bring us closer to a decarbonized future. By applying an innovative lens to the sustainability agenda, companies can create value\u2014for the environment, for consumers, and for themselves. But to create a real sustainability advantage, organizations must act now, before this source of differentiation evaporates.","filter_flag":1}

Admittedly, not all of them have been well-received (we\u2019re looking at you, Sainsbury\u2019s\u2026), but it\u2019s common knowledge that humans need to cut down on single-use plastic. Despite this, supermarket fruit and veg aisles still feature row upon row of apples, bananas and other fresh produce, all tightly wrapped in plastic packaging. However, this might not be the case for much longer. Currently, some fresh produce can be found both loose and packaged \u2013 but climate action organisations are calling for this to be applied across the board, with the ultimate goal of eliminating plastic packaging entirely. The move would remove an estimated 1.7 billion pieces of plastic packaging from usage, avoid over 77,000 tonnes of food being wasted, and save shoppers a combined total of over \u00a385 million in uneaten food. It\u2019s hard to argue against the idea. But despite the hugely positive impact the move would have, consumers remain reluctant to take it up. Although loose food is not a new thing (hello \u2018pick and mix\u2019), it seems that when the same rule is applied to fruit and veg, shoppers aren\u2019t quite as keen on the idea, citing a range of concerns including hygiene and cost. Is the goal a realistic one for the grocery sector? What are the current targets? While climate action NGO Wrap originally hoped that 80% of packaging on fresh fruit and veg could be removed by 2025, last week it updated this estimation, cutting back plans to a new goal of 30% by 2025. Industry experts said the initial target was too ambitious and that supermarkets would not be able to deliver. Under the new industry pathway, retailers are encouraged to work towards each target as a minimum. Specifically looking to change the way apples, aubergines, avocados, bananas, broccoli, cabbages, carrots, ginger, garlic, lemons, limes, mangos, onions, oranges, parsnips, pears, peppers, potatoes, squash, swede and salad tomatoes are purchased, the first target wants supermarkets to be selling at least one line across each of these items loose, if two or more types of that product are stocked. By the end of 2024, this will be applied to each produce line, rising to 30% of all uncut fresh produce volume sales in store loose by 2025. By the end of 2030, the aim is for this to extend to 50%. \u201cNobody wants to see good food go to waste or add to the tide of plastic packaging which blights our streets and beautiful countryside,\u201d Defra minister, Rebbeca Pow says. \u201cThis ambitious new initiative will help to tackle both these issues and builds on recent government efforts in this area.\u201d Fresh Produce Consortium regulation and communications manager, Kelly Shields adds that Wrap\u2019s pathways, which comes ahead of GB legislative requirements, \u201cshow pro-active commitment from the fresh produce industry\u201d. Wrap\u2019s research found that if plastic packaging was removed from the top five most wasted fresh fruit and veg products alone, 100,000 tonnes of food waste could be prevented. What are supermarkets doing and is it enough? Many convenience stores and discount grocers are unable to offer loose products, with just 15% of fruit and veg sales currently coming from loose products. This is for a number of reasons; not least the lack of weighing facilities. It\u2019s a different story at the larger supermarkets though, where a Waitrose spokesperson told Grocery Gazette that it remains on target to meet Wrap\u2019s 2030 ambition. \u201cOur loose fruit and veg remain a popular choice. We\u2019re working hard to increase our packaging-free selection, whilst also offering great value products that meet our high standards on quality and taste.\u201d As active members of the Wrap working group which \u201cexplores opportunities to reduce packaging and offer more loose products, without affecting product quality or longevity\u201d, Asda is also pushing forward with plastic-free produce. A spokesperson revealed the supermarket is \u201ccurrently trialling more loose produce lines\u201d at its trial store in Leeds, \u201cto see if more can be rolled out across all our stores as we look towards the 50% target by 2030\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s also told Grocery Gazette it is \u201ccommitted to reducing our own-brand plastic packaging by 50% by 2025 by removing any unnecessary plastic packaging where possible\u201d. However, the Big 4 grocer acknowledged customer concerns, adding that packaging \u201cplays a vital role\u201d in keeping the supermarkets food \u201csafe and fresh.\u201d \u201cSince 2019 we have implemented a range of initiatives including removing single use plastic bags from loose fruit and veg. We will continue to work with Wrap to meet the targets set out in the UK Plastics Pact,\u201d the spokesperson added. Despite this, City to Sea head of campaigns Jo Morley doesn\u2019t think that supermarkets are doing enough, pointing out that removing plastic packaging from fruit and veg \u201cis nothing new,\u201d adding \u201cit\u2019s already happening in France and other countries in Europe.\u201d France has already banned 30 fruits and vegetables from being wrapped in plastic packaging and Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg are set to follow later this year. Morley says supermarkets need to help customers to \u201cchoose loose\u201d. While Everyday Plastic founder and director, Daniel Webb admits that removing packaging from fruit and veg is a \u201cbig and complex task,\u201d he says that the pledges made by supermarkets in the Wrap report are \u201cjust another set of unambitious, voluntary commitments\u201d. \u201cThey are not acting urgently enough nor seeing how huge this opportunity is for pioneering and positive change. Together, we must help shoppers to save plastic, money, and food waste by encouraging them to choose loose.\u201d Are shoppers ready to go plastic-free? Although supermarkets are moving in the right direction, TGW Logistics Group vice president, James Osborn says that shoppers are \u201cjust not ready\u201d for the move yet. He cites the top reason for this as hygiene. A recent survey by Everyday Plastic and Find Out Now also confirmed that hygiene is one of the major concerns that many shoppers have about buying loose fresh produce, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Osborn suggests that a \u201cmedium term solution\u201d could be \u201cmore sustainable products for movement and reuse or recycling.\u201d He suggests that rather than scrapping packaging entirely, the industry could instead explore new products and materials that \u201cminimise our impact on the environment\u201d, but still meet \u201cchallenging physical demands\u201d. Other concerns include produce longevity and cost, with many assuming (wrongly) that loose produce is more expensive. Research from Wrap also shows that plastic packaging does not actually help to prolong the life of uncut fresh fruit, and that refrigeration is more effective. Former Friends of the Earth campaigner and Everyday Plastic board member, Julian Kirby points out that by making loose fruit and veg more expensive, supermarkets are \u201cpenalising people who want to do the right thing\u201d. He adds that \u201crather than helping customers say no to pointless plastic, it appears supermarkets are actively encouraging them to buy more\u201d. While the efforts of Wrap and other environmental organisations certainly haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by retailers, it\u2019s also clear that more can be done. If each of the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets were able to maintain 50% of uncut fresh produce sales in store loose by 2030, that would be an undeniable achievement for the industry. However, with that goal still seven years away, it also gives supermarkets no excuse in not encouraging, educating and incentivising consumers to get on board with this more sustainable way of shopping.","filter_flag":1}

I am very excited to be here in Brussels, which is the first stop for my trip this time in Europe. I am happy to tell you that Hong Kong has fully returned to normalcy, and I would like to take the opportunity tonight to share with you our latest development in financial services, in particular green finance and fintech.Green financeReducing carbon emissions and realising sustainable development are high priorities for governments, institutions and communities all over the world. I noticed that the EU (European Union) sets out a \"Fit for 55\" package, which is a set of proposals to revise and update EU legislation and to put in place new initiatives with the aim of ensuring that EU policies are in line with the climate goals agreed by the Council and the European Parliament. The European climate law makes reaching the EU's climate goal of reducing EU emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030 a legal obligation. EU countries are working on new legislation to achieve this goal and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.Hong Kong earnestly shares the global vision in pursuit of a greener world. Our country is advancing towards the \"3060 Dual Carbon Targets\". The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government also announced Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 in October 2021, targeting to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by 50 per cent before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. Behind the recent Budget's numbers and initiatives is the importance the HKSAR Government places on high-quality development, and that includes transformation to a green economy. We will also position Hong Kong as an international centre for green tech and green finance.The global pursuit to carbon neutrality has created a huge demand for innovative and technological solutions to reduce, mitigate or offset carbon emission, ranging from environmental engineering and carbon sequestration to the production of more environmentally friendly products.The global market for green technology is forecast to reach more than US$410 billion by 2030. That is more than 11 times the total from just two years ago. The opportunities for green finance are hence boundless. It has been estimated that the green financing needs in Asia alone would reach US$66 trillion for the next three decades. For Mainland China alone, US$14.5 trillion.Hong Kong is a leading player in green finance. In 2022, green and sustainable debts arranged or issued in Hong Kong amounted to over US$80.5 billion. The HKSAR Government has issued nearly US$16 billion government green bonds since 2019, including US$2.5 billion (HK$20 billion) retail green bond in May last year, as well as US$101 million (HK$800 million) tokenised green bond in February this year, the first of its kind released anywhere in the world by a government, as our attempt to further entrench the awareness of sustainability issues in combination with technology.We are establishing a Green Technology and Finance Development Committee, which will be tasked to work out an action agenda on a number of areas, namely:(a) building a green technology ecosystem to attract top-notch enterprises or start-ups to set up their operations in Hong Kong;(b) continuing to develop green financing, helping green projects and companies get the capital they need faster and easier;(c) promoting green certification and green standard setting and converging the Mainland and international standards;(d) nurturing talents, through providing local training as well as attracting talents from all over the world; and(e) enhancing collaboration with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the international markets.Moreover, the launch of Core Climate by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited last October for the trading of international voluntary carbon credits signifies a critical step forward in the development of carbon marketplace in Hong Kong. Carbon credits on the platform come from internationally certified carbon projects from around the world, including carbon avoidance, reduction and removal projects. All projects listed on Core Climate are verified against international standards.FintechTurning to Fintech development in Hong Kong. The Fintech landscape in Hong Kong is incredibly diverse and dynamic. We are now home to over 800 fintech companies and over 3 900 start-ups, offering a wide range of innovative services such as mobile payments, cross-border transfers, intelligent financial consultancy, wealth management, virtual asset trading, and blockchain. We were the pioneers in issuing virtual bank and virtual insurance company licences. Currently, we have eight such banks and four such insurance companies.Talking about insurance, the HKSAR Government issued the Development Roadmap for the Insurance Sector in Hong Kong in December last year, which outlines our visions and missions in developing the insurance sector, including:(a) to sharpen our competitive edge as a global risk management centre, and boost the synergies between different financial sectors to provide holistic risk and wealth management solutions facing a global clientele;(b) to enlarge the market accessible by our insurance sector through proactive policy initiatives and facilitative legislation;(c) to achieve balanced development of long-term and general businesses, strengthening Hong Kong as a sophisticated insurance hub;(d) to leverage on our unique advantages under the \"one country, two systems\" principle and integrate the insurance sector into national development riding on the \"Dual Circulation\" strategy; and(e) to give full play to the distinctive role of insurance in providing comprehensive risk management and mitigation solutions to all members of the public, thereby unleashing its social value.In fact, insurtech is a field that we strive to foster in Hong Kong. Our Insurance Authority has launched the Fast Track and Insurtech Sandbox in this regard to facilitate the insurtech development in Hong Kong. We observe that traditional insurers are seeking partnership with insurtech start-ups or technology providers to develop new products, models and tools, covering various aspects of the insurance value chain. From the Insurtech Survey done earlier, about 70 per cent of insurers would sustain investment in insurtech over the next three years.Hong Kong has one of the highest consumer fintech adoption rates (67 per cent) in the world, ranking above markets including France, the US (United States) and Japan. It also has a high B2B adoption rate of fintech with 66 per cent of fintech companies focusing on the B2B market. The city also serves as a platform for Mainland China, the world's top consumer market for fintech, with 51 per cent of companies operating or planning to expand in the GBA.To facilitate the incubation of innovative financial products, we launched the Fintech Proof-of-Concept Subsidy Scheme (PoC Subsidy Scheme) in February 2021, granting subsidies to fintech institutions to partner with financial institutions to test new and practical fintech solutions. A new round of PoC Subsidy Scheme was also rolled out in September 2022, and the scheme has been expanded to research institutions. The two rounds of schemes have approved over 140 projects.I would also like to talk more about virtual assets. I understand that the EU has reached agreement on groundbreaking Markets in Crypto-Assets rules for licensing and supervision. In fact, in October last year, we also published a Policy Statement on Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong, which sets out policy stance and approach towards developing a vibrant sector and ecosystem for virtual assets in Hong Kong. We will put in place timely and necessary guardrails to mitigate actual and potential risks in line with international standards, so that virtual asset innovations can thrive in Hong Kong in a sustainable manner. We have passed the legislation to introduce a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers with a view to ensuring that relevant services and service providers will be subject to appropriate supervision. Moreover, we have so far three crypto asset ETFs (exchange-traded funds) listed in Hong Kong, representing average daily turnover of about HK$7 million in February 2023.Hong Kong has what it takes to rise as a world leader in green finance and fintech to support an integrated and dynamic green industry cluster with a complete value chain.Both the EU and Hong Kong are pioneers in the area of green finance and we understand how new financial technologies facilitate access to financial services and improve the efficiency of the financial system for better development of green economy despite challenges under the worsening macroeconomic environment.We look forward to collaborating with the EU to promote a better greener world by making use of technology.

Crown Coaches has always had a focus on a sustainable future, with long-term investment in the most efficient vehicles for its bus and coach services. The choice to use opt-in Carbon Neutral Diesel is the next step in its journey towards a low or zero carbon future. Viva Energy\u2019s Carbon Solutions team works with a range of industry sectors to help customers with their decarbonisation journey and has been pivotal in the introduction of Climate Active-certified opt-in carbon neutral products. Climate Active is an ongoing partnership between the federal government and Australian business to drive voluntary climate action. Viva Energy\u2019s Chief Business Development and Sustainability Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer says the move to use opt-in carbon neutral fuels is expected to become an important transitional solution for more businesses as they embark on their decarbonisation journey. \u201cWe recognise that customers have a complex journey ahead of them to decarbonise their businesses, especially when they have fleets of heavy vehicles reliant on traditional fossil fuel products,\u201d Pfeiffer says. RELATED ARTICLE: Viva Energy hydrogen super station to begin work in Geelong this year \u201cOur Carbon Solutions team has been working with commercial customers to navigate their way to a lower carbon future with a range of new products and solutions.\u201d Pfeiffer says that while new low-emission technologies such as hydrogen and EVs are on the way, transitional solutions are needed to lower the net carbon intensity for existing vehicles. \u201cThat is why products like opt-in Carbon Neutral Diesel and other low carbon fuels can help customers in the short and medium term to meet their decarbonisation goals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a range of customers talking to us about these products across industries such as mining, construction, marine and heavy trucking.\u201d Crown Coaches Business Development Manager Ivan Furlanetto says the company has been looking for opportunities to be more efficient and contribute to environmentally sustainable solutions. He says Crown started talking to Viva Energy about low-carbon fuel options after hearing a presentation at the Victorian Transport Association Alternative Fuel Summit last year. \u201cViva Energy was talking about a range of low carbon pathways, including carbon neutral fuels, and we saw this as an important step towards reducing our carbon footprint,\u201d Furlanetto says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this with Viva Energy since January this year and have been using their opt-in Carbon Neutral Diesel fuel in all our vehicles. We see this as a bridging solution while we continue to transition our bus fleet to fully electric vehicles over the next few years. \u201cThe carbon credits used in offsetting the emissions associated with our diesel use are purchased and retired by Viva Energy on our behalf. \u201cWe are a local company and wanted this to have a local impact so we selected to use exclusively Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU\u2019s) so we knew the purchase of this fuel was supporting Australian carbon projects.\u201d Viva Energy is continuing to explore the introduction of new low carbon fuels, products and infrastructure to address the needs of its customers. These include fuels produced from alternative feedstocks, hydrogen refuelling and EV charging amongst others. Viva Energy\u2019s New Energies Service Station, being developed in Geelong, will offer fast hydrogen refuelling for heavy vehicles as well as diesel and electric charging facilities \u2013 all co-located at one of the first publicly accessible refuelling sites of its kind in Australia. The site is due to begin construction in late 2023.","filter_flag":1}

Given its robust economic growth over the past three decades, Asia is also now the leading contributor of annual global greenhouse gas emissions with a 51% share. Asia\u2019s pivotal role in global supply chains puts it at the center of a complex web of interregional embedded emissions. As a result, Asia\u2014the most vital engine of global economic growth and the region most vulnerable to the impacts of unchecked emissions growth\u2014is at the heart of the climate crisis. But businesses in Asia also have the greatest opportunity to lead on climate and transform their business for competitive advantage. Asia\u2019s Climate Challenge The world is already struggling to align with the necessary changes to achieve the critical 1.5\u00b0C Paris agreement pathway\u2014a fact laid bare in the recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Sixth Assessment Report.1 1 IPCC, Sixth Assessment Report, 2023, https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar6\/. Notes: 1 IPCC, Sixth Assessment Report, 2023, https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar6\/. The implications for Asia on the current trajectory are extreme: a severe increase of 3.2\u00b0C, could deliver a 26% dip in GDP for Asia. Southeast Asia fares even more poorly, with an expected hit of 37% to GDP. These economic impacts stand alongside far-reaching social and health considerations. Heading off such scenarios requires accelerated action in Asia. The region must deliver more than half of the emissions reductions needed to achieve the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.2 2 IEA, Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/global-energy-and-climate-model\/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze. Notes: 2 IEA, Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/global-energy-and-climate-model\/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze. But the climate solutions in Asia are not straightforward. The region is diverse, and the need to deliver a just energy transition that balances economic growth, upward mobility, security, affordability, and sustainability means there is no one-size-fits-all solution that can be rolled out across the region. Asia\u2019s Sustainability Opportunity The economic and business opportunity for Asia in driving to net zero is commensurate with the challenge. Asia is projected to unlock 43% ($4.3 trillion) of the $10.1 trillion revenue opportunity available by 2030 from activities like the expansion of renewable power, energy efficiency in buildings, transportation and agriculture, and greater circularity in producing industries. The story of job growth is equally compelling, with more than half (58%) of the 395 million jobs required to service those opportunities situated in Asia. The economic and business opportunity for Asia in driving to net zero is commensurate with the challenge. Companies have an essential role in realizing this opportunity and tackling overarching climate risks. Like the nuanced challenges faced by nations across the region, there is no sufficient single response. Corporations will need to define and implement both adaptation and mitigation strategies while also taking steps to support a just energy transition. To achieve this companies can adopt an approach based on best practices in the short-, medium-, and long-term: Take immediate action . This includes making climate action a top CEO priority, gaining a clear understanding of climate opportunities and risks, setting clear decarbonization targets and milestones, and fully leveraging existing cost-efficient emissions solutions. . This includes making climate action a top CEO priority, gaining a clear understanding of climate opportunities and risks, setting clear decarbonization targets and milestones, and fully leveraging existing cost-efficient emissions solutions. Enable transformation . Companies must mobilize the organization and resources to deliver climate impact and accelerate ecosystem collaboration, including to address Scope 3 emissions. . Companies must mobilize the organization and resources to deliver climate impact and accelerate ecosystem collaboration, including to address Scope 3 emissions. Unlock new growth. Climate action provides opportunities for companies to build out new capabilities and businesses, powering new green growth both within and beyond their existing value chain. Certainly many companies in Asia and elsewhere are just beginning this journey. But we see a number of forward-looking Asian companies that are already driving tangible climate outcomes across key industries, including real estate, energy, transport, and agriculture. Unmitigated climate change is the biggest threat of our generation. Corporate inaction on climate has a negative business impact. Conversely, timely corporate climate action will yield tremendous growth opportunities. Asian corporate leaders can make bold changes\u2014for the good of their business and the world.
