The PCR pails drive the use of recycled plastic, helping reduce plastic waste, and enabling sustainable progress. The company's 50% PCR pails, first in pails packing for lubricating oils in India, aim to help customers reduce waste, convert waste to value and advance sustainability ambitions. Mobil launches 50% post-consumer recycled plastic pails in India Vipin Rana, Chief Executive Officer, ExxonMobil Lubricants Pvt. Ltd., said, \"Mobil can help create value by advancing customers' mobility, productivity, and sustainability ambitions. Our initiative to transition to 50% post-consumer recycled plastic pails is just one example of how we are advancing our customers' sustainability ambitions. We understand the ever-changing needs of our customers and stakeholders and are committed to operating our business in an accountable and sustainable manner, supplying feature products by minimizing the environmental impacts, and supporting the communities in which we operate.\" ExxonMobil has emerged as a categorical leader in the diversion of waste in lubricant facilities. All Mobil products manufactured in the company's global network of lubricant facilities carry the Underwriters Laboratories Zero Waste to Landfill, Silver Validation, first earned in 2018. This validation recognizes ExxonMobil's commitment to reducing waste and advancing a circular economy. Additionally, ExxonMobil continues to be the first and only finished lubricants marketer to carry this credential, and each year diverts more than 90% (over 50,000 tons) of lubricant operations waste from landfills into new productive uses. ExxonMobil is also leveraging scale and integration to increase the production of certified circular plastics and meet growing demand. In December 2022, the company announced the successful startup of one of the largest advanced recycling facilities in North America. The facility at the integrated manufacturing complex in Baytown, Texas, uses proprietary technology to break down hard-to-recycle plastics and transforms them into raw materials for new products. The recycling facility in Baytown is capable of processing more than 80 million pounds of plastic waste per year, supporting a circular economy for post-use plastics and helping divert plastic waste currently sent to landfills.
