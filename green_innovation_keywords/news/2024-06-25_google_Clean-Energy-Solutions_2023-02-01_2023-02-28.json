This will enhance Greentech's offerings by providing a comprehensive storage solution to its diverse customer base, in addition to its already established solar panel offerings. Exro's Cell Driver\u2122 \u2013 The World's Safest and Most Advanced Energy Storage System Solar panels have one job: They collect energy from sunlight and transform it into electricity. But they can make that energy only when the sun is shining. That's why the ability to store solar energy for later use is important: It helps to keep the balance between electricity generation and demand. Simply put, a solar-plus-storage system is a battery system that is charged by a connected solar system. Many solar-energy system owners are looking at ways to connect their system to a battery so they can use that energy at night or in the event of a power outage. According to Bloomberg's NEF Global Energy Storage Market Report for 2022, the global market for stationary energy storage is forecast to reach US$125+ billion by 2030. Exro's Cell Driver\u2122 is positioned to capture this rapidly expanding use case market for energy storage. With the global push towards sustainable clean energy solutions, the market outlook for stationary energy storage continues to grow. Stress on utility grids has resulted in rolling blackouts in places such as California, Texas, Arizona and more. These blackouts, combined with inflated peak rate charges for electricity, highlight the growing need for flexible backup energy storage solutions, particularly for commercial and industrial applications. The Exro Cell Driver\u2122 provides an increased depth of control over battery cells, resulting in superior charging, deeper discharge rates, enhanced safety, and continuous operation. This enables commercial and industrial buildings to manage energy consumption, safeguard against grid outages, store energy produced on-site, and realize benefits through peak shaving and load shifting. Cell Driver\u2122 is also equipped with Exro's proprietary Battery Control System\u2122, that actively manages cells based on their State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH). This enables micro-protection mechanisms to electronically isolate faults, significantly reducing chances of thermal runaways, without any disruptions to system operation. Combined, the Exro Cell Driver\u2122 confronts challenges facing the stationary energy storage market and also provides an optimal solution for influx of retired electric vehicle batteries with its active cell balancing functionalities by repurposing into a second life in stationary energy storage. Exro's Cell Driver\u2122 remains on schedule to complete UL Certification in late Q2 2023 \u2013 certification required to connect to the power grid in North America. Product Inquiry Contact Please see link to the Exro's Cell Driver\u2122 product catalog: Exro-Cell-Driver-Catalog.pdf Greentech is now accepting orders for Cell Driver\u2122 for delivery in Q3 2023.

The investment marks Masdar's entry into geothermal energy, in the second-largest geothermal market in the world. Geothermal energy plant in Indonesia (PRNewsfoto\/Masdar) HE Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, and Chairman, Masdar, said, \"Achieving the 1.5C target set out in the Paris Accords will require humanity to leverage all sources of low-carbon energy, including sources that are currently under-utilized, like geothermal. Through its investment in PGE, Masdar is demonstrating its continuing commitment to Indonesia's energy transition and its support of one of the major focus areas of the upcoming COP28, which is to provide practical energy security solutions while reducing emissions.\" Ahmad Yuniarto, Chief Executive Officer, PGE, said, \"We look forward to working with Masdar in the areas which complement and grow further our capabilities to be a world class green energy company, with the largest geothermal capacity globally. We endeavor to develop 600 megawatts (MW) in additional installed capacity over the next five years to support Indonesia's renewable energy mix.\" Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer, Masdar, said, \"Masdar's strategic investment in PGE will complement our already strong footprint in Indonesia, the world's second largest geothermal market. We are especially excited to add geothermal energy to our clean energy portfolio, a clean energy source that can deliver dispatchable power 24 hours a day, which further underscores our position as a global leader in delivering clean energy solutions that help drive the global energy transition.\" Indonesia has a goal of increasing its installed geothermal capacity from 2.8 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 6.2 GW by 2030. The Government is targeting net-zero emissions by 2060 and having renewables provide 23 percent of the energy mix by 2023. PGE has been operating geothermal facilities in Indonesia for the last 40 years, with a portfolio capacity exceeding 1.87 GW. Geothermal energy harnesses the heat generated within the Earth's core to provide a constant energy source, unlike solar or wind, which are intermittent in nature. Geothermal energy plants also have high-capacity factors, meaning they can run at maximum power for longer periods. These attributes mean geothermal energy could potentially play a significant role in the clean energy transition, helping nations with a high concentration of geothermal activity to reduce carbon emissions. The PGE investment is the latest in Masdar's ongoing effort to expand and increase its strategic partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. Masdar is already developing the region's largest floating solar facility \u2013 the 145-MW Cirata Floating Solar PV Plant in Indonesia \u2013 and last year signed an agreement with Tuas Power, EDF Renewables, and PT Indonesia Power to explore development of up to 1.2 GW solar capacity in Indonesia for export to Singapore. Masdar recently announced a new shareholding structure and additional focus on green hydrogen, making it one of the largest clean energy companies of its kind. With a goal of achieving 100 GW renewable energy capacity and green hydrogen production of 1 million tonnes per annum annually by 2030, the new Masdar is a clean energy powerhouse that will spearhead the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative and drive the global energy transition.
