EIT Food is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union, and research, based on a survey of nearly 10,000 consumers from 18 European countries, found that 67% said they would use such a label, while just 13% felt they would be unlikely to do so. Label greenwashing The research comes on the back of a special label greenwashing and what it means to eat \u2018clean\u2019 report on ConfectioneryNews\u200b - and has been released to mark the launch of the new Consumer Observatory. Part of EIT Food, the Consumer Observatory aims to bring together the breadth of consumer insights and knowledge from the world\u2019s largest food innovation community. While there are currently no internationally agreed standards for environmental sustainability labelling and no agreement on what sustainable production should measure, authorities are discussing the development of a common eco-label that would inform consumers about the impact that food products have on the climate and society. The research found that almost two-thirds of Europeans - 63% - believe food brands pretend their products are more sustainable than they really are, while only a third of Europeans, 33%, believe their government is transparent about regulating sustainability labels on food. Klaus Grunert, Professor at Denmark\u2019s Aarhus University and Director of the EIT Food Consumer Observatory, said: \u201cIn a world where there are over 450 sustainability logos in operation, many companies use green claims and eco-labels to help market their products. But currently, there is no universal standard for these labels, leaving many consumers confused by all the different symbols and logos on the market\u200b. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from our research that consumers want to be better informed about the environmental footprint of their food and that there is widespread support for a universal, independent and factually substantiated label for sustainable food products. Introducing such a label - and ensuring that all eco-labels include clear and concise information - could be the best way to empower consumers to make informed choices about how what they eat impacts the planet\u200b.\u201d Among the 18 countries surveyed, Italy, Spain and Poland were those with the highest levels of support for such a label, with 81%, 79% and 78% of consumers respectively saying they would use it, while Czech consumers are the least supportive (45%). In Turkey, 40% of consumers said they would be \u201cvery likely\u201d to use it. The recyclability of the packaging, animal welfare, and pollution and the use of chemicals and fertilisers were the areas that consumers most wanted to see covered by an eco-label, with 90%, 89% and 88% of consumers saying they would like to see these respective elements. The research also found: Consumers in the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Romania are particularly distrustful of their governments, with just 21%, 24% and 27% respectively saying they believe they are transparent about regulating ecolabels on food. Women are more sceptical of government than men: just 31% felt they were transparent when regulating eco-labels compared to 36% of male respondents. The Netherlands, Germany and Ireland are the countries where people have the least trust in food brands\u2019 green claims, with 73%, 69% and 69% of consumers respectively saying they believe they pretend their products are more sustainable than they are. Commenting on the launch, Sofia Kuhn, Director of Public Engagement at EIT Food, said: \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture: the food system must be transformed if we are to succeed in ensuring it can deliver healthy, sustainable food for all. In the Consumer Observatory, a crucial forum now exists to help realise this aim within Europe, putting consumer insights at the forefront. The knowledge the Consumer Observatory gathers into consumer behaviours will be available to food systems actors to help reach the shared goal of driving forward a healthier and more sustainable food system.\u201d\u200b","filter_flag":1}

The problematic plastics category has spurred a new investment partnership between global giant Nestl\u00e9 and technology company Impact Recycling\u200b. Eco-focused tech developer Impact Recycling has developed a breakthrough plastic recycling tech that will be at the centre of the company\u2019s new UK recycling plant. Nestl\u00e9 is investing \u00a37 million into Impact Recycling, which it hopes will advance how the food and beverage industry handles hard-to-recycle plastics in an environmentally responsible way. Along with a grant from Innovate UK, the plastics facility will be operational in late Summer 2024. \u201cWe want to look for solutions where we can invest to stimulate the development of much-needed recycling infrastructure in the UK,\u201d \u200bSokhna Gueye, Head of Packaging at Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland, told FoodNavigator. The problems around plastic recycling\u200b Plastics-focused plans, targets and advocates are gaining ground in the UK, spurring change in food and beverage operations. The UK government\u2019s waste reduction strategy\u200b, the Plastics Pact\u200b and Innovate UK\u2019s Circular Plastics Network\u200b seeks to eliminate the detrimental environmental impact of plastics. Flexible plastic packaging makes up a quarter of the UK consumer packaging, yet only 8% was collected for recycling in 2022, for example, Ecosurety, a B Corp-certified UK compliance scheme, shared\u200b. In response, Nestl\u00e9 stated it has undertaken extensive efforts to redesign its flexible packaging, transitioning from complex multi-material structures to simpler mono-material designs that are easier to recycle. \u201cUnfortunately, the current recycling infrastructure in the UK is not adequately equipped to handle these materials,\u201d \u200bsaid Gueye. \u201cThis investment aims to address this pressing challenge and improve recycling capacity for flexible packaging,\u201d\u200b added Gueye. The UK\u2019s Plastics Pact\u200b, launched by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) charity, aims to address plastic waste\u2019s impact on climate change. It aims to meet several targets: to eliminate problematic plastics, understand reusable versus recyclable packaging, increase plastics recycling to 70% and achieve 30% recycled content. The UK charity encourages more companies to engage in industry innovation and progress to achieve these targets. Innovate UK\u2019s Circular Plastics Network\u200b comprises a community of 5000-plus individuals who strive to progress plastic production, use and understanding to ensure they fit within a circular economy. One of its focus areas is its \u00a360 million Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging Challenge\u200b, which aims to support developments that can create positive change in the UK\u2019s ability to tackle the 3Rs of plastic packaging waste: reduce, reuse and recycle. \u200b A new way to recycle plastics\u200b Impact Recycling will open its new plastic recycling facility in Durham, UK. The plant is designed to process hard-to-recycle flexible plastics typically used in food packaging. Its tech will turn these plastics into pellets that can be reused and repurposed into new flexible products such as postbags and refuse bags. The tech works by separating post-consumer mixed rigid plastic waste to recover two consistent streams of post-consumer resin (PCR), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), each containing a 98% purity. A process called Baffled Oscillation Separation System (BOSS) organises the waste plastics by spinning them in water, which sorts different materials into those that sink and those that float, depending on their density. Separating plastic materials makes it easier to identify which ones can be recycled and enables businesses to implement the required measures to do so. Speaking on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s goals for the facility, Gueye shared: \u201cWhen open, the facility will have the capacity to take 25,000 tonnes of flexible plastic, which means it has the potential to recycle more than the amount of flexible plastic packaging Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland places on the market.\u201d\u200b Nestl\u00e9\u2019s plastic goals\u200b Plastics are a crucial element of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s business operations. \u201cIt keeps our products safe and fresh on their journey to consumers, enables them to be transported and delivered safely, and offers information about the product itself,\u201d \u200bGueye said, commenting on understanding the critical role packaging plays at Nestl\u00e9. \u201cBut we also recognise the urgent need to address the environmental impact of packaging waste, particularly plastics,\u201d \u200bGueye added. Nestl\u00e9 has implemented a process to collect packaging, such as KitKat wrappers, Purina pet food pouches, Rowntree confectionery sharing bags and Nestl\u00e9 Cereal bags from major supermarket collection points and onto recycling. \u201cEvery action we take has an impact on making a difference to how packaging is recycled and giving it a second life,\u201d\u200b Gueye said. \u201cSupporting innovative technologies like Impact Recycling is just one of the many steps we are taking on our journey to ensure our packaging doesn\u2019t end up as waste,\u201d\u200b Gueye added. Nestl\u00e9 has adopted a five-pillar strategy across three main areas as part of its waste reduction strategy. Firstly, it aims to create less packaging by reducing plastic or using virgin plastics. It also focuses on reuse and refill, Gueye said, rather than disposable packaging and strives to create better packaging by using alternative materials to facilitate recycling. In addition, it is working to develop better recycling systems and help to rethink behaviours internally and with partners and consumers. \u201cIn the UK and Ireland, our efforts continue at pace to ensure as close to 100% of our packaging is designed for recycling by 2025, and we continue to work towards all of our packaging being recyclable or reusable,\u201d \u200bsaid Gueye.","filter_flag":1}

According to the firm, these initiatives have been an important part of its strategy to find \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 solutions for sustainable packaging and other impactful climate actions, with a lot of innovation from here being cultivated in the start-up scene. \u201cOur engagement with all finalists of the Greenhouse Accelerator Programme signifies a vital step in PepsiCo's commitment to net zero and responsible growth,\u201d\u200b PepsiCo APAC CEO Wern Yuen Tan told us. \u201c[This is a valuable means to] catalyse the ecosystem, by supporting entrepreneurs in addressing our shared sustainability challenges and inspiring the next generation of business leaders to drive meaningful change.\"\u200b The PepsiCo APAC Greenhouse Accelerator\u200b Programme ran since June this year, the first the brand has held in the APAC region. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology (CCUS) firm Powered Carbon was announced as the winner in October, defeating nine other finallists from actoss China, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore to win the US$100,000 prize. All finalists were mentored by PepsiCo's industry experts over a four-month mentorship and given a US$20,000 grant to refine their business models, fortify market strategies and enhancing potential impact. \u201cPowered Carbon\u2019s groundbreaking technology can utilise carbon dioxide to cultivate fungi for eco-friendly fertiliser production that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fertilisers,\u201d\u200b he said. \u201cThis is a component [very relevant to PepsiCo\u2019s supply chain] and as an example of how we are working with these entrepreneurs, their eco-friendly products are being tested on the cultivation of potatoes in PepsiCo\u2019s Shandong farm in China.\u200b \u201cPilot results are expected to be revealed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\u201d\u200b Potatoes are a crucial food item in PepsiCo\u2019s supply chain, with much of this going to the production of the firm\u2019s Lay\u2019s branded potato chips amongst others.

Now, two years later the rice-to-chocolate major has outlined a net zero roadmap, including an ambition to halve emissions \u2013 from a 2015 baseline \u2013 by 2030. Mars is pulling many levers to achieve its net zero goal, including transitioning to renewable energy, eliminating deforestation from its supply chains, increasing climate smart agriculture initiatives, and improving logistics. The other tool in Mars\u2019 toolbox is ingredient innovation and product reformulation. The company is developing new ingredients with lower greenhouse gas (GHG)-footprints for snacks and human food dishes, as well as alternative proteins for pet food. Addressing a major culprit: agriculture\u200b Mars, which boasts household name brands Ben\u2019s Original, Twix, and Mars bar in its portfolio, has a current carbon footprint of 30.3mt CO2e. In other words, the company emits around the same amount of GHG as a country the size of Finland. Thirty-eight percent of the company\u2019s emissions come from agriculture, including its food ingredients. Other emissions are associated with land use change (27%), retail (11%), logistics (10%), packaging (5%), and direct operations (4%). Not only is agriculture responsible for a majority of Mars\u2019 emissions, but it is the most challenging to reduce. The company has made progress since 2015, which it attributes to a combination of recipe changes as well as early results from work in some crop supply chains. Thirty-eight percent of the company\u2019s emissions come from agriculture, including its food ingredients. GettyImages\/Eliot76 To further lower emissions associated with agriculture, Mars is looking to optimise sourcing, process and distribution, and formulation. While changing product formulation can be challenging because there are numerous restraints \u2013 ranging from consumer perception to regulatory standards and nutritional requirements \u2013 the company sees opportunity to optimise and develop novel ingredients, as well as production practices, to further lower GHGs. It is estimated such actions could reduce emissions by 0.7mt CO2e. Tapping a potential \u2018game-changer\u2019 ingredient\u200b So what kind of innovations is Mars leveraging to reduce its emissions? According to Janet Dawson, VP of Science and Technology at Mars Snacking, the company\u2019s Ingredient Science team is committed to \u2018pioneering a new era of sustainable ingredients\u2019. \u201cOur latest breakthrough, developed in partnership with UC Davis, is a potential game-changer that could make allulose, a natural sugar substitute, more affordable and accessible though precise fermentation,\u201d \u200bshe told FoodNavigator. Mars funded the research, which saw the Mars Advanced Research Institute team up with UC Davis scientists to work on the sugar alternative allulose, otherwise known as D-psicose. In terms of flavour profile, allulose boasts close to 70% of the sweet taste of sucrose, yet is minimally metabolised by the body. This means that consumers can eat sweet treats with a reduced calorie intake. Further, the sugar substitute has an \u2018imperceptible\u2019 effect on blood glucose and insulin levels. Allulose is naturally occurring, but the researchers discovered a new way of producing it in a lab. By activating a natural process in a microorganism, the scientists were able to develop a method of high-yield and high-purity production through precise fermentation. Specifically, they found an industrial microorganism that has the enzymes to make allulose. The researchers were able to edit the organism\u2019s metabolism to get the cells to convert glucose into allulose, so that when they were fed glucose, allulose was produced with a \u2018noteworthy\u2019 concentration, a yield of more than 60%, and purity of over 95%. \u201cAllulose is a great alternative to sugar, but we have not had a cost-effective way to manufacture it,\u201d \u200bsaid Shota Atsumi, professor of chemistry at UC Davis and corresponding author on the paper published in Science of Food\u200b. \u201cOur new method is efficient, economically feasible and could be scaled up for commercial production.\u201d\u200b This technological innovation is just one example of how Mars is \u2018constantly pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible\u2019, said Dawson. Using allulose instead of sugar is not currently an option for Mars in Europe, where the sugar substitute is considered a novel food and as such, requires pre-market. Naturally occurring allulose is currently undergoing safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Looking to start-up innovation\u200b In the US, Mars recently conducted a trial launch of CO2COA using Perfect Day\u2019s precision fermentation-derived dairy protein. Image credit: Mars Inc. At the same time, Mars is looking to third-party ingredient suppliers to develop new products. In the US, Mars recently conducted a trial launch of CO2COA using Perfect Day\u2019s precision fermentation-derived dairy protein. Perfect Day is making whey, casein, and dairy fats \u2013 without the cow. To date, only its whey protein beta-lactoglobulin is on the market. To make animal-free whey, the start-up uses a genetically engineered strain of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma Reesi\u200b and feeds it with a broth made from water, nutrients and sugar in a fermenter tank. The fungus then excretes the dairy protein for Perfect Day to harvest. A recent lifecycle assessment found that Perfect Day\u2019s precision fermentation process uses up to 99% less water and produces up to 97% fewer GHG emissions compared to traditional production methods. Lactose-free milk chocolate brand CO2COA was made with Rainforest Alliance certified cocoa and sold in 83% fibre-based packaging. According to Dawson, Perfect Day\u2019s animal-free protein delivered a \u2018comparable chocolate experience that consumers \u2018really liked\u2019. Encouraging sustainable practices within current supply chains\u200b While working with novel sustainable ingredients will play a \u2018critical\u2019 role in delivering on Mars\u2019 net zero commitment, Dawson stressed that this work is being conducted at the same time as efforts to make Mars\u2019 current stable of ingredients more sustainable. \u201cOur work on dairy is this ethos in action,\u201d \u200bshe told this publication. \u201cWe\u2019re working on reducing the footprint of our dairy supply by 50% by 2023 through a number of on-farm interventions in partnership with our top suppliers.\u201d\u200b Indeed Mars is a member of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative\u2019s (SAI) Sustainable Dairy Partnership, which aims to promote and communicate continuous improvement in dairy sustainability. The B2B programme targets commercial relationships between dairy buyers and processors. The latter is required to report on their progress and impacts, to help dairy buyers understand sustainability progress within the supply chain. Efforts to make Mars Inc. current stable of ingredients more sustainable are underway. GettyImages\/Johnny Greig Mars is also a member of SAI\u2019s Dairy Working Group, which helps ensure the company is sourcing dairy from suppliers with advanced sustainable farming practices that protect animal welfare, the environment and human rights. How does M&A impact Mars\u2019 net zero ambition?\u200b Mars has active in M&A of late, incorporate a number of new brands into its portfolio of late. In 2020, the confectionery major acquired snacks brand KIND North America, in 2020 it bought fruit brand Tr\u00fc Fr\u00fc, and just last week it was announced Mars would be acquiring UK-based luxury chocolate retailer Hotel Chocolat\u200b. Besides managing the GHGs of businesses Mars operates today, the company acknowledges that climate is an important factor in its inorganic growth strategy. When Mars acquires a business, it also acquires its GHG footprint, all the way back to its baseline year of 2015 and into the future. So when considering an acquisition, Mars will assess the business\u2019 GHG footprint. This includes building into the financial model an estimate of the costs to manage the footprint of the acquired business to align with Mars\u2019 targets. With regards to Hotel Chocolat, the business has already been making progress towards reducing its GHG emissions. The luxury chocolate maker has committed to net zero for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (those within its own direct operations) by 2030, and reductions have been made by switching electricity to renewable sources (75% wind and 25% biomass). Almost all packaging is now sourced closer to home (the UK and EU), instead of being airfreighted in from East Asia, which the company says has led to a \u2018significant\u2019 reduction in emissions. Other steps made to improve the sustainability of its packaging include reducing the amount of packaging where possible, using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified card and paper, and designing packaging to be re-usable.","filter_flag":1}
