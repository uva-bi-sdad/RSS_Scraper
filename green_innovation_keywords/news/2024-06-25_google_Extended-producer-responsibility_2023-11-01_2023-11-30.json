The suit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, is one of the first legal challenges from a state against a major plastic producer. It draws on a 2022 investigation from James\u2019 office in which PepsiCo-branded plastic packaging was found to be by far the most significant contributor to plastic waste clogging the Buffalo River and its tributaries. Out of nearly 2,000 pieces of plastic trash collected at 13 sites along the waterways, PepsiCo products \u2014 which include brands like Aquafina, Cheetos, Gatorade, and Lay\u2019s \u2014 accounted for more than 17 percent of those with identifiable branding. All that plastic litter is breaking down into tiny fragments \u2014 microplastics \u2014 that are winding up in Buffalo\u2019s water supply and the fish that people eat. Some of the chemicals contained in microplastics are carcinogenic, and researchers have raised concerns that the particles could cause reproductive dysfunction and other maladies. \u201cPepsiCo\u2019s irresponsible packaging and marketing endanger Buffalo\u2019s water supply, environment, and public health,\u201d James said in a statement. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The New York lawsuit includes a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d claim and requests that the state\u2019s Supreme Court require PepsiCo to reduce the amount of plastic packaging entering the Buffalo River and remediate pollution that has already occurred. It also invokes consumer protection law: Although PepsiCo has \u201clong been aware\u201d of the environmental and human health risks posed by single-use plastic products, the AG\u2019s office says PepsiCo has obscured these risks in communications to the public \u2014 in part by promoting plastics recycling and the promise of a so-called \u201ccircular economy,\u201d in which plastic products can be endlessly reprocessed rather than eventually turned into waste. New York Attorney General Letitia James Spencer Platt \/ Getty Images One PepsiCo communication cited in the lawsuit says the company\u2019s plastic recycling strategy will \u201ckeep the material in the circular economy.\u201d Most plastics \u2014 including all of PepsiCo\u2019s snack food wrappers \u2014 cannot be recycled, and even the company\u2019s plastic soda bottles can only be turned into a new bottles a few times before they have to be junked. Nationally, only 5 percent of plastics are ever turned into new products. Meanwhile, PepsiCo has repeatedly missed or failed to make progress toward its own targets for plastic reduction and the use of recycled content. Most recently, the company reported an 11 percent increase in virgin plastic use between 2020 and 2022, despite a commitment to reduce virgin plastic by 20 percent by 2030. Between 2018 and 2022, it also reported a decrease in the fraction of its plastic packaging that was reusable, recyclable, or compostable. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How In response to Grist\u2019s request for comment, PepsiCo said it is \u201cserious about plastic reduction and effective recycling.\u201d \u201dThis is a complex issue and requires involvement from a variety of stakeholders, including businesses, municipalities, waste-reduction providers, community leaders, and consumers,\u201d a spokesperson said via email. According to a national waste audit coordinated by the nonprofit Break Free From Plastic Pollution, PepsiCo has been among the top three companies creating the most pieces of plastic litter every year since 2018. Only the Coca-Cola Company has consistently produced more plastic litter. Environmental nonprofits have repeatedly sued PepsiCo and other companies over their use of plastic and claims about recyclability, but these suits have been less common at the state level. Last year, Connecticut\u2019s attorney general filed a truth-in-advertising lawsuit against Reynolds Consumer Products, arguing that the company labeled its Hefty trash bags as recyclable \u201cdespite full knowledge that their bags were incompatible with recycling facilities in Connecticut.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s attorney general filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year, targeting both the Hefty manufacturer and Walmart. Volunteers pick up trash along the Buffalo River in upstate New York. Courtesy of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper Those suits, however, did not invoke public nuisance law \u2014 something that makes the PepsiCo case \u201cnew and very exciting,\u201d according to Bethany Davis Noll, executive director of the State Energy and Environment Impact Center at the NYU School of Law. She could think of only one other ongoing public nuisance lawsuit related to plastic pollution, filed in 2020 by the nonprofit Earth Island Institute against companies including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Public nuisance has played a more prominent role in recent lawsuits filed by attorneys general against manufacturers of PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d which have tainted drinking water supplies worldwide. The New York lawsuit seeks to require PepsiCo to attach a warning label to any single-use plastic products sold in the Buffalo region, conveying plastics\u2019 risks to public health and the environment. It also seeks civil penalties, restitution, and disgorgement of any profits it made through sales in the Buffalo region that were found to have been illegal under New York state\u2019s consumer protection laws. Rachel Karasik, a senior policy associate at the Duke University Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability, said a successful case could spur PepsiCo to invest in reuse systems throughout the Buffalo area. In the absence of a New York state-wide extended producer responsibility law for plastic packaging \u2014 a policy that makes plastic producers financially responsible for the waste they produce \u2014 Karasik also said litigation could yield financing for plastic cleanup and collection activities. Noll hoped the New York attorney general\u2019s case would inspire more legal challenges elsewhere. Plastic pollution is \u201cprevalent all around the country,\u201d she told Grist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get companies to stop lying about how this stuff is recyclable.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Ukraine: Recyclable Grain Bags \u2013 This project aims to support small and medium-sized farms and local industry by introducing a recyclable grain bag (sleeve) storage technology. With this technology, farmers impacted by the destruction of agricultural equipment have an opportunity to store their harvest in an easy and accessible way and preserve it until the point of usage or export, which helps prevent food waste. Dow is working with the Ukrainian Agrarian Council NGO and local business partners to simultaneously integrate a recycling concept for the bags to help close the loop and reduce plastic waste. United States: Taking Care of our Home \u2013 This project assesses the current recycling landscape and identifies strategies to improve recycling rates in key U.S. Gulf Coast communities where Dow operates. By uniting with our NGO partner, The Recycling Partnership, our goal is to boost residential and commercial recycling rates in these communities, which contain most of Dow\u2019s manufacturing footprint in North America. Since launching in 2016, the Impact Fund has supported 58 projects in 22 countries totaling nearly $12 million in investments. To date, the Fund\u2019s projects have achieved the following outcomes: >2,000 jobs created jobs created >13,400 MT materials recycled materials recycled >9,500 MT of plastic diverted from a landfill or environment of plastic diverted from a landfill or environment 46,000 acres of land protected Dow employees worldwide nominate potential projects, and a diverse committee representing business and functional leadership across the Company selects the winners.

In 2010, the organ\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adtion assessed the envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal impact of sub\u00adsti\u00adtut\u00ading end-of-life tyres for prod\u00aducts from dif\u00adfer\u00adent sec\u00adtors4. The ben\u00ade\u00adfits are clear for Astro\u00adturf, mould\u00aded objects and cement works, but min\u00adi\u00admal for reten\u00adtion basins. A num\u00adber of envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal indi\u00adca\u00adtors exist. For exam\u00adple, sub\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion for Astro\u00adturf avoids the emis\u00adsion of 3 tonnes of CO 2 equiv\u00ada\u00adlent for each tonne of used tyres recov\u00adered. The process also uses 15 m3 less water. Mate\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal recov\u00adery from used tyres is the pre\u00adferred method of recov\u00adery under the Envi\u00adron\u00adment Code5, after re-use. How\u00adev\u00ader, most end-of-life tyres are recov\u00adered in the form of ener\u00adgy. \u201cThis sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion is spe\u00adcif\u00adic to France; we don\u2019t see the same trends in oth\u00ader Euro\u00adpean coun\u00adtries,\u201d explains Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cBut it\u2019s a one-off sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion and linked to recent Euro\u00adpean reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions \u2013 aimed at ban\u00adning the incor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtion of microplas\u00adtics and the use of rub\u00adber gran\u00adu\u00adlates in syn\u00adthet\u00adic sports pitch\u00ades.\u201d Anoth\u00ader obsta\u00adcle to recy\u00adcling is the pos\u00adsi\u00adble out\u00adlets. \u201cWe need to recov\u00ader used tyres in one way or anoth\u00ader, and the ener\u00adgy recov\u00adery require\u00adments of cement works mean that they can absorb large vol\u00adumes. We need to cre\u00adate ways of recov\u00ader\u00ading mate\u00adri\u00adals that require large vol\u00adumes, and there\u00adfore with suf\u00adfi\u00adcient added val\u00adue.\u201d says Ludovic Moulin. Tougher reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions could, how\u00adev\u00ader, push the indus\u00adtry to increase the pro\u00adpor\u00adtion of end-of-life tyres recy\u00adcled. \u201cIn 2020, the anti-waste law imposed a new tight\u00aden\u00ading-up on the sec\u00adtor: com\u00adpa\u00adnies must be accred\u00adit\u00aded,\u201d explains Thomas Grandin. This require\u00adment will be laid down in a decree and an order6 in 2023, set\u00adting out the spec\u00adi\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtions for the sector\u2019s eco-organ\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adtions. These impose recy\u00adcling tar\u00adgets on the tyres col\u00adlect\u00aded: from 40% in 2024 to 42% in 2028 of the quan\u00adti\u00adties of waste col\u00adlect\u00aded. \u201cWe have also not\u00aded that social accep\u00adtance is a bar\u00adri\u00ader, but there is no tech\u00adni\u00adcal bar\u00adri\u00ader to recy\u00adcling,\u201d asserts Jean-Philippe Faure. Aiming for zero waste thanks to pyrolysis Tyres are made up of over 200 dif\u00adfer\u00adent mate\u00adri\u00adals. But ful\u00adly devel\u00adoped sep\u00ada\u00adra\u00adtion process\u00ades do exist. The aim is to iso\u00adlate the dif\u00adfer\u00adent com\u00adpo\u00adnents to offer prod\u00aducts with a high added val\u00adue. \u201cFor some years now, the trend has been towards the devel\u00adop\u00adment of pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis,\u201d points out Ludovic Moulin. By heat\u00ading the tyre to a very high tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture and in the absence of oxy\u00adgen, it is pos\u00adsi\u00adble to recov\u00ader a num\u00adber of prod\u00aducts: car\u00adbon black, pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis oil, steel-met\u00adal rein\u00adforce\u00adments, gas, tex\u00adtiles, etc. Although still mar\u00adgin\u00adal in many coun\u00adtries, this process is the main way of recov\u00ader\u00ading end-of-life tyres in Chi\u00adna, Thai\u00adland, Indone\u00adsia and Mex\u00adi\u00adco, \u201cbecause of insuf\u00adfi\u00adcient or non-exis\u00adtent envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal con\u00adstraints,\u201d explains Ludovic Moulin. \u201cBetween the health cri\u00adsis and fears about raw mate\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal sup\u00adplies, the cir\u00adcu\u00adlar econ\u00ado\u00admy is gain\u00ading momen\u00adtum and the mar\u00adket is now open\u00ading up to these new prod\u00aducts,\u201d com\u00adments Thomas Grandin. In Europe, Miche\u00adlin has announced the cre\u00adation of the first pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis site with Swedish start-up Envi\u00adro, which is set to han\u00addle 1 mil\u00adlion tonnes of used tyres by 2030. \u201cOth\u00ader projects are under\u00adway in Ger\u00admany (Pyrum Inno\u00adva\u00adtions), Spain (L4T and Green\u00adval Tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies) and the UK (Bold\u00ader Indus\u00adtries),\u201d adds Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cThis approach is set to take off in the next few years.\u201d Fund\u00aded by the Euro\u00adpean Union and coor\u00addi\u00adnat\u00aded by Miche\u00adlin, the Black Cycle project7 aims to demon\u00adstrate the via\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty of the cir\u00adcu\u00adlar econ\u00ado\u00admy for pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis. The con\u00adsor\u00adtium aims to opti\u00admise the pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis process. The aim? Zero waste. Both the car\u00adbon black and the pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis oil \u2013 trans\u00adformed into car\u00adbon black \u2013 recov\u00adered will be entire\u00adly reused to man\u00adu\u00adfac\u00adture new tyres. Oth\u00ader projects aim to explore new ways of recov\u00ader\u00ading used tyres. \u201cPub\u00adlic works are the most promis\u00ading sec\u00adtor for the future,\u201d says Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cFor exam\u00adple, there is a need for new types of back\u00adfill, capa\u00adble of absorb\u00ading shock and being light and flex\u00adi\u00adble.\u201d Recy\u00adcled tyres could even be incor\u00adpo\u00adrat\u00aded into pave\u00adments using a mix\u00adture of recy\u00adcled con\u00adcrete and rub\u00adber aggre\u00adgates8.

This comes after feedback, received during consultation on the legislation, to allow producers managing packaging in a closed-loop system to exclude this material from their household disposal fees obligations. In response, the Government has said it will consider a \u2018narrow expansion\u2019 to the offsetting provisions, to assist producers who have established processes to recover and recycle material within their own business operations, where this is aligned with the environmental objectives of extended producer responsibility (EPR). This proposal will potentially amend provision in the draft regulations that enables producers to offset some of their household disposal fees obligations. As it currently stands, this will be permitted in specific circumstances, such as when the material is not collected at kerbside by more than 75 per cent of local authorities or when the packaging items are intended for reuse or refilling. Defra is calling on businesses \u2013 while welcoming other relevant stakeholders \u2013 to complete a survey to assist it on how it may be able to accommodate closed-loop recycling within the EPR framework. It is also hosting a stakeholder workshop on 20 November to discuss the process in greater detail. What is closed-loop recycling? A closed-loop recycling system refers to one in which producers collect their own waste \u2013 in this instance packaging \u2013 before using recyclate to manufacture another product within the same product category. A significant advantage of closed-loop recycling is that it allows a continuous flow of resources \u2013 new products are manufactured with recycled content, and used, before being recycled into new products again \u2013 reducing the strain on natural resources and driving the transition towards the circular economy. There have been concerns that the incoming EPR regulations will disincentive investments into closed-loop recycling systems. Under the regulations, companies have voiced fears that despite investing in a closed-loop system, they will be taxed as if their products are entering the waste system.","filter_flag":1}

The country\u2019s Environment Ministers met in Adelaide and agreed to develop ambitious national targets to protect nature, critical next steps to transition Australia to a circular economy, and practical on-ground actions to boost conservation. The Ministers agreed that Federal Government will step up as the new regulator of packaging standards, and will mandate how packaging is designed, will set minimum recycled content requirements, and prohibit harmful chemicals being used. \u201cAustralia\u2019s new Federal national packaging laws will provide regulatory certainty and consistency, and make businesses take responsibility for the 6.7 million tonnes of packaging they place on the Australian market,\u201d the Ministers\u2019 stated in their communique. \u201cStrengthened regulation will drive investment, minimise waste and support circular economy outcomes, industries and jobs. \u201cBetter packaging design makes it easier to reduce waste and to reuse, recycle or compost packaging waste. Creating demand for recycled content will also increase recycling rates.\u201d The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) was first to respond to PKN following the announcement last Friday. Chris Foley, APCO CEO, said: \u201cThis announcement by Environment Ministers is exactly what APCO and our members have been seeking: a strong regulatory framework that will underpin the transition to a circular economy for packaging in Australia. Two measures specified by Ministers \u2013 mandatory design standards and recycled content requirements \u2013 will effectively bookend the system and drive increased collection and recycling. APCO\u2019s members identified these measures as key in during the national consultation roadshow APCO conducted in August this year.\u201d Foley told PKN that APCO\u2019s attention \u2013 and that of policy makers \u2013 will now turn to the all-important detail that will give effect to the Ministers\u2019 announcement and create the business confidence and investment certainty needed. Important questions to consider, he said, will include: How prescriptive will the design standards be and how quickly will they seek to drive change? What data is needed and how will it be collected? What role will extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes play? \u201cBuilding on the consultation we have conducted with our members over the past 12 months, APCO will undertake another major round of consultation with members in the first half of 2024. In the meantime, we will maintain regular communication with policy makers and keep our members informed of progress,\u201d Foley said. The Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) said that the announcement is fundamental for a closed loop on packaging, particularly soft plastics in Australia, and says for a true circular economy to occur, all sections of the supply chain need to collaborate and move forward together.\u201d \u201cAny increase in the use of recycled content relies on sufficient collection and processing of that material here in Australia. Mandatory design standards are essential for a circular economy, but importantly require a recycling system to process the material Australians collect at home,\u201d a Council spokesperson said. \u201cTraceability of recycling material will provide confidence for Australians to recycle, brands the confidence to procure recycled content, and the broader supply chain the confidence to invest in recycling infrastructure, creating local jobs. \u201cA circular economy for soft plastics is a huge opportunity for Australia economically and environmentally. We look forward to being part of the solution and continuing to collaborate with the entire supply chain to reduce landfill, create jobs and to close the loop on soft plastics.\u201d Rigid plastic packaging manufacturer Pact Group has welcomed the regulatory reforms for packaging, with CEO and managing director, Sanjay Dayal, saying that implementing strict design standards and mandating minimum recycled content quotas for all packaging will \u201cturbo-charge\u201d Australia\u2019s circular economy, particularly for plastics. \u201cPlastic packaging that is designed effectively, that is recyclable and recycled properly can stay in the circular economy almost indefinitely,\u201d Dayal said. \u201cThe transition to more sustainable packaging has progressed slowly in Australia to date because we have been relying on voluntary targets and the goodwill of industry leaders. These regulatory reforms will bring about a step change in the packaging industry and help divert huge volumes of plastic waste from landfill, improve our environment, and create more jobs in Australia\u2019s circular economy. \"Better collection and sorting of waste, along with improved labelling requirements for packaging would help increase the quantity and quality of available recyclable material. \u201cAs an integrated plastic recycling and packaging manufacturer, Pact stands ready to embrace the reforms and help our customers transition to more sustainable packaging options.\u201d The decision to move from voluntary to mandating national packaging targets have also been welcomed by the Boomerang Alliance, who said it awaits the next stage in a full-scale collection and reprocessing scheme and less plastic in the environment. \u201cThis is the first step in a revolution in how Australia handles packaging waste and pollution,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Angel, director of Boomerang Alliance. \u201cThere also needs to be a focus on reducing the amount of plastic, growing reuse, and industry funding of the circular economy engine. It\u2019s their responsibility and I\u2019m sure consumers want far less environmental damage from packaging and plastic pollution. \u2018\u2019Voluntary approaches by the sector over the last two decades have failed and the Boomerang Alliance has submitted a best practice scheme that will make a real difference.\u2019\u2019 Ministers have endorsed a national traceability framework, which they said will be key to driving the reuse of recovered plastics, glass and other materials into new products. Ministers also agreed on a framework that will accelerate product stewardship by better coordinating work across governments, including WA leading on tyres and NSW leading on solvents. According to the Ministers, product stewardship schemes will play a key role in holding producers accountable for managing their waste and driving circularity. However, they said that these schemes are not open-ended, and where industry does not respond sufficiently, government will regulate.","filter_flag":1}

Malaysia has reportedly announced the aspiration to achieve a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target as early as 2050 and has joined the 2021 Global Methane Pledge that aims to reduce global methane emission by at least 30% from 2020 levels. For individuals, we have a responsibility to be sustainable in our daily consumption but for larger scale efforts, one of the keys in reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions is through solid waste management solutions. It is also more urgent than ever as our landfills are overwhelmed. According to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida), by 2022, the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) is expected to rise to 14 million metric tonnes annually, enough to fill the Petronas Twin Towers every week. As the population grows, the amount of commercial and domestic waste will also rise. This calls for a more efficient and environmentally friendly way to manage waste. This is where Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Malakoff) steps in. After undergoing a corporate rebranding exercise, the company has emerged as an important organisation that plays a pivotal role in the country\u2019s environmental agenda. With a tagline \u201cEnhancing Life, Enriching Communities\u201d, Malakoff has identified three business pillars: Malakoff Green Solutions, Malakoff Environmental Solutions and Malakoff Energy. Through its Malakoff Environmental Solutions pillar, Malakoff is the only energy company that provides solid waste management and public cleansing, infrastructure cleansing and waste solutions, integrated facility management, recycling, marine and hazardous waste solutions, water desalination and waste-to-energy in the country. The pillar is divided into three main segments: concession (solid waste management and public cleansing) which is managed by Alam Flora Sdn Bhd (Alam Flora), a wholly owned subsidiary of Malakoff; non-concession (including infrastructure cleansing and waste solutions) and WTE, managed by Alam Flora Environmental Solutions (AFES), a member of the Malakoff Group. Reducing Waste with Minimal Impact on the Environment Alam Flora is one of the largest concession holders of Malaysia\u2019s national solid waste management and public cleansing privatisation project. The company provides comprehensive waste management services to several concession areas in Peninsular Malaysia, among them are Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Pahang. Operating within the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act of 2007, Alam Flora adopted various processes in overseeing the operations of collection, discarding and maintenance that are compliant with local and international standards. Part of the company\u2019s bigger agenda is to increase recycling capacity in line with national targets. One way that they achieve this is through Fasiliti Inovasi Kitar Semula (FIKS) in Putrajaya, a one-stop centre for the public to learn about recycling processes and waste management. Fasiliti Inovasi Kitar Semula (FIKS) in Putrajaya FIKS is the first-ever waste management and recycling education centre in Malaysia, with a recycling knowledge hub, mini library, recycling and buy-back centre and 3R boutique \u2013 which collects gently used clothing to be sold at reasonable prices with the proceeds going to charity. Besides that, Integrated Recycling Facility (IRF) is also available at the centre, where all the recyclable materials are sorted and processed to end-user manufacturers to be reprocessed into secondary raw material and new products. Apart from FIKS, AFES has also launched its Recovery Initiative Sustainable Eco-Facility (RISE Kuala Lumpur) on 15 September this year, in Gombak, Selangor to lead the way in implementing the circular economy model and commit to sustainability. With advanced facilities and equipped with a semi-auto sorting machine, the facility receives different types of recyclable wastes from municipal solid waste, which will be repurposed to reduce its impact on the environment. Supporting Sustainable Waste Management with Policies Malakoff, through its subsidiaries, is also pushing for the government to introduce certain policies to have greater impact in its recycling and waste reduction efforts. Policies and systems such as Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) have been introduced in other countries including Japan and other European countries but have yet to be introduced in Malaysia. EPR is a policy in which producers are held responsible for the products they manufacture once those products are no longer useful to consumers. On the other hand, PPP is implemented to ensure that the party responsible for producing pollution pays for the damage inflicted on the natural environment. Other solutions include landfill tax (paid in addition to normal landfill rates), and the Pay-As-You-Throw (PAYT) system treats trash services like other utilities, where households pay a variable rate based on the amount of waste they generate, implemented through a flat fee for each garbage bag used. Ultimately, the enactment of any policies or acts that reduce waste consumption, will reduce waste generation and from being sent to the landfills and most importantly, be more sustainable in the long term. Having taken on the role, Alam Flora is steadfast in ensuring wastes are managed in a responsible manner. No easy feat! Enriching Communities In supporting one of the nation\u2019s circular economy roadmaps, Malaysia Plastic Sustainability Roadmap 2021 \u2013 2030, Alam Flora and AFES have implemented ingenious solutions in waste management. Alam Flora has introduced 3R on Wheels which aims to create public awareness of recycling and, offering mobility for the public to take part in recycling activities either at public events or residential areas. Meanwhile, the company has partnered with Nestle Malaysia through its subsidiary AFES to launch a kerbside programme in 15 townships in Greater Kuala Lumpur. This is to recover post-consumer packaging in one hand, and in the other, to enhance consumer awareness of how to recycle the packaging effectively. They have also deployed its first on site Port Reception Facilities (PRF) in Malaysia to deal with marine waste from ship liners berthing at Northport. Clearly, the group is knee-deep in solving the country\u2019s waste matters in an efficient and sustainable manner with its end-to-end solutions. Aside from the reduction of waste, Malakoff is also exploring the Waste-to-Energy (WTE) sector, as part of its sustainable practices. WTE technology involves turning waste materials, particularly non-recyclable and biodegradable waste, into usable heat, electricity, or fuel. This reduces waste while offering economic and environmental benefits. WTE minimises the release of methane into the atmosphere, which can be fatal at high levels as it can replace oxygen and cause asphyxiation. Moving Forward with Sustainability in Mind Through Malakoff Environmental Solutions business pillar, Malakoff plans to venture into local projects and expansion opportunities abroad, at the back of its commitment to maintain environmental sustainability and reducing carbon emission of its operation. With its vast experience in waste management and environmental solutions, the company is looking to provide waste solutions to more businesses including commercial organisations and ports. In October this year, Malakoff had proposed to acquire a 49% stake in a solid waste management company, E-Idaman Sdn Bhd to expand its waste management and environmental portfolio in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia and establish a stronger foothold in this evolving environmental business landscape. The company is also planning to expand its services to new concession areas within Malaysia such as Labuan, Kelantan and Terengganu. In addition to championing the municipal solid waste market through the expansion of business areas, there are several opportunities for Malakoff to grow into integrated hazardous waste operations which include the collection, treatment and disposal of medical, industrial and construction waste. Medical hazardous waste, e-waste and construction waste are also expected to grow at a rate of 10%, 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, providing Malakoff with growth opportunities in the non-concession segment. A sustainably- driven company, Malakoff is committed to enhancing lives and enriching communities. Malakoff aspires and works towards driving change to realise the country\u2019s ambitions of carbon neutrality and a circular economy by offering extensive skills in waste management and environmental solutions for a healthier and cleaner future for Malaysians.","filter_flag":1}
