Danish startup Algiecel announced that its Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) application has been approved and that funding of DKK 18 million (USD 2.6 million) has been granted. The other project partners are Novozymes, DTU Chemical Engineering, Knowledge Hub Zealand and Power to Climate Change. The purpose of this EUDP project is to demonstrate that even relatively small amounts of CO 2 from industrial sites can feasibly be converted to and utilized as valuable downstream B2B bio-based products. In this case, CO 2 from Novozymes will be collected and applied in the Algiecel photobioreactor (PBR), and once the algae-based biomass is harvested, it will be demonstrated that water and nutrients can be reused, and the biomass can be sent off for further processing. Knowledge Hub Zealand will manage the project, and the Technical University of Denmark will secure that the entire techno-economic part of the technology will be well-documented. Algiecel\u2019s solution is targeting small and mid-sized industries considered too small for large P2X projects. The utilization of CO 2 will efficiently take place through photosynthesizing microalgae while generating biomass and bio-oil for industries such as cosmetics, food, aquaculture feed, biofertilizer and bioplastics. Once finalized, the project intends to demonstrate how future biogas and fermentation clients of the Algiecel carbon utilization as a service technology can valorize their CO 2 emissions to the benefit of everybody in the value chain. \u201cReceiving such a significant grant from EUDP and having such well-renowned partners included in the project is a very important stamp of approval for our technology and business offering. We would like to become known for our ability to apply biosolutions to deliver decarbonization and microalgae-based sustainable low-carbon low-footprint products to the market. This demonstration project allows us to tell the tale and demonstrate our ability to deliver on our vision and ambitions,\u201d said CEO and founder of Algiecel, Henrik Busch-Larsen. \u201cPartnering up with Algiecel to demonstrate the CO 2 removal technology is one of our strategic sustainability bets. This can potentially enable Novozymes to capture CO 2 from our processes that would otherwise be hard to capture since it is considered too small for large P2X projects. This is a part of Novozymes\u2019 ambitious journey to reduce CO 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and become CO 2 -neutral by 2050. There is a good match between Algiecel and Novozymes, both working on developing the innovative biotech solutions the world needs. Novozymes\u2019 Kalundborg site is a good location for demonstrating CO 2 capture by algae processes, having nutrient and CO 2 streams available. During the demonstration, it will be explored whether CO 2 capture can be done by combining Algiecel\u2019s technology with Saipem\u2019s and Novozymes\u2019 enzymatic CO 2 technology for certain types of CO 2 emissions,\u201d Flemming Funch, VP for Engineering, Sourcing and Facility Services at Novozymes, explained. After having successfully initiated operations of its pilot plant in 2022, Algiecel recently raised funds to move from pilot operations to completing the full-scale design as well as initiating algae-product application trials.","filter_flag":1}

By implementing sustainable practices, companies can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future while driving innovation and strengthening their brand. Embrace green computing today for a brighter tomorrow! What Is Green Computing? Green computing, sometimes called \u201csustainable IT,\u201d refers to practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint of either individuals or businesses. In today\u2019s modern business climate, green computing is a vital consideration. Achieving \u201cnet zero\u201d (or reducing greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible) has become a priority for most organizations today. Businesses and individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by implementing green computing practices. IBM defines green computing as \u201cthe design, manufacture, use, and disposal of computers, chips, other technology components, and peripherals in a way that limits the harmful impact on the environment, including reducing carbon emissions and the energy consumed by manufacturers, data centers and end-users.\u201d While the main objective of green IT practices is reducing energy consumption, businesses must be aware of how green computing can also increase their bottom line. Organizations, including SMBs, can implement changes to increase energy efficiency and lower energy consumption. However, green computing is ideal for enterprise firms as part of an organization\u2019s overall environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy and journey. Implementing a sustainable strategy can lessen the environmental impact of a business while contributing to overall growth over time. See More: The Impact of ESG Regulations Why Green Computing Is an Essential Part of Sustainability The information and communications technology (ICT) sector is responsible for 2% or more of global greenhouse emissions. According to a study in Patterns, \u201cpeer-reviewed studies estimate ICT\u2019s current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%\u20132.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could be between 2.1% and 3.9%.\u201d The ICT sector\u2019s impact on the environment has worsened in recent years. The rise in cloud computing, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and the explosion of smartphones and other mobile devices contribute to the increase. Data centers are responsible for over 3% of all annual energy consumption. See More: 4 Ways to Ensure Energy Efficiency in Data Centers Key Business Benefits From Green Computing Practices Green computing aims to reduce environmental impact while encouraging the widespread use of more sustainable technologies. Still, there are additional benefits to employing sustainable methods that can lead to steady business growth and profitability. By taking a proactive and achievable approach to sustainable IT, businesses can work toward achieving greater environmental stewardship. Five top benefits of implementing a green IT strategy include the following: Lowering energy costs: Efforts to reduce electricity can lower energy costs for businesses. Changes such as using more energy-efficient devices or alternative energy sources can contribute to lower electricity on a large scale if widely adopted. Gaining a competitive advantage : Pursuing sustainability goals can lead to more profitability and interest from potential investors. A recent Gartner survey Opens a new window revealed ESG is now a top priority for CEOs and CIOs. In contrast, 74% of CEOs agree that increasing ESG efforts will attract more investors expecting firms to do more for the environment. Strengthening your brand: Building a track record of tangible sustainability practices is key to a stronger brand in today\u2019s marketplace. Customers reward sustainable companies with loyalty and repeat business and often prefer ESG-backed products and services. Attracting and retaining talent: Potential employees are interested in working for companies with demonstrated sustainability practices \u2013 especially Gen Z job seekers. A recent KPMG survey Opens a new window revealed that one in three Gen Z respondents \u201csaid they had turned down a job because the company\u2019s ESG commitments were not in line with their values.\u201d Gen Z employees are also willing to leave a company if they don\u2019t follow through with their ESG commitments. Increasing innovation: Green computing practices can drive sustainable innovation, which refers to developing new products, services, processes, and methods that are both sustainable and profitable. Technology organizations can deliver better client experiences that benefit the environment through green computing. Green Computing Techniques for Various IT Functions Green computing techniques can mitigate some of the environmental impacts of the computing industry. These techniques encompass different areas of the IT process and involve several participants. Generally, green IT practices can be applied in the following areas: Design and manufacturing of computer chips, hardware, components, and devices. This includes designing energy-efficient computers and systems. Green disposal of hardware and devices. The implementation of higher efficiency energy practices in the operation of data centers. Employing sustainable practices in computing and software engineering. Some practices are focused on ways to reduce the energy consumption of data centers, such as implementing higher efficiency sustainable cooling technologies. Organizations can also invest in more energy-efficient computer systems with extended life cycles. Other methods for sustainable computing include extending the life cycle of hardware and devices. Edge computing, a type of distributed storage framework, is one technique that can lower energy use in data centers by lowering network traffic. Developers and software engineers can explore various ways to incorporate green computing methods. Green coding, a concept that involves writing leaner and less wasteful lines of code, can reduce the energy consumption of processing. Programming methods can also be modified to utilize devices and the hardware available better. It is important to fully utilize the device\u2019s processing capabilities with clean, native code concepts (embedded NEON, ARM64, and Intel SIMD). This approach can improve the overall collaborative experience while reducing the carbon footprint and delivering more engaging live experiences even on older, less capable devices. Becoming Energy-efficient Energy efficiency can improve overall by utilizing the GPU and CPU. Originating with gaming software development, the GPU approach means that computing is offloaded to the graphics processor unit rather than relying solely on the CPU and main memory. This method lowers the number of cycles needed to complete the processes, thus saving energy. This approach effectively lowers the carbon footprint of devices because they achieve better utilization rates. The potential to reduce the impact of computing on the environment will require a collaborative effort across industries. However, individual businesses can progress by finding ways to use technology sustainably throughout their organization.

Today, its application goes beyond manufacturing, impacting transactional processes from healthcare services to software design. The TPS is, in fact, a multidisciplinary science that can be taught and applied more widely\u2014not just to business haphazardly, but systematically to the broader aspects of our economies. I would argue that it offers solutions to the pervasive financial, socioeconomic and environmental contradictions in today\u2019s society. Unfortunately, its technical and managerial innovations are inadequately understood and applied. Many leaders do not clearly grasp the full scope of benefits that TPS offers. Instead, they choose elements of it and apply them with limited financial, social and economic effects. By 1938, Toyota \u201cinversed\u201d industrial thinking amid the mass production system boom. It was decades ahead of the need to create a production system that is better adapted to a diversified economy of variety than a uniform economy of scale. And, it remains relevant today. Before the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting parts shortages, Toyota had the foresight to safeguard against shortages of vehicle computer chips. Doing so is much easier and less expensive when manufacturers eliminate having to supply from inventory. To make a simple analogy, when you are not used to eating sugar, a little of it goes a long way. In 1998, Fujio Cho, then president of Toyota, announced the North American development of the new Toyota Sequoia SUV to compete against the best-selling Ford Explorer. Sales of SUVs were booming, gas was cheap, and global warming was not yet part of the public zeitgeist. Yet, one of Cho\u2019s proudest moments was his championing of the launch of the first hybrid vehicle in Japan, the Toyota Prius. Today, the production of Toyota hybrid, electric, and hydrogen engines continues to align with the global need for clean energy. As Toyota continues to meet the business, social and economic needs of our changing world, it seems evident that something more is at work with TPS than just making cars. The TPS fuses the benefits of craftsmanship with the benefits of mass production, while eliminating the undesirable elements of both. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. Best of Both Worlds The TPS combines philosophical, technical and managerial principles that fuse the benefits of the old method of craftsmanship with the benefits of the newer mass production system, while leaving behind the undesirable elements of both. Craftsmanship is flexible but expensive. Until the late 1700s, craftsmanship was the production method. It aggregates processes, usually in one location with a few skillful experts. It delivers exactly what a customer wants when he wants it, but it was slow, expensive and not scalable. Mass production is less expensive, but inflexible. It favors disaggregating processes. Machines are designed and organized by function, instead of the flow of work. It aims to quickly produce large quantities of uniform products to increase revenue and reduce production and delivery costs through economies of scale. As Henry Ford famously said, \u201cAny customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\u201d Today, companies offer many product varieties across many industries. Product variety creates value, but when it\u2019s coupled with rigid mass production, it also creates waste and displaces other costs onto society because machines are less flexible than people. In other words, rigidity is imposed when a mass production system tries to maintain its prevailing goal of individual asset efficiency. Increasing product variety thus forces management to choose between stopping for equipment changeovers or running large batches. In batch production, we must choose between delaying deliveries or carrying inventory, since assets are tied up producing one variety while others are waiting. Unfortunately, neither delaying deliveries nor producing to forecast to compensate for long lead times demonstrates flexibility. The TPS takes the best of what each system has to offer. Toyota\u2019s leadership understood the limitations of each method, so they engaged shop floor personnel early on to reconcile the conflicting objectives of achieving both flexibility and mass production. As a production system, TPS is an economic model that is conciliatory and humanitarian. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. Philosophical Elements of TPS Reconciling mass production and flexibility requires a different type of thinking and a consistent purpose that is not sustainable without clear economic principles. As a production system, TPS is an economic model that is conciliatory and humanitarian. It sits on a different philosophical principle of efficiency called \u201cbasic thinking\u201d\u2014so much so that the term \u201cwrong thinking\u201d became idiomatic in the TPS vernacular of my Toyota managers. While I was working at the Toyota Supplier Support Center in Erlanger, KY, in the late 1990s, nothing mattered more to my Toyota leaders than correcting my wrong thinking. Toyota\u2019s basic thinking avoids favoring individual efficiency because it can lead to forced work and apparent efficiency. Individual asset efficiency for earned hours and revenue is forced work. This is a drastic departure from mass production thinking, which measures individual efficiency or how much an asset produces, regardless of when the customer needs it. However, producing anything outside of satisfying when and what the customer wants is overproduction, and overproduction is waste. Forced work leads to apparent efficiency. Forced work increases output and revenue, and it might reduce individual asset and production costs. However, the end result is apparent efficiency because the focus on individual efficiency leads to producing large runs of uniform products when alternating small runs of diversified products are needed instead. Large batches impose an operational rigidity that creates unnecessary direct costs and, most importantly, creates and displaces other indirect costs. The direct cost of unevenness in the schedule, as machines and workers operate to their own rhythm, results in planning irregularities and work detached from customer demand. The direct cost of waste comes from obsolete goods produced to forecasts, inventory stored in warehouses requiring conveyance, and unnecessary human activity. It ties up cash, hides defects, and compromises future revenue. Cumulatively, this type of poor resource allocation leads to the direct cost of overburden on people and machines. Even more concerning are the indirect costs to society, including unsustainable environmental pollution, which contributes to disease, biodiversity loss, soil death and climate change. With its relentless focus on eliminating waste, TPS offers solutions to the conflict between the need for profit and sensible environmental stewardship. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. The Economic Philosophy of TPS Instead, Toyota\u2019s basic thinking focuses on three different principles of efficiency. The first addresses total efficiency. The second addresses eliminating unevenness in the schedule, waste in work, and overburdened assets. The third addresses true efficiency. Total efficiency encapsulates the goals of achieving the highest quality, the lowest cost, and the shortest lead time of products and services from order acceptance to delivery. Not one of these factors can be overly weighed against the others. Rather, all three must be achieved to their utmost. This means keeping to the philosophical discipline of not giving higher weight to any factor, the way mass production does with individual asset efficiency, earned hours and revenue. It also means applying science to eliminate \u201cunevenness, waste and overburden\u201d instead of forcing work and settling for compromises of apparent efficiency, like the economic order quantity method and oversimplified return of investment calculations. Apparent efficiency is the immediate perception of gain and benefit when, in fact, less visible costs are displaced or new costs are created with payment due later. Standards of living have improved worldwide, but is this true for everyone and will future generations have a planet to enjoy it? TPS eliminates layers of unevenness, waste and overburden by deploying the \u201cstop and notify\u201d method, a process designed to make problems visible early so they can be solved quickly. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. Technical Elements of TPS TPS brings together a series of industrial designs that, when applied together, eliminate the trade-off between the goals of high quality, low cost and short lead-time. Financially, it translates to simultaneously meeting the need for profit, as reported in the income statement, and the need for operating cash flow, as reported in the statement of cash flow. Indeed, generating a profit is only one of a business\u2019s challenges. Another is to generate cash quickly enough to pay the bills on time! In mass production, those two requirements conflict because revenue and flexibility are at odds. To satisfy the need for profit and cash flow simultaneously, we must produce quality products and services to generate revenue from sales, we must reduce end-to-end value stream costs to increase profit margins, and we must shorten lead times to generate cash. TPS eliminates layers of unevenness, waste and overburden by deploying the \u201cstop and notify\u201d method, a process designed to make problems visible early so they can be solved quickly by experts when and where they occur. Ideally, this is done autonomously. Simultaneously, TPS requires one-piece continuous flow, a process designed to eliminate work stagnation. Together, these two procedures support each other in a symbiotic system to reduce the lead time and free the rate of supply to match the rate of pull. Shorter lead times make it possible to design and produce goods or services closer in time to actual customer needs, instead of relying on uneven and overburdening longer-range forecasts. Actual customer demand becomes the new shared operational data point, known as takt time. Knowing takt time enables management to determine how many people, machines and materials are needed to meet demand without wasting resources. Other principles of the TPS include jidokam just-in-time manufacturing and heijunka. Jidoka is the idea of building quality into the process. Just-in-time is the idea of enabling quick response to change by only building what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed. Together, jidoka and JIT eliminate unevenness in production schedules, overburden on assets, and waste in work. Heijunka is leveling the type and quantity of production over a fixed period of time. This enables production to efficiently meet customer demand. The TPS respects and honors humanity by cultivating meaningful, satisfying work to build self-worth. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. The Managerial Element of TPS The TPS requires a different managerial approach than the one offered by the mass production system. Specifically, Toyota worked to reconcile the creative nature of people with the repetitive and mundane requirements of industrial work. This requires developing workers who can work as a team while also becoming expert craftsmen at what they do. The TPS reintroduces craftsmanship into an industrial setting\u2014not in the same way, to be sure, but with the same importance. In mass production, machines triumphed over labor. People took a back seat, and machines became the most valuable asset. At the time, mass production was the best we could do to meet the world\u2019s seemingly unlimited demand for essential goods. At first, people benefited from the system by giving up their skills for increased living standards. Now, we realize the system\u2019s limitations. Entering the age of artificial intelligence, humanity will continue to be tested in even more challenging ways. The TPS can continue to play a critical role in reconciling the needs of business and people by embracing worker expertise at all levels, instead of frittering it away. In the TPS, workers learn to leverage new thinking and techniques to perform quality work efficiently and anticipate problems before they happen. If problems do occur, workers can identify and solve them rapidly and efficiently through a shared framework and knowledge consistent with eliminating unevenness, overburden and waste. On the one hand, it takes expertise to spot problems; on the other, no one who acquires expertise likes to waste it. This symbiotic relationship between the work people do, and their expertise enables people to reach their full potential and contribute toward the meaningful goals of highest quality, lowest cost, and shortest lead time. Therefore, the TPS respects and honors humanity by cultivating meaningful, satisfying work to build self-worth. Chasing profit from economies of scale implies higher output and reduces individual asset costs. But a higher output of what is not needed is wasteful. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. Environmental Innovation With its relentless focus on eliminating waste, TPS has brought about a third innovation to the larger aspect of our economies. It offers robust solutions to the conflict between the need for profit and sensible environmental stewardship. Society has a moral responsibility and the economic imperative to teach that chasing revenue by favoring individual machine efficiency at the expense of everything else is obsolete way of making a profit. Chasing profit from economies of scale implies higher output and reduces individual asset costs. But a higher output of what is not needed is wasteful. To produce is to deplete resources and emit pollution. We must also remember that, sooner or later, the things we make are destined to be discarded or trashed. When this kind of wrong thinking remains unchecked, thinner margins impede profits over time because all products succumb to commodity pricing. Thinner margins force businesses to merge to keep revenue increasing and delocalize work to lower-wage markets to maintain a profit\u2014places where the workforce must accept less-than-dignifying work, disconnected from the customer. Complex, expensive, fragile and polluting supply chains emerge, and services disappear, leaving consumers with few options and no competitive market forces to keep prices in check. Manufacturers must learn how to make only what is needed\u2014and to do it with less. Photo courtesy Toyota Motor Corp. Reshoring and Economic Stability Before joining Toyota, I worked in Silicon Valley with many semiconductor manufacturing plants. Once, the U.S. was a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. Today, 75 percent of semiconductors are manufactured in Asia. Of course, it\u2019s not just semiconductor industry that has moved offshore. Scores of companies across all industries have done so primarily because they lack the knowledge of how to operate efficiently. The erosion of a strong domestic manufacturing sector was a contributing factor to why the United States has endured two economic crises in the past 12 years. These crises required unprecedented institutional interventions to mitigate a rigid industrial economy that lacks resilience due to radical asset individualism and the waste it generates. Today, manufacturers are disconnected from demand. Suppliers are disconnected from their customers. Value has been disconnected from true wealth creation, and common sense has been disconnected from environmental stewardship. Instead of repeating the past, could there be a better way forward? We must learn how to make only what we need\u2014and to do it with less. That is true cost reduction. Besides helping the balance sheet, it will generate significant socioeconomic benefits. It will free industries from overreliance on economies of scale to reduce cost and fuel economic growth, and it will eliminate the need to shift the undesirable costs of environmental pollution onto others. Producing only what we need, with fewer resources, can help us achieve true economic prosperity. A sound economic framework and the coherent relationship between TPS\u2019s philosophical, technical and managerial elements are undeniably part of Toyota\u2019s corporate culture. This culture has sustained the long-term organizational consistency of purpose necessary to design and produce quality, affordable products only when needed and as geographically close to the customer as possible. The result is a congruent relationship between the interests of the firm, the employee, the consumer, and the environment. Realizing such shared consistency of purpose and harmony between traditionally divergent interests is no small feat; it took thousands of years to achieve. Organizations cannot achieve Toyota-like levels of operational maturity overnight. But, they will never realize their full potential if TPS remains a collection of practices to help leaders to think only in terms of trade-offs instead of congruency. We don\u2019t have to start solving our business and socioeconomic contradictions from scratch. The TPS has already solved key areas by rethinking how we design, organize and manage work. Editor\u2019s note: Olivier Larue is a senior executive consultant and president at Ydatum Inc., which partners with public corporations and private equity clients in operation design and management. He has more than 30 years of hands-on experience with the TPS. He worked with the Toyota Supplier Support Center in North America, the Toyota Operations Management Consulting Division, and New United Motor Manufacturing before founding a consulting firm in the Bay Area focused on implementing TPS in a variety of industries. He is the author of the new book, The Toyota Economic System. He will present a free webinar on the TPS on Tuesday, Oct. 3.

Sustainable packaging is necessary, in addition to the growing demand for various product options and pack sizes. Consumers may opt for a different food brand if the packaging is not recyclable, reusable, or compostable out of pure obligation to support environmental stewardship. To achieve a competitive edge in the market, companies are positioning their products based on criteria, such as product offers, quality, taste, flavour, pricing, size, packaging and marketing initiatives. Factors such as hectic schedules, the increase in single-person households, and the growing popularity of delivery and takeout services contribute to the rise of the ready-to-eat food market. Some stores are now specializing in offering prepared meals for on-the-go consumption. The convenience of instant or easy-to-prepare snacks and ready meals has gained significant popularity, especially among working-class individuals, teenagers, people living in hostels, and bachelors. The immediate consumption and convenience factors are closely linked to the appeal of ready-to-eat food, as it provides a quick and easy meal solution along with disposable packaging support. Moreover, there is a changing trend towards incorporating more plant-based\/vegan ingredients and adopting sustainable packaging with reduced plastic and waste. This shift is redefining how packaged food boxes are perceived, and brands are facing increasing pressure to offer environment-friendly products that are more effective in supporting the environment. Increasing Demand for Premium Ready-To-Eat Foods There are many different kinds of ready-to-eat food items available, including frozen pizzas, takeaway containers and pre-packaged meals. While the majority of people associate the word \"ready-to-eat\" with bad and unhealthy selections, there are also numerous healthy options available. As consumers demand items that are healthier, customised, and natural, several businesses are increasingly focusing on nutritious pre-made meals that can be enjoyed on the move. People are even willing to pay a higher price for premium quality foods because of rising health concerns among them. For instance, Nomad Foods Limited launched a \u201cGreen Cuisine Range\u201d under its brand name \u2018Iglo\u2019 which provides with a variety of delicious, simple-to-make plant-based meals, while focusing on the increasing veganism among masses. Surge in Demand for Convenience The global demand for convenient and instant food, including instant pasta, rice, snacks, meat products, and more, is experiencing rapid growth. This can be attributed to various factors such as changes in social and economic patterns, increased spending on food and beverages, growing awareness of healthy eating, shifts in meal patterns and dietary habits, the expanding expatriate population, and a desire for new food experiences. The United States stands out as one of the largest markets for ready-to-eat food, with Germany and the United Kingdom following suit. Additionally, emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and South America are expected to contribute to future growth in this sector. The popularity of instant or easy-to-prepare snacks and ready meals is soaring, particularly among individuals with busy lifestyles such as the working class, teenagers, people residing in hostels, and bachelors. The concept of on-the-go consumption aligns closely with the convenience and ease of handling that ready-to-eat food offers. Consequently, the demand for such products continues to rise, driven by the convenience of consumption and complemented by disposable packaging. For example, in March 2021, General Mills, a prominent American food company, introduced ready-to-eat cookies under their Pillsbury baking brand for the first time. Pillsbury offers Soft Baked Cookies in various flavours, such as chocolate chip, confetti sugar with drizzled icing, and peanut butter with chocolatey drizzle. Asia-Pacific Holds a Dominant Position The ready-to-eat food market in the Asia-Pacific region exhibits dominance, fuelled by the increasing demand for frozen and ready meals, including frozen meat products, snacks like pizza, frozen cereals, soups, and more. This market growth is further supported by the introduction of exotic products, the emergence of private labels, and the trend of product premiumization. Consumers\u2019 perception of ready meals continues to improve, as convenience and quick cooking time align with their preferences. China and India are anticipated to be key drivers of market demand in the region, given their robust growth and significant market potential. Chilled ready meals and frozen ready meals are particularly popular categories in these countries. Evolving consumer food preferences, such as gluten-free options, vegan choices, and sustainable packaging, bring added value to the market. As an illustration of product innovation, in February 2022, VegaBytz launched a range of plant-based, 100% vegan meat products in India. Their range of ready-to-eat meals and curry products, including meat\/chicken\/tuna alternatives, are purely plant-based. Companies operating in the market are also actively implementing strategic measures to establish a strong presence in these countries, further driving market growth. Increasing Women Workforce The increasing women workforce globally has been a significant driver for the ready-to-eat food market. As per the statistics by the World Bank, women contribute to 39.5% of the total labour force globally. With more women joining the workforce, there is a greater demand for convenient and time-saving food options. Ready-to-eat meals provide a quick and easy solution for busy working women who may have limited time for meal preparation. It offers convenience and saves time for women who juggle multiple responsibilities at work and home. It eliminates the need for meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking, allowing women to allocate more time to other priorities. As more women attain financial independence and take on leadership roles, they have less time available for cooking. Ready-to-eat meals provide a practical solution that allows them to focus on their careers while still enjoying a satisfying meal. Impact of COVID-19 Particularly during the COVID outbreak, the ready-to-eat food segment market has shown to be one of the fastest-rising and growing markets. Customers frequently purchased ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals during the pandemic because they were easily accessible and affordable. All restaurants, hotels, and shopping centres had established strict lockdown procedures, which had an impact on eating habits of people around the world due to lockdown and public safety procedures. Due to the lack of dine-out options, many individuals were persuaded to switch to home-cooked meals and packaged ready foods that could be delivered to their homes via home delivery possibilities by a variety of supermarkets or hypermarkets and e-commerce grocery stores. Fresh food had been replaced with packaged, long-life ready-to-eat meals out of fear of spreading the infection in public spaces. Impact of Russia-Ukraine War Russia and Ukraine export almost 12% of the food calories exchanged globally, making them important actors in the agriculture sector. The Russia-Ukraine war, which was a struggle between two significant agricultural powers, had a number of detrimental socioeconomic effects that were felt worldwide and could worsen the situation with regard to global food security. It caused a wide range of immediate and direct effects on food security, disrupting harvesting and shipping and seriously altering prices and staple supply. Another cascading effect of the war is panic buying, which can occur at both the national and personal levels. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stockpiling and panic buying were key aspects of crisis- and disaster-related consumer behaviour that drew significant media attention. In fact, during a crisis, people\u2019s lives become increasingly dependent on food, and panic buying is a typical human response to a stressful situation. Key Players Landscape and Outlook The global market for ready-to-eat food is characterized by intense competition, with key players like Nomad Foods Ltd, General Mills, Inc., McCain Foods Limited, Nestl\u00e9 SA, and Conagra Brands, Inc. leading the industry. To maintain their competitiveness, major market participants focus on various initiatives such as product innovation, launching new products, engaging in mergers and acquisitions, and expanding their geographic presence. For instance, in September 2022, McCain Foods Limited made an acquisition by purchasing Scelta Products, a Netherlands-based company.
