For National Geographic, sustainability is an essential component of the brand and is reflected in our storytelling, products, brand activations and nonprofit work. The existence of the people, places, and wildlife that we explore and celebrate depend on our decisions and actions. To combat climate change, resource depletion, pollution and social inequities we will make conscious choices about who and what contribute to the creation of our products, experiences, and supplies and we will consider carefully the short- and long-term consequences of their creation, use, and disposal on communities and the environment. Any individual, organization or company collaborating with or doing business with National Geographic, such as service providers and manufacturing suppliers, must be evaluated for their commitment to social and environmental principles, and National Geographic products, activations and promotions must be evaluated for their potential social and environmental impacts.

Fortunately, farmers are changing the game with emerging innovations to monitor herd health by optimizing reproduction and helping build consumer trust. Here are five new technologies that may help you get in the game. 1. Invisible fence for cows Founded in 2020, Corral Technologies is another new virtual fence company option. Cows wear a two-sided collar with GPS tracking and can provide stimulation to help keep cows within a virtual boundary designed by the farmer based on GPS coordinates of their property. Cows can become trained after five days of use, but if a cow goes through the boundary, her collar will send her an alarm and stimulation to guide her back inside the perimeter. Farmers can control and track cows through Corral's collars and software via phone, tablet, or computer. 2. An inclusive cattle feeder platform with real-time data and bookkeeping AgResult is comprehensive cattle management software designed especially for farmers raising feeder cattle for finishing and on a contracting basis. It also helps organize feed rations and bookkeeping. Whether through the app on your phone or via computer, you can get real-time data on feed inventory, costs per pound of grain, and average daily gain. The pricing for the product is a pay-as-you-go model and is based on the number of head of cattle. 3. Food verification to help build consumer trust Where Food Comes From (WFCF), Inc. is an independent third-party verification company that helps over 15,000 farmers, processors, retailers, and consumer brands build trust with consumers. The company audits marketing claims using USDA's Process Verified Programs, National Organic Program, and the company's own CARE program, which covers animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and community supply-chain sustainability. WFCF also uses SunHarvest, a custom software platform that creates metrics on management practices used to achieve the claim, including Passport Traceability, which can track a product to its source of origin. 4. Watch your herd\u2019s water intake Debuted earlier this year, Ranchbot is a water monitoring company that gives farmers insights into their water stock tanks to measure how much their cattle are drinking. Farmers can place Ranchbot's water level sensor in the water tank to monitor water metrics in real-time via a computer dashboard. The sensors and software can operate in remote locations with satellite connectivity. Access to the software is via subscription and costs $1 a day. The sensor costs $1,855. 5. Ear tags monitor bull health and performance Bull performance is essential to the success of a cowherd. For some farms, monitoring a bull's health can be a challenge. Farmers can use the 701x \u2014 XTpro's Autonomous Rancher software \u2014 and smart ear tags to collect animal footstep data via GPS. The data is connected to the Autonomous Rancher software and application. The platform can also send alerts to farmers' cellphones if the bull hasn't moved for an extended period or a high-speed warning if an animal moves above 29 mph. The platform also features a bull mounting algorithm to inform farmers which bulls are most proactive. Pricing is based on the number of animals a farmer records in the app and the type of operation.

This marks a significant moment for the company as it enters the American foodservice market with its first offering. The fillet will be served for a limited time, and the menu offering includes \u201cSeared Balsamic \u201cSalmon\u201d with velvety \u201cparmesan\u201d & chive polenta paired with roasted broccoli infused with thyme and a touch of zesty lemon.\u201d Formerly known as Plantish, the company underwent a rebrand earlier this year in preparation for its entry into the US market. According to Ofek Ron, CEO of Oshi, the rebrand aimed to encapsulate the company\u2019s mission and its commitment to environmental stewardship while conveying a deep-seated dedication to transforming the world\u2019s oceans. Established in 2021, the company specializes in creating alternative fish products, starting with salmon. Last year, Oshi unveiled its salmon prototype \u2013 a boneless fillet boasting nutritional attributes equivalent to traditional salmon, including comparable protein content, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids, while being free from contaminants such as microplastics and mercury. The product is crafted from a blend of legume proteins and algae extracts, featuring a fibrous structure akin to that of salmon, achieved through 3D printing technology, a method embraced by like-minded companies such as Revo Foods. Oshi\u2019s journey received a significant boost when it secured a joint grant of $1 million in collaboration with The Better Meat Co. a few months ago. This funding is directed towards the research and development of seafood alternatives based on mycoprotein. The ideal venue for Oshi\u2019s debut Coletta, strategically positioned near Gramercy Park, just blocks away from the Empire State Building, has been chosen as the ideal venue for the introduction of Oshi Salmon-Inspired Fillets. The 100% vegan and kosher Italian restaurant offers an intimate and exclusive dining experience, with brick oven pizzas, housemade ravioli, and artisanal vegan cheeses. Oshi isn\u2019t the first Israeli startup to find itself on Coletta\u2019s upscale Italian menu. Chunk Foods, with its Chunk Steak Filet, became a permanent fixture on the menu last year through a partnership with the restaurant. On its social channels, the Oshi Team expressed excitement about the milestone, stating, \u201cLaunching our product in New York is a huge milestone for us, and we are over the moon with the positive response we\u2019ve been getting from customers. So if you\u2019re in the New York area, swing by Coletta to experience firsthand the future of food.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Colleagues from all around the world, clients, partners, and local politicians joined company executives for the celebration of this important landmark. \u201cA 100 years! This is a great opportunity to pay tribute to our supportive business partners, valued customers and our talented employees who have all played a part in our success story,\u201d stated Antoine Chagnon, president and CEO of Lallemand. \u201cI raise my glass to those who built this factory, originally dedicated to baker's yeast for the local market, and the visionaries who made it a launching platform for the global company that Lallemand has become today.\u201d hagnon took the helm of the company in 2015, succeeding his father Jean, and grand-father Roland before him. Notwithstanding its respectable age of 100 years, Lallemand\u2019s Pr\u00e9fontaine plant has a bright and rich future ahead, due to the potential of microbes to help address some of the most pressing issues of our times. \u201cWe are all facing new challenges: climate change and feeding the entire planet are on the menu for the coming decades, and innovative microorganisms can play a key role in facing them. Among others, they can help us reduce carbon emissions, lower the use of antibiotics and chemical preservatives, and promote the use of microbial fertilizers or biological crop protection products that reduce the use of fossil products,\u201d said Chagnon. \u201cWe are also working on the next generation of probiotics to promote further health benefits.\u201d Lallemand now has diverse and global presence in 50 countries over five continents, employs more than 5,000 employees and operates 48 production facilities, including 24 yeast and 10 bacteria plants.

TORONTO, Oct. 2, 2023 \/CNW\/ - Reinforcing its commitment to sustainability, Melitta Canada is excited to announce several new initiatives to strengthen its global environmental stewardship efforts. Through rigorous third-party certifications from Rainforest Alliance, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), Melitta Canada is adding to its repertoire of sustainable labels, seals and certifications and helping Canadians Choose Better with planet-friendly coffee products. Melitta Canada launches its line of 100% Arabica Rainforest Alliance whole bean coffee along with its FSC\/BPI Certified filters. (CNW Group\/Melitta Canada) \"Sustainability is at the core of Melitta's mission, and we are thrilled to be launching the Choose Better campaign with the announcement of the new Rainforest Alliance, FSC and BPI Certifications,\" says Lori Brick, Marketing Manager, Melitta Canada. \"We know that Canadian consumers want to make better choices for the planet, and we believe that businesses play a crucial role in ensuring they are able to do so. These certifications mean that coffee drinkers can Choose Better and feel good about their purchasing decisions.\" Sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms and produced in accordance with its environmental, social, and economic standards, Melitta's whole bean coffees help create a better future by supporting farmers who employ responsible practices such as responsible land management and maintaining a habitat for native wildlife. The widely recognized sustainability certification allows consumers to choose products that contribute to a better planet. The newly certified line of 100% Arabica Rainforest Alliance Certified whole bean coffee includes the following varieties: Colombia Altura Blend, French Roast, Espresso Bellacrema, and Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me. \"We are proud to collaborate with companies like Melitta Canada to empower consumers to make better choices in their day-to-day lives.

By choosing FSC Certified products, consumers are supporting sustainable forestry practices, contributing to the conservation of forests, and helping to improve the livelihood of communities dependent on forestry. Melitta's White and Natural brown filter varieties are also manufactured using FSC Certified pulp. The BPI seal, now visible on its White, Natural Brown and Bamboo cone filters, is a recognized standard for compostability. It considers factors such as a product's biodegradability, disintegration, compost quality and timeframe and promotes sustainable consumption and waste management practices. Melitta's Choose Better Campaign, anchored by the announcement of the new third-party certifications, serves as a catalyst for inspiring Canadians to embrace more environmentally responsible and sustainable choices. Its overarching objective is to empower consumers, enabling them to conscientiously evaluate the environmental and social consequences of their daily decisions \u2013 big or small. Melitta acknowledges that each choice carries the potential to collectively shape the impact on both the environment and society. Canadians can now look out for Melitta's Rainforest Alliance Certified 100% Arabica whole bean coffee varieties and FSC and\/or BPI Certified cone filters at grocery stores across Canada.

In the release, Brenda Bailey, minister of jobs, economic development and innovation, said the provincial government continues to work and support First Nations and manufacturing companies in order to achieve long-term growth in the industry. \u201cBy investing in innovation, we\u2019re getting more value from the wood harvested in B.C., while creating and preserving high-quality jobs in the forestry sector,\u201d she said.

Stuwix Resources is a forestry management company owned by eight First Nations bands located in the southern Interior of B.C. According to their website, the mission of the market logging company is to maximize the harvested trees, which aligns with their commitment of environmental stewardship. According to the release, Stuwix Resources will be receiving up to $50,000 for planning activities toward implementing new processing approaches that will allow them to recover up to 35 per cent more marketable volume out of their tenure harvest. Lindsay Tighe, general manager at Stuwix Resources, said that support from the Province will allow them to go back to a traditional long-log program, increasing their ability to send the log to the right market, manufacture new products and explore markets such as bio energy, chips, shavings and firewood. \u201cOur communities and memberships\u2019 values expect full utilization of forest resources so that we are not wasting and burning usable sources,\u201d he said. \u201cOur project will create a new business line, allowing us to do more on-site processing and decrease our wasted fibre.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Nor-Feed is a leading French company in the development of plant-based additives, founded in 2003. Its primary objective is to eliminate the use of xenobiotics such as antibiotics, pesticides and synthetic solutions in animal feed. Following the success of Nor-Feed solutions in livestock, the approach has been extended to other species, including aquatic species. The use of their products in aquaculture has also shown many benefits leading to a fast development. Plant-based additives have demonstrated their efficacy within the field of aquaculture and are experiencing growing utilization in feed production. Nor-Feed's strength lies in its ability to focus on a limited range of perfectly characterized and standardized products. In other words, the concentration of active ingredients is known, communicated and always identical. The range includes: Nor-Grape, grape polyphenols to compensate oxidative stress. It is currently used in various species, from trout to shrimp, including salmon, tilapia, seabass, etc., to support the immune system and improve flesh quality.

In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the operation, the company launched a cost optimization and organisational efficiency program called the P300 project, which is expected to putthe business on the path to long-term sustainability. The losses for the 2022 is mainly related to an accounting impairment charge the company previously announced.

AG: The positive impacts of having a General Waste Management Facility include a significant shift from traditional practice of sending all waste to landfill to an integrated approach which is a modern acceptable practice. Economic benefits reduced waste quantity to landfill means prolonged life of landfill and hence cost saving from the need to expand the landfill space. Sorting waste for recycling purposes help to create and maintain downstream economy such as external waste recycling facilities which business entities on their own. In terms of social impacts, one of our core value is environmental stewardship, the facility is a testimony that we live by this value. This includes the creation of approximately nine direct job opportunities, comprised of general workers and equipment operators. In terms of environmental impact recycling helps to reduce pollution on environment and keep the site clean. Reduced amount of waste to landfill helps to reduce smelter foot print. The encouraging the use of recyclables to make new products help to preserve natural resources such as forests.
