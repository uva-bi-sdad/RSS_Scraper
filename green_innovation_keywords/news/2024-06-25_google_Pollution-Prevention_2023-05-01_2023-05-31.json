This includes, for example, manufacture of components for low carbon transport, or the conversion of transport to lower carbon alternatives. It is interesting that the Commission emphasises in its commentary that newly included activities may not only be those with the most substantial contribution, or the least harm to the other environmental objectives; this paves the way for certain activities, where there is presently no technologically or economically feasible low-carbon alternative, to be considered Taxonomy eligible or aligned. This is consistent with recommendations from the advisory body, the Platform on Sustainable Finance (\"PSF\"), which highlights the need for the Taxonomy to be a \"dynamic tool\"3 which can develop over time with technological and scientific development. A good example of this is the inclusion of aircraft manufacturing, which includes upgrading and retrofitting for compliance with the strict TSC. The rationale behind the inclusion of such transitional activities is not difficult to discern; demand for aviation services cannot realistically be expected to cease entirely, even if environmentally conscious consumers decrease their carbon footprint by flying less. Therefore, it is beneficial to ensure that the remaining demand for flights is met by aircraft causing as little environmental impact as technically feasible. This inclusion is, however, already proving to be controversial, as critics argue that rail and zero-emission aircraft should be encouraged over traditional aircraft with only minimal environmental improvement, and that allowing aircraft to qualify with only marginal reduction of emissions will lock in carbon-intensive assets for many years. The amendments to the existing TSC are planned to apply from 1 January 2024, with entities required to start reporting from 2024.","filter_flag":1}
