This article covers liquid chromatography (LC) columns and accessories commercially released after Pittcon 2022 through the 2023 conference held in Philadelphia. As in the past, LCGC sent out a survey in late 2022 and early 2023 asking vendors to supply information on products launched over the past year. Note that new products for gas chromatography (GC), LC instrumentation and software, and sample preparation are covered elsewhere. Information for this article was obtained over the course of many months; thus, it is possible that some information has been missed or misinterpreted. The reader is encouraged to check with specific vendor sites for additional product releases as well as more detailed information on product usage and attributes. Links to vendor sites are provided where applicable. The vendors that responded to the survey and their new liquid chromatography (LC) products are listed in Table I. Initial categorization of the products into small and large molecule analyses as done in recent reviews (1\u20133) was difficult this year because of the number of product line launches that included columns designed for both. The most reasonable segregation this year seemed to be oriented more toward the column technology the product lines were based on rather than their intended use. Many of the products and product lines released this year were based on recent, but established technologies, such as superficially porous particle (SPP) substrates. Many others were extensions of existing product lines with new surface chemistry or bonding processes. Products that fit into these descriptions as well as new chiral and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns were placed in the first category entitled, \u201cNew Product Lines and Product Line Extensions.\u201d A second category based on column hardware format was also deemed appropriate. Products in this category that were designated \u201cNontraditional Column Formats\u201d include the recently introduced 1.5-mm internal diameter (i.d.), capillary, and pillar array columns. The final column-based category includes a number of product lines that have been introduced based on inert column hardware, continuing a major trend from last year (4). Accessories are also an important component to any LC system. That is why the last section is devoted to \u201cnon-column\u201d new products that also contribute to successful liquid separations. New Product Lines and Product Line Extensions Chromanik Technologies Inc. released two new stationary phases for small molecule analysis. The SunShell C18 is built on a 90 \u00c5, 3.5 \u03bcm SPP surface. A \u201cunique end-capping\u201d process using high temperature and hexamethyldichlorotrisiloxane as the end-capping reagent is reported to result in an extended pH range of 1.5\u201310. The company also launched Sunniest PFP & C18, a mixed pentafluorophenylpropyl and octadecyl phase on a 120 \u00c5, 5-\u03bcm fully porous particle (FPP). The mixed phase is more hydrophobic and more stable than the PFP stationary phase alone. More information can be found on the Chromanik website. Fortis Technologies Ltd. introduced a new line of columns (Evosphere) based on monodisperse, FPP architecture. Monodispersity is reported to \u201cadd a new layer efficiency,\u201d while retaining high capacity for increased loading (as in preparative chromatography). According to the company, this is an alternative approach to gaining efficiency compared to using SPP-based phases. The new line is based on a 100 \u00c5 pore size that is available in 1.7-, 3-, and 5-\u03bcm particle sizes. Numerous surface chemistries are available, including C18 AR (C18 and aromatic mixed bonding), C18\/PFP, diphenyl, phenyl-hexyl, AQUA (proprietary polar alkyl blend), C12, RP18-amide, and PFP. For more information see Evosphere on the Fortis Technologies website. GL Sciences introduced a new SPP-based C18 column branded as InertCore Plus C18. According to the company, the InertCore Plus C18 columns are subjected to rigorous internal quality control (QC), resulting in superior reproducibility because of shell layer homogeneity. More information can be found at the GL Sciences website. The company also launched InertSustain PFP, a column based on 1.9 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, and FPP architecture. The column is recommended for highly polar molecules. Nacalai Tesque, Inc. introduced the Cosmosil RNA-RP1 column for the separation of large ribonucleic acid (RNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analytes, a major area of focus for the analytical community over the past few years. The column is based on a 5 \u03bcm, \u201csuper wide\u201d fully porous silica particle modified with C18. More information can be found at the Nacalai Tesque website. A new entrant this year, Scion Instruments, released Scion Hysil columns to the market. With both a C8 and C18 surface chemistry, the Hysil phases use a \u201chybrid\u201d substrate that has a particle size of 5 \u03bcm and a 120 \u00c5 pore. The company reports a pH range of 1\u201312 and notes that the columns are versatile for reversed-phase (RP) applications. It is also conveyed that the C18 is compatible with fully aqueous mobile phases. More information can be found on the Scion Instruments website. United Chemical Technologies released a line of their own SPP-based columns over the past year. The columns are based on a 2.7 \u03bcm, 90 \u00c5 particle that includes C18, pentafluorophenylpropyl (PFPP; note that the PFP designation may or not include the propyl spacer), and DA surface chemistries. The C18 is noted as being suitable for most acidic, neutral and basic compounds. In addition to reversed-phase applications, the PFPP can be used in both normal phase and HILIC separations and provides excellent retention and selectivity of amine-containing compounds as well as charged bases. The DA phase is described as a proprietary polyaromatic phase suitable for aromatic, conjugated and unsaturated analytes. It is also noted that the DA phase has the ability to analyze compounds that are difficult to resolve on C18. For more information, please refer to the United Chemicals website. Chiral Columns ColumnTek, LLC continued to build their portfolio by introducing Enantiocel AA (L). The column is intended for the enantioseparation of amino acids, hydroxy acids, and amino alcohols via a ligand-exchange mechanism using copper ion interaction. This is a silica-based column that has been modified with (L) penicillamine and is available in 3 and 5 \u03bcm particle sizes. Daicel launched the Chiralpak IM column, an immobilized cellulose tris (3-chloro-4-methylphenylcarbamate) based on fully porous silica. The company notes that this is an immobilized version of their Chiralcel OZ phase and that it provides expanded solvent compatibility. The columns, available in both 3 and 5 \u03bcm particle sizes, are suitable for SFC, normal phase, reversed-phase and polar organic high performance LC (HPLC) and ultrahigh-pressure LC (UHPLC) modes. For more information, please visit the Daicel website. Regis Technologies, Inc also introduced a new set of columns over the past year. The Whelk-O1 Core columns are built on a 2.7-\u03bcm SPP silica with their Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase (based on 1-(3,5-dinitrobenzamido)- 1,2,3,4,-tetrahydrophenanthrene), which results in faster and more efficient separations compared to similar conventional fully porous silica columns. It is also notable that the phase is available in both R,R and S,S forms should specific elution order be required. More details may be found at the Regis Technologies website. SEC Columns To go with their newly released RP columns for oligonucleotide analyses, Nacalai Tesque Inc. also launched Cosmosil RNA-SEC-1000 and Cosmosil RNA-SEC-2000 for the separation of RNA molecules based on size. The company notes that the 5-\u03bcm FPP columns are modified with a \u201chydrophilic functional group.\u201d For more information on these and related products, please visit the Nacalai Tesque website. Shodex launched a new SEC column called Protein LW-403 4D. The column is described as a 1.9-\u03bcm SPP phase with a hydrophilic surface that is suitable for analyzing proteins with high molecular weight. For additional details, please visit the Shodex website. Tosoh Bioscience recently commercialized the TSKgel UP-SW3000-LS SEC column. The 2 \u03bcm, 250 \u00c5, diol-modified FPP silica-based column is intended for the analysis of biomolecules with size-exclusion chromatography\u2013multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and SEC\u2013mass spectrometry (SEC-MS). The column features fast equilibration times, high robustness, and lot-to-lot reproducibility. Low \u201cshedding\u201d reduces noise in MALS applications. For more information, please visit the Tosoh Bioscience website. Nontraditional Column Formats Advanced Materials Technology, Inc. introduced the Halo 1.5 column line of columns for both small molecules, peptides and proteins based on their 2.0- and 2.7-\u03bcm SPP technology. The 1.5-mm i.d. columns are reported to provide increased sensitivity from conventional UHPLC systems, higher ionization efficiencies from LC\u2013MS systems, and higher efficiencies compared to 1-mm i.d. columns on UHPLC systems, while reducing solvent consumption (50% compared to 2.1-mm i.d.). According to the company, it is an \u201ceasy to implement\u201d microflow solution. The columns are available in multiple surface chemistries for small molecules including C18, LPH (a sterically-protected C18), and AQ-C18 (aqueous compatible C18) in their 90 \u00c5 pore size material. For peptides, an ES-C18 chemistry is available in the 160 \u00c5 format. A C4 and a diphenyl phase are also available for protein analyses utilizing a 1000 \u00c5 pore size. Additional information may be found at the Halo Columns website. Focusing more on peptide and protein analyses, MilliporeSigma also introduced a line of 1.5-mm i.d. columns under the name BIOshell 1.5-mm i.d. UHPLC columns. The company notes that the 1.5-mm i.d. geometry enables the chromatographer to operate at lower flow rates (saving solvent) without compromising efficiency or sensitivity. The SPP structure, combined with wide pore diameters, enables rapid and high efficiency separations of peptides, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies, and antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs). This line of columns includes C18 (160 \u00c5), C4, and diphenyl (both 1000 \u00c5) surfaces on a 2.7-\u03bcm SPP substrate. For additional information, please visit the MilliporeSigma website. Bruker Scientific LLC developed three new capillary columns geared toward peptide analyses. The columns are based on 1.5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5 fully porous C18 and endcapped particles that differ in dimensions. PepSep Max dimensions are 25 cm (length) x 75 \u03bcm (i.d.), whereas the PepSep Ultra and the PepSep Xtreme are 15 cm x 150 \u03bcm and 25 cm x 150 \u03bcm, respectively. The columns also feature \u201cinterchangeable tips,\u201d which reportedly offer robust \u201ctwist on and off\u201d connections. More information can be found at the Bruker website. Thermo Fisher Scientific introduced the \u03bcPAC Neo HPLC columns described as micromachined 2.5-\u03bcm diameter, C18-modified pillars in a silicon wafer. Columns are available in 50 cm and 110 cm lengths and are intended for nanoLC\u2013MS proteomics. Please visit the Thermo Fisher Scientific website for more information. Inert Column Hardware Shimadzu launched a large number of columns under the name Shim-pack Scepter Claris over the past year. The commonalities are a bioinert coating applied to the column body and frits as well as a wide pH range feature. A variety of pore sizes (80, 120, and 300 \u00c5) as well as a number of particle sizes (1.9, 3, and 5 \u03bcm) are available. Surface chemistry options include C18, HD-C18 (high density), C4, C8, Diol-HILIC, PFPP, and phenyl. For which phases are available on given supports, please visit the Shimadzu website. The company recommends the columns for analyzing metal-coordinating analytes and hydrophobic compounds such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids that adsorb to stainless steel surfaces. Waters Corporation launched a number of new lines of columns with their metal-passivated column hardware termed MaxPeak High Performance Surface technology. Common to each of these newly branded columns is the Premier designation. Under the Acquity and XBridge Premier BEH banners (hybrid particles 1.7 and 2.5 \u03bcm, 130 \u00c5) C8, phenyl and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) (bare BEH particles) phases were developed. The C8 is noted as being less retentive than standard C18 phases and exhibiting high pH stability. The phenyl phase provides complementary selectivity to C18 phases, especially for polyaromatic compounds and exhibits the same high pH stability as its C8 kin. The HILIC phase also shows pH stability and is used for highly polar compounds. Under the name Acquity and XSelect Premier HSS columns, both a C18 and a PFP phase were launched. The columns are built on 1.8 and 2.5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5 FPPs with high coverage noted. The C18 exhibits high retention and exceptional peak shapes for bases, whereas the PFP provides alternative selectivity to C18 and separation of closely related compounds with sharp peaks for bases. On the Cortecs Premier line (1.6 and 2.7 \u03bcm, 90 \u00c5 or 120 \u00c5 SPP supports), three chemistries were released, including C18, C18+, and T3. The C18 is described as a \u201cfull coverage C18 phase with endcapping,\u201d and it is intended for general use. The C18+ adds a weak anion-exchange character to the C18 that produces excellent peak shapes for bases when using formic acid or other low ionic strength acidic mobile phases. The T3 is noted as a \u201cmid-coverage C18 phase, with endcapping.\u201d The column is recommended for both nonpolar and moderately polar molecules, and it is 100% water-wettable. More details can be found on the Waters website. For large molecules, Waters released the Acquity Premier and XBridge Premier Protein BEH C4 columns. The pH-stable hybrid particle columns are available in 1.7- and 2.5-\u03bcm particle sizes with a 300 \u00c5 pore size. The C4 surface chemistry, combined with the particle and column technology, results in a column line suitable for intact mass and sub-unit analysis of proteins, including those that are phosphorylated. See the Waters website for additional details. YMC Co., Ltd. introduced their own line of bioinert columns labeled YMC-Accura Triart. The columns are built on inert hybrid silica particles (1.9, 3, and 5 \u03bcm and 120 or 300 \u00c5 pore sizes) and packed in hardware (columns and frits) deactivated with a bioinert coating. The columns are noted for their high pH and temperature stability and are recommended for oligonucleotides, (phospho)peptides, (phospho)lipids and other coordinating substances. Stationary phases include C18, C18 ExRS (extended pH and stability), Bio C18, Bio C4, phenyl, PFP, and a diol phase for HILIC separations. For additional information, please visit the YMC website. Accessories and Kits Knauer released a new line of column heating devices with varying capacities and features. Two channel systems for heating of the eluent is noted. For further details, please visit the Knauer website. MicroSolv Technology Corporation introduced a line of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) column hardware. According to the MicroSolv website, their all-PEEK HPLC column hardware is extruded from Victrex PEEK for maximum reproducibility and the finest chromatography. A small amount of graphite (20%) is added to the formulation in order to achieve a black surface sheen. There are no other chemical or physical treatments added to the process making these columns more biocompatible. Columns, frits and end-fittings are available in 2, 4, and 7.5-mm i.d. formats. Optimize Technologies released EXP Ti-REX fittings, a new hand-tight tip-sealing solution. The reusable fittings are used for connecting PEEKsil and fused silica tubing and are rated to 20,000 psi. Restek Corporation launched the Sidewinder LC column heater. According to the company, the unique design completely encloses any LC analytical column up to 25 cm in length. Two lengths of heater jackets are available where the short column holder accommodates columns up to 10 cm in length, whereas the long column holder holds columns up to 25 cm in length. The control module provides optimum heating performance (accuracy to within 1 \u00b0C) and stability to within 0.1 \u00b0C. The Sidewinder controller has fast 10 Hz sampling for improved responsiveness. The RS232 control allows external programming. For additional information, visit the Restek website. Novilytic developed a new proteomics kit that works with your existing HPLC system. The Proteometer-L kit is designed for rapid analyses of intact IgG and IgG fragments containing the Fc region in a harvested cell-Free culture filtrate (CFF). The kit measures (mAb) titer and relative aggregate content without the need for sample purification. According to the company, the kit offers the following advantages over existing methods for determining mAb titer and aggregate content: two critical quality attributes in one assay as critical quality attributes can be directly analyzed in crude culture filtrate (no additional purification needed), linear response from 0.5\u201316 mg\/mL mAb, very small sample volume is required (minimum 0.5 \u03bcL), and fast (10 min) runtime. For more information, please visit the Novilytic website. Conclusions Many of the new products and product lines introduced for LC over the past year are either new product line extensions (new chemical surfaces for existing brands) or whole new series based on advanced particle technologies, column hardware developments, or both. Some of the released lines are new to the companies, but they are based on established particle designs (SPP, for example). In another case, a new product line has been launched based on a new monodisperse, fully porous particle. Other new product lines are the result of new or newer technology combinations. For example, there are a few cases where SPP technology and hybrid particle designs are being combined to form improved or alternative column lines. In other products, new column formats are being combined with advanced particle technologies. It is also noted that the trend toward more inert column hardware continues to be significant based on the several collections of columns that have emerged. It is clear that LC vendors continue to put emphasis into new particle and column hardware technologies as well as efforts to best combine these advances to tackle an assortment of separation challenges.

The three-day event will take place from May 9th to May 11th in Hannover, Germany. Just a few weeks after Hannover Messe, we had the opportunity to catch up with the Chairman, Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler, to discuss what we can expect from the upcoming fair. Founded in 2015, LABVOLUTION is held every two years at the Hannover Exhibition Grounds, in Germany and is organized by Deutsche Messe AG, just like Hannover Messe. The event is a leading European trade fair for innovative laboratory equipment. This year\u2019s event will focus on digitalization, automation, innovative laboratory technologies, and solutions, as well as artificial intelligence and sustainability. Prior to the show, Deutsche Messe Chairman Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler shared with us exciting insights about what to expect from the fair. Starting tomorrow, the future of laboratories will be on full display at LABVOLUTION. We\u2019re excited to hear your thoughts on what groundbreaking insights the event will offer regarding digitalization, artificial intelligence, and sustainability. Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler: \u201cToday\u2019s laboratory infrastructures consist of many highly specialized devices from a wide range of manufacturers. Different interfaces and data formats make it difficult to connect these devices, let alone integrate them into existing IT infrastructures. However, this is a crucial requirement for end-to-end digitalization, automation, and the optimization of workflows. The success of tomorrow\u2019s laboratories will hinge on how well the various pieces of equipment perform in connected scenarios. The connected laboratory is the only way forward and how this may look like, can be experienced at our special display \u2013 our very own lab of the future \u2013 the smartLAB. Digitalization is generating enormous amounts of data. Industry 4.0 already demonstrates how the obtained data can be used effectively. Data is connected in order to monitor processes and recognize trends, which allows us to react to changes early on. These advantages can be transferred to laboratories alike. In the future, AI will be used in laboratories to combine and analyze large amounts of data in a very short time \u2013 faster than any human would ever be able to. One of the institutions presenting itself on the topic of artificial intelligence is the KIWI Biolab from Berlin. The aim of the Biolab is to link AI with biotechnology and to enable computers to plan and optimize laboratory experiments independently. Sustainability is increasingly influencing all areas of our lives \u2013 and of course, research and laboratories too. This is why we will conduct a LAB Sustainability Summit in cooperation with the Freiburg-based NIUB sustainability consultancy. Exhibitors and experts will provide inspiration and solutions for a more sustainable laboratory world. However, sustainability also plays a crucial role in other conference sessions. Speakers from the fields of molecular cell biology and genome editing will bring the latest facts and potential for shaping more sustainable agriculture. Alongside the supporting program, visitors can also expect to discover sustainable innovations, such as Green Elephant Biotech\u2019s CellScrew, a new cell culture system made from plant-based PLA.\u201d LABVOLUTION\u2019s focus on workflow optimization, communication standards, innovative laboratory equipment, and automation is set to revolutionize the laboratory industry. With such a broad scope of cutting-edge topics, what new products can we anticipate seeing at the fair? Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler: \u201cGiven the advent of automation and the widespread deployment of sensors and interconnected equipment, visitors can also expect to see a rise of smart laboratory containers, instruments, and equipment to be operated and monitored using tablets and smartphones. Start-ups too play an important role as they push innovation forward within the various laboratory technology segments.

Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler: \u201cSince 2015, smartLAB has been showcasing pioneering examples of the smart laboratory of the future. This year, together with our partner Smartlab Solutions GmbH from Dresden and 14 other exhibiting companies, we will be presenting new solutions for laboratory automation and digitalization in four use cases and a VR area. In addition to Smartlab Solutions GmbH, the smartLAB partners in 2023 are Eppendorf AG, 2mag AG, Better Basics Laborbedarf GmbH, D\u00fcperthal Sicherheitstechnik, Essentim GmbH, Kreativraum GmbH, INTEGRIS LIMS GmbH, Labforward GmbH, Berner International GmbH, Institut f\u00fcr Umwelt & Energie, Technik & Analytik e. V. (IUTA), Fraunhofer IPA, Amensio GmbH, smartAct GmbH and INTEGRA Biosciences GmbH. All use cases are completely new and have never been shown anywhere before! LADSvolution is all about holistic mapping, controlling, and monitoring laboratory processes. It is an intelligent solution for the automated and quality-assured consolidation of all the process information in one laboratory management system (LIMS). Testing the activity and efficacy of chemicals is a frequent question in the laboratory. In the workflow Smart Quality Inventory visitors can observe in real-time how a dye solution is tested for its thermochromic dye content. Investigations of product quality, especially in pharmaceuticals, are standardized control processes, as fluctuating product qualities of pharmaceutical products can be detrimental to health. Smart Safety Cabinet gives insights on how to support analysis by automation and process control. Especially in the field of cell culture technology, experimenters encounter an increased risk of contamination. The workflow Smart Cell Handling And Imaging (Smart CHAI), demonstrates how the integration of innovative tools can partially or fully automate the process of cell culture handling \u2013 thus reducing user interaction and the risk of contamination. In addition to the four use cases, the smartLAB also presents an innovative mixed reality experience in the so-called Meta-Lab. The virtual lab offers those interested an insight into modern laboratory environments and new ways of collaboration, communication, and intuitive knowledge transfer. Visitors are invited to try out the all use cases live on-site in the smartLAB in hall 20 at booth C40.\u201d What new discoveries can we expect from panel discussions on genome editing and green chemistry? Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler: \u201cNew genomic techniques (NGT) such as CRISPR\/Cas make it possible to modify and adapt the genetic material of crop plants in a targeted and precise manner. Scientists see these innovative methods as an important building block to complement classical breeding in the future. Their application makes it possible to overcome the limitations of classical plant breeding and thus contribute in many ways to more sustainable agriculture adapted to the consequences of climate change. So far, the use of NGT has been bound by the strict rules of European genetic engineering law, which dates back to 2001. However, the EU Commission sees very great sustainability potential in NGT \u2013 and is seeking to reform the regulation of these techniques.\u201d How many people are you expecting and how many exhibitors?","filter_flag":1}

Lozanovska came to FDU from Macedonia. \u201cI attended the Metropolitan Campus and was able to make friends right away,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring my junior year, I joined the undergraduate research team. They felt like my own community, and they made my years at FDU so much fun!\u201d Lozanovska will celebrate her undergraduate degree in biochemistry at the May 17, 2023, Commencement ceremony at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. From there, she will embark on her full-time professional journey with Cosmax USA. She plans to return to FDU to complete her studies in the 4 + 1 B.S.\/M.S. program in biochemistry and cosmetic science. \u201cIn Macedonia, life is more slow-paced and more relaxed. People prioritize leisure time,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the U.S., people tend to focus more on their career advancement, education and planning for their futures, which I personally like better.\u201d Lozanovska\u2019s interest in cosmetic science started in high school as she looked into different products and ingredients that would be good for her skin. \u201cI am passionate about science, and I like skin care products and makeup, so cosmetic science is perfect for me as it is the field where these two passions meet,\u201d she says. Lozanovska has learned a lot from her Cosmax co-workers. \u201cAs a chemist and a researcher, I get to be at the forefront of this dynamic field, working with a team of experts to develop new products and meet the needs and desires of consumers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating career path that allows me to combine my love of science and research with my passion for creativity and aesthetics.\u201d While at FDU, Lozanovska received support through the Gregory Olsen Scholarship for Academic Excellence and the Maria Avallone and Malcolm Sturchio Scholarships for Successful Research at FDU, which she says motivates her to continue pursuing academic and research goals. She started working part-time at Cosmax in January, after finding the company on Indeed.com. \u201cI got a full-time offer as a junior cosmetic chemist in January, but since I was still in school, they accommodated me as a part-time employee until I graduate,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lucky to get a job in the industry and division I wanted.\u201d Her work at the company includes researching and analyzing the properties of active ingredients and raw materials; developing, formulating and testing cosmetic products; and investigating and resolving stability issues with existing products. At FDU, \u201cUnder the mentorship of Mihaela Leonida [professor of chemistry and physics and pre-professional\/graduate school adviser], I developed invaluable research skills and was able to push my limits academically,\u201d Lozanovska says. \u201cShe trained me well in the laboratory and taught me a lot about working with data and analysis. Without her guidance, motivation and support, I would not be where I am today.\u201d In addition to her research, Lozanovska was a member of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and participated in FDU\u2019s Pre-health Society. Among her accomplishments is co-authoring a study published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules with Leonida and Alice Benzecry, professor of biology and microbiology, and co-presenting it for the Nanotek 2023 nanotechnology conference held in London, England, via Zoom. \u201cSeeing our work recognized and valued by experts in the field is an incredible feeling. I am grateful for the support and guidance of my mentors and colleagues who have encouraged me every step of the way.\u201d She also co-authored \u201cIonic Liquids Used to Enhance Catalase,\u201d which will be presented by Zoom at the Third International Conference on Green Chemistry and Renewable Energy in Tokyo, Japan, later in May. Lozanovska sees herself continuing to pursue research throughout her career. \u201cThere is still so much to discover and explore in my field, and I am excited to be a part of that journey.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
