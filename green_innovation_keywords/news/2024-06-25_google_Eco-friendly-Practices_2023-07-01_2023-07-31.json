By Elissa Decker It\u2019s no longer a secret that traditional manufacturing practices within the textile industry have had an adverse effect on the environment. Pollution, resource depletion, and waste generation are lingering concerns. Mass production and consumption have intensified these conditions. But there is hope for our industry. In recent years, there has been a notable shift towards sustain-ability, with several trends and innovations emerging to address the challenges faced. Now is the time for selective growth and new opportunities to reimagine the impact textiles have on the planet. This article explores now and next trends in sustainability that will shape the industry. Now: Fiber Solutions Synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon are the building blocks for a wide range of textile applications from technical to fashion. Utilizing recycled fibers like REPREVE\u00ae, SEAQUAL\u00ae, and ECONYL\u00ae diverts plastic waste from land and sea, addressing the global plastic pollution problem and reducing demand for fossil fuels from which polyester and nylon are derived. The manufacturing process of recycled fibers produces less green-house gas emissions when compared to the production of virgin fibers. Recycled fibers exhibit largely the same quality and performance characteristics as virgin fibers. By choosing products made from recycled polyester, manufacturers and end users give new life to materials that would otherwise end up as waste. Synthetic fibers are composed of plastics that can remain in our environment indefinitely because they are not biodegradable. Polyesters featuring technologies such as CiCLO\u00ae have entered the market to address this challenge. By embedding multiple biodegradable points throughout the polymer chain, enhanced fibers in landfill conditions can attract microbes that break down the fibers within as little as several years. This development is progress. Another trend is the increasing use of organic and rapidly renewable fibers. Manufacturers and end users are turning to organic cotton, hemp and bamboo to reduce the ecological footprint of their products. Organic cotton is grown without the use of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, minimizing soil and water contamination. Hemp and bamboo are fast-growing, low-impact crops that require fewer resources. These alternatives lessen the use of pesticides and energy during cultivation, making them more environmentally friendly than conventional natural fibers. Now: Conservation Textile manufacturing, which has traditionally required an excessive amount of resources, now has the critical advantage of new processes and technologies that make conservation possible. To address these concerns, textile manufacturers can now invest in energy-efficient machinery, utilize renewable energy sources, and optimize production processes to minimize waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These improvements are not only good for the environment, but also often for the bottom line \u2014so everyone can win. Traditional textile manufacturing is water intensive. The World Bank estimates that almost 20 percent of global industrial water pollution comes from the textile industry. Water is used in scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, sizing and desizing, and also as a solvent for dyes and chemicals. These processes generate wastewater, which requires cleaning. Textile manufacturers now can invest in equipment to reduce the generation of water consumption at its source. For example, waterless dyeing techniques are now possible through equipment like England-based Alchemie Technology\u2019s Endeavor\u2122 waterless smart dyeing technology, which eliminates wastewater and generates as much as 85 percent in energy savings. Surface design remains a compelling benefit of textile production. Conventional full coverage print methods create waste and can require high amounts of energy for operations. Digital printing is one print method that allows for the precise application of color resulting in smaller scale customization and the minimization of waste. Now: Recycling The circular economy concept has gained traction in the textile industry as it aims to minimize waste, extend the lifespan of textile products, and reverse overflowing landfills. Why can a fabric not be simply recycled like an aluminum can? The answer is both simple and complex. Ultimately, greater support is needed to create infrastructure for processing textile waste at local scale and limited resources are available. However, there is hope. In the retail industry, brands are increasingly implementing take-back initiatives, allowing customers to return used garments to stores for recycling. By collecting and sorting discarded clothing, manufacturers are taking on the responsibility of keeping items from the landfill. For textile manufacturing waste, higher quality recycling outcomes are possible through mechanical shred-ding and separation of uniform reclaimed fibers, enabling the creation of second-life textile products such as insulation, carpet padding or packaging. Despite challenges including sorting, transportation, minimum required quantities, and costs, demand for accessible textile recycling is increasing. Next: Fiber Innovation And Biobased Materials Fiber innovation and the development of biobased materials will continue to gain momentum. With a focus on reducing dependence on non-renewable resources, alternatives derived from a growing list of resources including agricultural waste, seaweed, and even bacteria are being explored. The advancement of biotechnology and biomimicry is expected to drive further innovation in this area, leading to the creation of novel sustainable textiles. For example, spider silk proteins produced through recombinant methods which exhibit exceptional strength or mycelium-based leather substitutes made from the root structure of mushrooms that look identical to natural hide leather. Innovation will also be focused on enhancing the properties of existing fibers. For instance, nanocoatings are being explored as a possible method to improve fabric durability and lifespan ultimately creating less waste. Next: Digitalization And Smart Textiles Digitalization is set to revolutionize the sustainable textile industry. The integration of technology and textiles will enable the development of smart textiles with enhanced functionalities, helping to drive innovation in other industries. From garments that monitor vital signs and activity levels to fabrics that change color or texture based on environmental conditions, these innovative textiles will offer new possibilities for sustainability and user experience. Smart textiles are being designed to improve energy efficiency, comfort and safety. Imagine piezoelectric textiles that generate electrical energy through mechanical stress, potentially enabling the integration of self-powering wearable devices and what that could mean. Digital tools and platforms will also optimize supply chains, enabling traceability, transparency, and efficient resource management. Blockchain technology, for instance, provides a decentralized and immutable record of every stage in the supply chain, ensuring that sustainability standards are met and counterfeit products are eliminated. This level of transparency enables consumers to make informed choices and support brands that align with their values. For textiles and beyond, digitalization drives sustainable manufacturing practices through real-time data monitoring and analytics. By collecting data on energy consumption, water usage, waste generation, and more companies are able to identify areas for improvement and implement resource-saving measures. In time these data can be leveraged through machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to optimize production processes, reducing material waste, and energy consumption. Increased advanced robotics and automation will transform companies by enhancing efficiency while minimizing errors and improving quality control. Next: Circular Economy The circular economy concept, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, will continue to shape the textile industry. The adoption of closed-loop systems will become more prevalent, focusing on recycling, upcycling and reusing textiles. This trend supports the reduction of waste and also decreases reliance on virgin resources, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient industry. Chemical recycling, sometimes referred to as molecular recycling or depolymerization, is an emerging technology that offers great potential for sustainable textile production. Unlike mechanical recycling which involves shredding fibers, molecular recycling breaks down textile materials at the molecular level, allowing for the regeneration of virgin-quality fibers. This process has the potential to be of heightened significance for textiles with composite compositions that are challenging to mechanically separate. By reprocessing textiles to original quality fiber components, molecular recycling could effectively close the loop. Several companies and research institutions are actively exploring molecular recycling technologies for textiles. These initiatives focus on developing efficient and scalable processes that can handle a wide variety of textile compositions. By investing in research and development, the industry aims to improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of molecular recycling, ultimately enabling widespread adoption. Furthermore, if industries can align on using the same source materials, the overall global circular economy could be significantly simplified. As molecular recycling technologies continue to advance, they have the potential to revolutionize the textile industry\u2019s approach to waste management and resource conservation. By converting used textiles into valuable raw materials, molecular recycling could be the answer to a sustainable textile ecosystem. Next: Transparency And Ethical Practices A big step forward is expected in transparency and ethical practices throughout all industries and supply chains. End users are increasingly expecting visibility into the origins of products, ensuring fair labor practices and sustainable sourcing. To meet this demand, companies will continue to invest in traceability systems like Global Recycle Standard, certifications like OEKO-TEX\u00ae, carbon neutrality off-set partnerships like ClimatePartner, or sustainability ratings like EcoVadis that promote responsible and ethical manufacturing practices. The emphasis on worker welfare and social justice in all industries throughout the world will continue to grow. Cause For Collaboration Awareness for the impact of textiles on our oceans will grow. Wearing and washing of textiles leads to fiber friction, a source of microplastics. Microplastics are highly concerning because they are threatening aquatic life including plankton, which produce 70 to 80 percent of the oxygen on the planet. In many ways, what is \u201cnext\u201d is urgently needed \u201cnow.\u201d Conclusion The textile industry is experiencing a profound shift towards sustainability driven by demand and the urgent need to address environmental challenges. From adopting ecologically conscious fibers to implementing resource efficient equipment and promoting circularity to embracing transparency, as participants up and down the supply chain, it is collectively redefining the industry\u2019s practices. The industry holds the power to contribute to the positive transformation of the textile industry and pave the way for a more sustainable future by choosing sustain-ability and supporting manufacturers committed to eco-friendly practices. The ongoing efforts within the textile industry highlight the importance of collaboration, truly sustainable and responsible ecosystem. By leading the charge, it can help other industries make the transition as well.

Choose reusable water bottles, coffee cups, and shopping bags to reduce plastic waste. Don't forget to recycle materials like paper, glass, and plastic to conserve resources and prevent them from polluting oceans or ending up in landfills.\u201cThere is a need to adopt a plastic-free lifestyle and work towards decarbonising our future. As an individual and dedicated efforts by civil society we can conserve our environment. As part of a global community of over 10 million people in 68 countries, we are proud of our efforts for environment conservation,\u201d said Sandeep Choudhary, Global Founder, Save Earth Mission said..Water, being a precious resource, requires careful conservation for the health of our planet. Simple actions such as fixing leaky faucets, using a broom instead of a hose for outdoor cleaning, and installing water-saving showerheads can significantly reduce water consumption. Additionally, practicing mindfulness in everyday tasks like washing dishes or brushing teeth can help in water conservation.The transportation sector contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Whenever possible, consider eco-friendly alternatives like walking, cycling, carpooling, or using public transportation. With electric vehicles becoming more accessible, making the switch to zero-emission vehicles can greatly reduce your carbon footprint.Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plays a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If feasible, think about installing solar panels on your property or supporting local and national efforts to invest in renewable energy infrastructure.Mindful purchasing choices can have a positive impact on the environment. Opt for products made from sustainable materials and support businesses that prioritize eco-friendly practices and ethical sourcing. Participating in clothing swaps or buying second-hand items can help reduce the demand for new products and limit waste generation.Trees serve as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Engage in tree-planting initiatives or support organizations focusing on reforestation efforts. Additionally, advocate for the preservation of green spaces in your community, as they provide crucial habitats for wildlife and contribute to cleaner air.Reducing energy consumption is essential in minimizing environmental impact. Utilize energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights when not in use, and ensure proper home insulation. Simple actions like adjusting your thermostat and utilizing natural light can lead to significant energy savings over time.The earth is the only home we have and we must do everything in our power to save it. \u201cThere is an important need for collective action to safeguard the planet. There is only one way to address the unprecedented environmental challenges, and that is through community efforts. Everyone needs to come together and work together to protect planet Earth and ensure it can sustain humans and other life forms,\u201d Amit Tiwari, Global Admin Head, Save Earth Mission, said.Protecting the Earth is a collective responsibility that extends beyond governments and large corporations. Each individual possesses the power to effect positive change through daily actions. By incorporating simple, eco-friendly habits into our lives, we can work together towards a more sustainable and thriving planet. Remember that even small contributions, when multiplied globally, can create a significant impact. Let us unite to safeguard the Earth for future generations and foster a healthier and more resilient world.","filter_flag":1}

Download ETAuto App Get Realtime updates Save your favourite articles Scan to download App Tesla says its first production Cybertruck electric pickup has rolled off the assembly line, nearly two years behind the original schedule.The company tweeted a photo on Saturday showing scores of workers in helmets and yellow vests surrounding the truck.\"First Cybertruck built at Giga Texas !\" Tesla tweeted, including a cowboy hat-wearing emoji. Owner Elon Musk retweeted the post.Musk unveiled the truck in late 2019, and Tesla had said production would start in late 2021, although the company has since cautioned that production would begin slowly and in smaller numbers than Tesla's other vehicles.With its wedge shape and stainless-steel body - which Tesla calls the exoskeleton - the Cybertruck looks nothing like a traditional pickup. Some analysts have panned it as a niche product that won't have broad appeal.Musk said in April that the company expected to deliver the first truck probably in the July-through-September quarter. He said that as with other new products, production would start slowly and then speed up.\"It takes time to get the manufacturing line going,\" he said, \"and this is really a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made. So let's see.\"The truck's 2019 unveiling veered off course when a window that was touted as unbreakable was spider-cracked when hit by a big metal ball, which prompted an expletive from Musk.Tesla originally said it would make three versions of the truck, ranging from about USD 40,000 to USD 70,000. Later the company removed prices from the page where customers can decide whether to plunk down USD 100 and place an order.Competitors have rushed into the electric truck market, including the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian Automotive's R1T. Both look like conventional pickups.Tesla is scheduled to report second-quarter financial results on July 19.","filter_flag":1}

Download ETAuto App Get Realtime updates Save your favourite articles Scan to download App Automaker TVS Motor Company maintains a cautiously optimistic view for the India business during the fiscal 2023-24.\u201cFor fiscal 2024, GDP is expected to be around 5.5% by various sources. Despite the difference in the specific forecasts, the general agreement is that India\u2019s GDP growth will remain highest among major economies,\u201d Ralf Speth, Chairman, TVS Motor Company, told the shareholders at the 31st Annual General Meeting (AGM).\u201cI am convinced that India can benefit from major shifts in the geo-political, geo-economical, and social landscape,\u201d he said.Speth noted that the rural recovery continues to be slow, which significantly impacts the growth trajectory of the economy. \u201cEl-Nino arriving early and affecting monsoon may lead to a weaker performance of the rural agricultural sector impacting the already weakened rural demand. Hence, the pressure on domestic moped and the economy motorcycle segments may continue.\u201dHowever, the company remains positive about the performance of the premium motorcycle and scooter segment due to improved urban demand.According to Speth, factors like pickup in urban discretionary consumption demand, improvement of consumer sentiment, moderation of global crude oil prices and the introduction of tax reforms leading to higher consumption driven by the availability of increased disposable income, will play a key role in determining company\u2019s performance.For the premium play, TVS is building premium sales and service experience centers for its customers across 500 dealerships in domestic & international markets. It believes that \u201ccommunity building through immersive consumer experiences will be crucial in moving the needle.\u201dTVS stated that the electric two wheeler industry clocked strong sales of 7.18 lakh units in FY23, marking a growth of about 2 times over FY22.Speth said as the EV industry is slated to grow rapidly, the company has robust plans for this segment. \u201cTVS will launch desirable, new products with latest technologies in electric or electronic architectures and high energy efficiencies. The PLI and FAME-II initiatives of the government will be fully leveraged by TVS to strategically build a sustained dominant play in this segment.\u201d\u201cThe heightened consumer interest is driven by the alluring \u2018Total Cost of Ownership\u2019, digital-first technology propositions, the FAME II and PLI support from the central government combined with state-specific support that EVs offer. If consumers consider increasing fuel prices, EVs are even more attractive,\u201d he said.The two wheeler maker, which sells the iQube electric scooter in the market, clocked sales of 97,000 units in FY23, up from about 11,000 units in FY22.Speth noted that as electric mobility gains momentum in India and other countries, it will prompt disruptions and structural shifts in the automotive industry.As per the company\u2019s partnership with BMW Motorrad, the automaker will be working jointly on design and development of EVs for the global markets.Rising high on acquisitions, TVS has stakes in emerging companies including EBCO UK, Drive X Mobility, ION Mobility, amongst others. With its acquisition of Swiss E-Mobility Group (SEMG), TVS aims to leverage the opportunity to expand the core product range into adjacent segments with electric bicycles, including e-kick scooters and e-cargo bikes, which are emerging trends.The automaker said it has set up a dedicated EV team to rapidly transform into electrification, ramp-up the direct and indirect product pipelines \u2013 and to offer its Indian tested, most reliable products internationally.Key export markets of TVS Motor are impacted due to forex shortages, inflation and high interest rates in the backdrop of existing geopolitical strife.The company expects the export of two wheelers would see a gradual recovery after the weak performance in FY23. \u201cThe Africa market is expected to improve with the moderation in inflation due to easing of monetary tightening globally. Expansion programs in LATAM, ASEAN and the Middle East will add further momentum,\u201d Speth said.","filter_flag":1}

This agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the HanesBrands Board of Directors, is the successful conclusion of the Company\u2019s previously announced evaluation of a range of strategic options for the global Champion business. HanesBrands has made significant progress in recent years to reignite its innerwear business, increase market share, attract younger consumers, and strengthen its operating model. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company intends to focus on extending its leadership position in the innerwear category and generating above-market growth through continued consumer-centric product innovation and increased investment across its portfolio of leading brands, including Hanes, Bonds, Maidenform, and Bali. Bill Simon, Chairman of the Board said, \u201cFollowing a thorough review of options for the global Champion business with the support of our financial and legal advisors, we are pleased to have reached this agreement with Authentic Brands Group that we believe maximizes value for Champion and best positions HanesBrands for long-term success. Importantly, we believe this transaction will enable the Company to accelerate its debt reduction while positioning HanesBrands to deliver consistent growth and cash flow generation through a focused strategy on advancing its leading innerwear brands and optimizing its world-class supply chain.\u201d Steve Bratspies, CEO stated, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of significant effort by our teams to position all of our brands on the optimal path for the future. Over the past three years, we have taken necessary actions to enhance the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance \u2013 returning to historical gross margins, reducing our cost structure, lowering our debt levels, and generating consistent cash flow. The successful completion of this transaction further simplifies our business, deleverages our balance sheet, and enhances the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance. As we begin the next chapter for HanesBrands, we believe we\u2019re in an even stronger position to further extend our leadership in innerwear, pursue new cost reduction opportunities as we ensure we have the right operating structure in place, and advance our multi-year flywheel to drive strong shareholder returns.\u201d The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024. Subsequent to the closing, HanesBrands will provide certain transition services for Champion, including operating the business in select regions through a transition period. HanesBrands expects net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $900 million, including working capital adjustments and other customary transaction costs and excluding the contingent cash consideration. In line with HanesBrands\u2019 commitment to debt reduction, the Company will utilize all net proceeds from the transaction to accelerate its reduction of debt and expects meaningful deleveraging on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. On a trailing 12-month basis as of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the global Champion business generated approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is net of approximately $60 million of stranded costs. The Company has specific plans to remove all stranded costs within a year of the transaction closing as it completes the transition of the business.

The campaign, launched on March 5th, 2024, features 11 mothers proudly displaying their bodies and sharing their motherhood experiences to inspire other women to embrace their bodies and change societal perceptions. Era Vashishta, mother of a 2.5-year-old shares her story \u201c I was diagnosed with chronic PCOD when I was 28, which got me very scared as to whether or not I would ever get pregnant or have a baby. I never thought of motherhood before this. Because of the PCOD it made me want to be a mom, because I thought maybe I might not happen. After which, I became a mom and everything changed. As soon as I met my baby that\u2019s when I knew this is someone I want to protect for the rest of my life, the love is unconditional. It was so scary and overwhelming, but once you hang on to all these feelings you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, I\u2019d never not want to be a mom. My scars are my tiger stripes, because I think I draw a lot of power from them. I\u2019m a mom and this body gave birth to a life, which is what makes me bigger, it makes me a tiger.\u201d Megha Asher, the Co-Founder and COO of Juicy Chemistry said, \u201cAt Juicy Chemistry, we believe in promoting self-love and body positivity, and we are thrilled to partner with Mommy Shots for this unique campaign. Through this powerful photo series, we hope to inspire and empower women to embrace their bodies, and scars not just physical but emotional ones as well, and celebrate their unique journeys of motherhood. As mothers ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with motherhood and the impact it can have on a woman's body and self-perception. We hope that this campaign will help shift the narrative and encourage women to see their bodies as beautiful and strong, no matter their shape or size. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty and promote self-love and acceptance for all women.\" Amrita Samant, Founder and CEO Mommyshots said, \u201cIn my world of photography, motherhood, babies and art, creating something meaningful that helps change the world obsessed with perfection was very close to my heart. We want to redefine beauty with every line and every scar that spells resilience strength and a unique journey, we want to go beyond the surface with this campaign. They\u2019re more than blemishes, they\u2019re badges of honor, they are tender and timeliness. I am super proud of the 11 women who came forward to normalize what the society has for far too long considered unsightly.\u201d Sonia Chandrakumar, one of the 11 mothers who posed and actively participated in the shoot said, \u201cThe journey of motherhood is very different for me, I had a really tough time the first 6 months. I had all kinds of nausea, I could not brush my teeth and I had a lot of body changes that took place. My husband was my greatest support because he constantly reminded me that there\u2019s something beautiful coming out of this and if you want something beautiful in life you need to cope with the changes that take place in your body or yourself. So I kept reminding myself and dealing with the challenges. I\u2019d describe my marks as Caleb\u2019s wonderful art palette that I have around my stomach. I would not want to get rid of my marks, I want to keep it as a memory.\u201d Motherhood scars, resembling intricate battle scars, symbolize the strength and resilience embedded in a woman's journey. Each mark narrates a story of endurance and courage, celebrating the remarkable strength of women. In honoring these scars, we acknowledge the transformative power of motherhood, inspiring women to embrace their bodies and celebrate their unique journeys. #scarsarebeautiful ","filter_flag":1}
