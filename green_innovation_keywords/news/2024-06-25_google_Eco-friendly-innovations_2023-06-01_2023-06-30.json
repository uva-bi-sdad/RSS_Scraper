Both machines were supplied and installed by Monotech Systems. Incorporated in 2007 as a brainchild of the two brothers, Saravanan and Satish, Saravana Graphics is known for printing and production of tags and labels for wearable garments and premium commercial prints. On their other product lines, Saravanan, managing director of Saravana Graphics, said that the company also engages in premium quality photo album printing, fancy cards, gift boxes, etc. He added that it uses both offset and digital technologies for short and long-run printing. The offset production setup of Saravana Graphics is equipped with Heidelberg Speedmaster SX 74. In addition to the company\u2019s success story in the offset domain, the two new Ricoh production digital presses from Monotech Systems have unfolded a new chapter for Saravana Graphics to scale new applications in the realm of commercial printing. The two digital presses boast advanced features for churning on diverse stocks for varied high-textured graphics. A fleet of other presses and post-press machines and equipment at the production facility of Saravana Graphics makes the company a one-stop printing and packing solution provider in the region. The facility is fully equipped with a string of six single-colour presses, six die-cutting machines, two paper-cutting machines and other range of finishing equipment. Saravanan said, \u201cWe chose the two Ricoh digital presses for printing garment tags of various textures and qualities. We use Ricoh Pro 8320S for printing variable data printing on tags. Also, this monochrome press is ideal for high-end commercial printing jobs. The Ricoh Pro 7200X is indeed a powerhouse of advanced features with its fifth colour station. We use this latest generation digital press for auto duplex printing of tags and premium commercial prints.\u201d The Ricoh Pro 8320S runs at 136-ppm for monochrome printing on substrates up to 350-gsm. On the other hand, the Ricoh Pro 7200X is a colour printing production workhorse capable of galloping at the speed of 85-ppm churning on media of up to 360-gsm to produce premium-quality tags and photo printing.
