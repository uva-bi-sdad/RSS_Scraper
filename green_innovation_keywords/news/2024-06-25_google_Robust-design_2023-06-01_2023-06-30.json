The new cartridge will be based on the latest design principles, including a modular design with removable catalyst beds which enable better accessibility during catalyst filling, axial-radial flow beds, lower pressure drop, etc. The cartridge, which will be installed in the existing pressure shell, will bring further benefits in terms of safety as no major welding activities are required during installation. The currently installed cartridge, based on a design by thyssenkrupp Uhde, has reached an extraordinarily long lifetime of 36 years in operation. Usually, replacements are necessary after two catalyst exchange cycles, approximately after 20 years. However, thanks to the robust design and high quality requirements set by thyssenkrupp Uhde during equipment manufacturing and testing, life times of 30 years and more are feasible. Kutay Durna, factory manager at \u0130GSA\u015e: \u201cWith this upgrade of our plant, we are ready for the future. Key decision points for choosing thyssenkrupp Uhde were the proven reliability of their products combined with reducing the energy consumption in our Kocaeli plant.\u201d Thore Lohmann, Executive Director Fertilizer and Methanol at thyssenkrupp Uhde: \u201cThis is further proof that our uhde ammonia technology can meet the diverse requirements of plant owners around the globe. Our proprietary design of ammonia converter cartridges meets the highest quality standards and, when retrofitted to ammonia converters, it hugely enhances plant performance.\u201d The improved reliability of the plant and the energy savings will be achieved by combining the new uhde ammonia converter cartridge with Johnson Matthey\u2019s high-performance catalyst KATALCOTM 74-1. This combination will open up the potential for a further increase in plant capacity in the future, for example for green ammonia production. The new equipment is under fabrication, and start-up is scheduled for mid-2024. thyssenkrupp Uhde will perform full supervision services during converter opening, catalyst unloading, cartridge disassembly, converter inspection, cartridge assembly, catalyst filling\/activation, startup and performance testing at this time. Besides supplying the new cartridge for \u0130GSA\u015e, thyssenkrupp Uhde currently has eight additional uhde ammonia converter cartridges underway for their current blue ammonia projects.","filter_flag":1}

The developer released a media statement earlier this week announcing both the commencement of construction, as well as the appointment of Figurehead as preferred builder. The 77-townhouse project received approval nearly 12 months ago, and shapes up as a key development in the growth of the east Melbourne suburb. The townhomes have been built to meld into the streetscape, accounting for both architectural heritage and the demand for high-end design within the area. Rothelowman has worked with Golden Age in the past, delivering Sky Garden, a similarly community-centric project. \u201cTheir commitment to a conservative and robust design and delivery model aligns with our obligation to our key stakeholders, the end users of our product,\u201d says Figurehead Managing Director Joe Grasso. \u201cFigurehead Construction has specialised in the delivery of townhomes since its inception in 2007, and for us, it\u2019s important in this challenging climate that we partner with a reputable team, and take on projects we have a track record of delivering to a high standard,\u201d said Joe. Gardens designed by Aspect Studio aim to enhance the sense of community through lush landscapes made ideal for families. An array of amenities have been integrated within the development, while three-level townhouses separate ground floor offices and upper-level living spaces in the hybrid work era. Ensuite bedrooms are also located on the ground floor which feature direct courtyard access, while the kitchen and living areas serve as connection points. Golden Age Founder and Managing Director Jeff Xu says he is delighted to have announced the appointment of Figurehead, given the company\u2019s reputation for producing high-end design outcomes within the construction phase. \u201cFigurehead has an extensive and diverse portfolio of more than 100 completed projects, all with unwavering quality,\u201d he says. Collectively, we are eager to deliver a thorough and proactive approach to this project as it is one that will lift the standard within the area.\u201d Over 80 percent of Floret\u2019s first stage has been sold, with new park front lots brought forward to cater to demand. Nearly half of the new releases flew off the plan within 24 hours, outlining the demand for buyers looking to create a life in Glen Waverley. Construction is scheduled for completion in 2025.
