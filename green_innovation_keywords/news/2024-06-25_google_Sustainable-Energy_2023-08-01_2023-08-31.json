To help everyone take action, we\u2019re working to share insights about the planet through tools and technologies \u2014 like Google Earth, Earth Engine and Environmental Insights Explorer \u2014 that combine a rich map of the world with advanced AI. With insights into how the planet is changing, we can build sustainability tools and support other organizations to do the same. And we can work toward our ambition to help individuals, cities, and partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. Now we\u2019re expanding our sustainability offerings with new products in Google Maps Platform. These products apply AI and machine learning, along with aerial imagery and environmental data, to provide up-to-date information about solar potential, air quality and pollen levels. With this technology, developers, businesses and organizations can build tools that map and mitigate environmental impact. Mapping the potential of solar energy To encourage the use of solar technology, we launched Project Sunroof in 2015 to help people explore the estimated solar potential and savings in their area. Companies soon became interested in accessing this information too, and now, we\u2019re offering this information to businesses. Our new Solar API uses mapping and computing resources to make detailed rooftop solar potential data available for more than 320 million buildings across 40 countries, like the U.S., France and Japan. To get these insights, we trained an AI model to extract 3D information about the roof geometry directly from aerial imagery, along with details about trees and shade. Plus, the Solar API accounts for factors like historical weather patterns in the area, energy costs and more. This means that businesses like solar installers can see how much sunlight buildings receive and potential energy savings, before even visiting the area. In turn, this technology allows homeowners to more quickly and easily install solar panels and contribute sustainable energy to the grid.","filter_flag":1}

Rapidly increasing global demand for hydrogen is also driving up demand for clean, green hydrogen production, which in turn requires vast amounts of green energy, electrolysers and peripheral electrical equipment. \"We are delighted to play a significant and enabling role in the growing hydrogen sector offering leading-edge advisory services and technologies to accelerate the energy transition,\" said Marco Berardi, Head of Grid & Power Quality Solutions and Service business at Hitachi Energy. \"Our solutions for the hydrogen sector support the generation of efficient and reliable clean energy. On the one hand, we offer world-class expertise in connecting electrolyser systems to the grid, and on the other, we are driving innovation in clean power generation leveraging hydrogen fuel cell technology.\" Power-to-Hydrogen There are several ways of producing hydrogen with varying carbon intensity. Water electrolysis uses an electrolyser and an electric current to split fresh water into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity used in this process comes exclusively from renewable sources like wind or solar, the hydrogen produced is called green hydrogen. Most hydrogen today is produced by reforming fossil fuels like gas or coal. These processes emit large amounts of CO 2 , while water electrolysis utilizing renewable energy produces a nearly CO 2 -free form of hydrogen. Green hydrogen is a new and complementing component in the electrification space, where Hitachi Energy can add substantial value and innovation. With vast domain expertise in grid connection and power quality solutions, it develops groundbreaking technologies that enable renewables integration, high power quality and reliable and resilient power grids. \"We expand in new directions to support customers with crucial innovations to meet the needs of the evolving global clean energy transition and offer advanced and proven solutions to connect high-power (>20 MW) electrolysers to the high-voltage grid,\" said Berardi. \u201cWe focus on optimizing the complete power supply system, from early-stage techno-economic studies and advise to grid connection and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) down to stack terminals and O&M software which increases your system performance.\u201d Hydrogen and renewable electricity are vital in the energy transition. For instance, a green value chain can supply clean fuel for heavy transport and supports hard-to-abate industries, such as steel, fertilizers, chemicals and oil and gas to lower their carbon footprint. It can also electrify remote construction sites, and provide clean backup power where it is needed. At all project phases, Hitachi Energy optimizes the costs, footprint, and efficiency of green hydrogen projects and helps remove the risk of not being grid-code compliant. Hydrogen-to-Power The restrictions on the use of fossil fuels are forcing us to rethink the status quo. To address this need, new products under development include a hydrogen power generator, based on zero-emission fuel cell technology. In 2021, Hitachi Energy and PowerCell agreed to collaborate on fuel cell-based power solutions contributing to the green energy transition. Hydrogen power generators are a disruptive replacement technology for carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based generators such as diesel gensets. A key feature of hydrogen is its capacity to store energy over long periods and convert it back to power when needed. Built to decarbonize sectors and applications such as remote construction sites and provide clean backup power, Hitachi Energy's hydrogen power generator will be available as a medium-power movable product (400-600 kVA) and a high-power stationary product (1 MVA+). This integrated and configurable clean energy generator can scale up to meet our customers' specific power needs.","filter_flag":1}

The trajectories of New Zealand and Puerto Rico toward becoming competitive nations may be quite similar; we shall highlight the strategies that propelled New Zealand's economic growth and draw comparisons to Puerto Rico's challenges. By examining New Zealand's success and identifying relevant lessons, we plan to present a comprehensive action plan for Puerto Rico to enhance its economic growth and competitiveness. New Zealand's has a GDP of $250 billion with a Per Capita income of $46,420, a total population of 5,122,600 million and a total area of 103,798.93 Square miles or 31 times larger than Puerto Rico. New Zealand's journey to becoming one of the world's most competitive nations was characterized by a combination of strategic policies, progressive reforms and a commitment to innovation. The following sections detail the key aspects that contributed to New Zealand's high rankings in competitiveness and provide a deeper understanding of how these strategies were implemented: 1. Diversification of the Economy: New Zealand recognized the limitations of relying solely on its traditional agricultural exports. To achieve economic diversification, they implemented: \u2022 Investment in Research and Development (R&D): The government-funded R&D initiatives across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and agriculture. This initiative leads to the development of new products and services with global market potential. \u2022 Innovation Hubs: The creation of innovation hubs and research centers encouraged collaboration between academia, industry, and startups, fostering a culture of innovation. 12 Lessons Puerto Rico Must Learn Before it Emerges from Bankruptcy The secret to embracing change is to focus on building a new future. 2. Trade Liberalization: Engaging in global trade agreements and reducing trade barriers opened up new avenues for economic growth: \u2022 Closer Economic Relations (CER) Agreement: The CER agreement with Australia established a free trade area, facilitating the movement of goods, services and people between the two countries. \u2022 Diverse Trade Partnerships: New Zealand actively pursued trade agreements with various regions, including Asia-Pacific and Europe, expanding its export markets. 3. Skilled Workforce: Investments in education and training played a crucial role in nurturing a skilled workforce: \u2022 Education Reforms: Continuous improvements in the education system aligned curriculum with industry needs, emphasizing STEM subjects, technical education and vocational training. \u2022 International Education: Attracting international students enhanced cultural exchange and contributed to the Economy by generating revenue from tuition fees. 4. Regulatory Reforms: New Zealand's efforts to create a favorable business environment were instrumental in attracting investments: \u2022 Ease of Doing Business: Streamlined regulatory processes, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and simplified procedures for starting and operating businesses. \u2022 Investment Incentives: The government offered incentives to attract foreign direct investment, such as tax breaks, grants, and support for establishing new ventures. 5. Sustainable Practices: Embracing sustainability and environmental practices contributed to New Zealand's competitiveness: \u2022 Clean Energy Transition: Investments in renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, wind, and geothermal power ensured a reliable and sustainable energy supply. \u2022 Agricultural Innovation: The agriculture sector adopted sustainable farming practices, organic farming, and value-added products, catering to global demand for ethically produced goods. 6. Quality of Life and Work-Life Balance: New Zealand's emphasis on quality of life and work-life balance was an attractive feature for both skilled professionals and investors: \u2022 Natural Beauty and Lifestyle: The country's stunning landscapes, outdoor recreational opportunities, and safe environment contributed to a high quality of life. \u2022 Flexible Work Policies: Promoting flexible work arrangements and remote work options further enhanced the appeal for locals and expatriates. 7. Strong Governance and Political Stability: Effective governance and political stability fostered an environment conducive to economic growth: \u2022 Transparency and Accountability: Clear regulatory frameworks, corruption-free governance, and efficient public administration contributed to a stable business environment. \u2022 Socio-Political Stability: Political consensus, social cohesion, and a strong rule of law provided a foundation for long-term planning and development. In summary, New Zealand's journey to becoming one of the world's most competitive nations was guided by a comprehensive approach that combined economic diversification, innovation, education, favorable regulations, sustainability, and quality of life considerations. These strategies, backed by effective governance and political stability, created an environment where businesses could thrive, investments could flow, and human capital could be developed to its full potential. It is this holistic approach that Puerto Rico could learn from and adapt to its unique context to enhance its economic growth and global competitiveness. Overview of Puerto Rico and Action Plan Puerto Rico, has a GDP of $106.5 billion 42.6% less than New Zealand with a Per Capita income of $22,419 a 48.29% less, a total population of 3,111,874 million a 60.7% less, and a total area of 3,360.5 Square miles or 31 smaller than Puerto Rico. Below we outlined in the plan of action for Puerto Rico, building upon the lessons from New Zealand's success: 1. Economic Diversification: Encouraging economic diversification involves moving away from over-reliance on a limited number of industries such as manufacturing and promoting the growth of new sectors. Puerto Rico can achieve this by: Commercial real estate with a global outlook In order to learn about the needs of commercial real estate investors and the opportunities \u2026 \u2022 Identifying Emerging Industries: Conduct thorough market research to identify industries with growth potential, such as renewable energy, technology startups, biotechnology, and sustainable agriculture. \u2022 Incentivizing Investment: Offer tax incentives, grants, and subsidies to attract local and foreign investors to these emerging sectors, fostering innovation and job creation. \u2022 Supporting Startups: Establish incubators and accelerators that provide resources, mentorship, and funding for startups in emerging industries. \u2022 Creating areas in all 78 cities with automatic permits for a wide range of businesses will convert Puerto Rico into an island with ease of doing business and will triplicate the number of new enterprises island wide. 2. Education and Workforce Development: Developing a skilled and competitive workforce is crucial for sustainable economic growth. To address the brain drain issue and retain local talent: \u2022 Revamping Education: Invest in modernizing and enhancing the education system to align with the needs of emerging industries. STEM Education must become our mantra, promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics. \u2022 Vocational Training: Enhance and Create vocational training programs that equip individuals with practical skills in demand by industries such as manufacturing, technology and renewable energy. \u2022 Higher Education Collaboration: Forge partnerships between local universities and industries to ensure that education is aligned with current and future workforce requirements. 3. Trade Agreements: Active engagement in trade agreements can expand Puerto Rico's market access and enhance economic growth: \u2022 Regional Partnerships: Seek participation in regional trade agreements, such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Central American Integration System (SICA) Dominican Republic-Central America FTA (CAFTA-DR) and Mercosur among others to access larger markets for goods and services. \u2022 Global Trade Agreements: Explore opportunities to join global trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) or bilateral trade agreements with key trading partners. \u2022 Export Promotion: Empower the trade promotion agencies with incentives, grants, automatic designation to assist local businesses in entering international markets and navigating trade regulations. 4. Fiscal Management and Governance: While the Financial Oversight and Management Board reviews all financial decisions, we must create rigorous financial implementation once Puerto Rico emerges from Bankruptcy. Addressing fiscal challenges and improving governance are essential for creating a conducive environment for economic growth: \u2022 Debt Limitation Legislation: Enact legislation that sets clear limits on the amount of debt the Government can incur, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the GDP. These limits can be based on Puerto Rico's ability to service the debt without compromising essential services. \u2022 Transparency and Accountability: Enhance transparency in government operations, budget allocation, and public procurement to build trust and attract investments. \u2022 Multiyear budgeting with Long Term Planning: Develop comprehensive multiyear budgeting that includes long-term projections of revenues and expenses. This approach promotes better planning, reduces short-term decision-making, and aids in identifying potential budget gaps. \u2022 Structural Reforms: We must transform the Government by doing away with unneeded agencies, services, and bureaucracy, creating a more spartan nimbler government. It will also significantly reduce the revenue-to-expense ratio. \u2022 Efficiency Measures: Implement cost-saving measures across government agencies to allocate resources effectively and direct funds toward strategic initiatives. 5. Infrastructure Investment: Improving infrastructure is a critical enabler of economic competitiveness: \u2022 Transportation Modernization: Upgrade transportation networks, including roads, ports, and airports and convert the \u201cTren Urbano\u201d into a real solution for mass transit to enhance connectivity and facilitate the movement of goods and people. \u2022 Renewable Energy Development: Invest in renewable energy infrastructure to reduce energy costs, enhance sustainability, and attract energy-intensive industries. \u2022 Digital Connectivity: Expand access to high-speed internet across the island to support digital industries and remote work opportunities. In summary, Puerto Rico has the potential to enhance its economic growth and competitiveness by drawing lessons from New Zealand's success and implementing a comprehensive plan of action. By diversifying the economy, investing in education and workforce development, engaging in trade agreements, addressing fiscal challenges, and improving infrastructure, Puerto Rico can transform its economic landscape and create a more resilient and prosperous future for its citizens. Maurice Mctigue and The New Zealand Miracle Maurice McTigue played a pivotal role in the economic reforms that contributed to what is often referred to as the \"New Zealand Miracle\". He was vital in implementing policies transforming New Zealand's economy and government operations during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his notable contributions include economic deregulation, state-owned enterprise reforms and privatization, fiscal responsibility, public sector reforms, local government empowerment, government streamlining and export-oriented growth. Maurice McTigue's contributions were rooted in the belief that empowering individuals, businesses, and local communities while minimizing government intervention could lead to sustainable economic growth. The lessons from McTigue's work highlight the potential for other economies, including Puerto Rico, to achieve similar transformations by adopting policies encouraging market-driven growth, fiscal responsibility, efficient governance and an open business environment. Are our political leaders ready to accomplish such a transformation? The importance in policy development is knowing first if the current policies work or whether different activities would produce better results. The critical requirement is identifying the public benefit sought and then seeking proof that the recent actions beneficially impact that outcome. Absent this proof, every decision taken may be described as \"Anchored in philosophical beliefs.\" \"The canvas of Puerto Rico's future is painted stroke by stroke with the brush of today's pivotal choices; each decision serves as a color that could define whether our work is a masterpiece or a failure; the future is in our hands.\"","filter_flag":1}

The cell is a world-first with the configuration of this material. Lithium Nickel Manganese Oxide (LNMO) technology replaces cobalt with cheap and abundant manganese as a scaffold to better use the lithium and nickel inside the battery cell. This means that the batteries are significantly more sustainable than existing technology, and the company can now create batteries that are not only more environmentally friendly but also more cost-effective. \u201cTo succeed in the energy transition and build a sustainable energy system, we must develop better cell technology and chemistry. This is the most significant step towards realising that ambition yet. I am proud of this tremendous achievement for our research team and all of Morrow. This truly carries our \u201cDNA\u201d,\u201d says CEO Lars Christian Bacher of Morrow. Morrow\u2019s work on LNMO battery cell technology started two years ago, with the team having made significant progress the last year. The company can now not only produce LNMO electrodes in lab-scale, but in kilometres under industrial conditions. The prototype cells have also passed all safety tests. LNMO cells made by Morrow will be branched into two product offerings. The first cells, LNMO-X, can supercharge heavy mobility (trains, trucks, and ferries) and the long-life Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) markets. \u201cWe are continuously improving this technology and have achieved faster and safer supercharging than we thought possible, which greatly improves performance under more challenging conditions such as cold weather. Partners and customers are very excited and have shown great interest in learning more about this R&D milestone,\u201d says Co-Founder and CTO Rahul Fotedar of Morrow. Morrow Batteries is planning the pilot production of prismatic cells with this technology at the Customer Qualification Line currently located in Korea, adjusting the last design details and getting ready for production.","filter_flag":1}

By News Bureau Solar energy is the future. With the government's push towards renewable energy and the increasing awareness among consumers, the demand for solar products will continue to grow. Havells is closely working with the stakeholders and has started investing aggressively to offer the right solar solution to its customers. The company\u2019s flagship solar grid tie inverter can be seen in more than 30000 homes and industries, shared Varinder Bhatia, Joint Vice President- Sales (Solar), Havells India Ltd. in an interview with Anurima Mondal, Associate Editor, Energetica India. Que: Please give us an overview of the Indian solar industry. Ans: India's solar industry has flourished over the years, thanks to the government's unwavering commitment to sustainable energy. The initiative to boost domestic production of solar equipment is a move to reduce dependence on imports and spur the adoption of solar technology. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) has played a crucial role in attracting foreign investment and facilitating the development of large-scale solar projects across the country. Renewable energy adoption boosted the economy and also created job opportunities. The 'Make in India' campaign has attracted additional investment and enhanced India's image as a global player in renewable energy. It's reassuring to see the positive impact of these efforts, as more and more companies are setting up production units, creating jobs and contributing to the country's growth story. The solar industry's progress is a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration, and we are excited to see what the future holds as we continue to push toward a greener, cleaner future. Que: Could you shed some light on Havells and its product range in the solar segment? Ans: At Havells, we keep striving to contribute to the growth of the Indian solar sector. We have been closely working with the stakeholders and have started investing aggressively to offer the right solar solution to our customers. Our flagship solar grid tie inverter can be seen in more than 30000 homes and industries. We offer both off-grid and on-grid solutions to our consumers.

Ans: The Indian government implemented several initiatives to promote the use of solar energy, including the 'Make in India' campaign, the National Solar Mission, and other policies. These efforts have attracted strong investment from large Indian houses & FDI. This has led to an increase in domestic solar panel production. India aims to achieve 110 GW in module manufacturing capacity by 2026 which is currently at 18 GW. India has already achieved 175 GW of renewable energy and it aims to achieve 450 GW by 2030. The govt. has taken a big initiative by introducing the PLI scheme to promote domestic manufacturing of solar components. Over INR 45000 crore has been allocated for solar PV manufacturing under the PLI scheme. Apart from this, solar direct subsidy transfer has been initiated by the government through the launch of the solar rooftop national portal. For residential consumers, the government is providing a 40 percent subsidy on less than 3 KW system and a 20 percent subsidy on more than 3 KW to 10 KW system. Today, India is one of the top five countries globally in terms of installed solar capacity. The steep climb in the installed solar capacity is a testament to the success of the government's efforts. Que: How can the PLI scheme establish Indian solar manufacturing companies to meet the global solar demand? Ans: The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is a game-changing initiative by the Indian government to boost the manufacturing industry and establish India as a major player in the global solar market. The scheme's primary aim is to promote domestic production by offering financial incentives to Indian enterprises that manufacture solar equipment. This would not only assist in minimizing import dependence but will also create job possibilities and national manufacturing champions. As a result, Indian companies will be better equipped to vie with their foreign counterparts in areas such as pricing and product excellence, all the while satisfying the rapidly escalating global requirement for solar energy. Additionally, the program will foster a robust ecosystem for procuring vital materials needed in the solar industry, ones that are of Indian origin. Que: As a joint report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research and Analytics, India has the potential to become the world\u2019s second-largest solar manufacturer by 2026. What are your views on it? Ans: We are proud to be a part of India's solar industry and are optimistic about its growth potential. It\u2019s exhilarating to witness the potential for India to become the world's second-largest solar manufacturer by 2026, as outlined in the joint report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and JMK Research and Analytics.
