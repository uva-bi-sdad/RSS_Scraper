WESTMINSTER, Colo., Dec. 14, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Today, Eunomia Research & Consulting and Ball Corporation released an updated \"50 States of Recycling\" report, building on the original, first-of-its-kind state-by-state comparable assessment of common packaging materials by using data on generation, recycling and disposal rates from across the United States. Key findings include: 9 of the 10 states with the highest recycling rates have Recycling Refunds (also known as bottle bills or Deposit Return Systems). While states with Recycling Refunds only account for 27% of the U.S. population, they account for 47% of all packaging recycled, 51% of all aluminum cans and glass bottles recycled and 61% of all PET bottles recycled. States with Recycling Refunds recycle 34% of packaging, excluding fibers and flexible plastics (FFP), through closed-loop end markets (i.e., can-to-can or bottle-to-bottle) compared to 7% for non-Recycling Refund states. Nationally, the value of material diverted from landfills is $2.6 billion , which only represents 32% of the value that could be captured annually. , which only represents 32% of the value that could be captured annually. There is around $6.5 billion worth of material that is lost to landfill annually that could be captured through more effective recycling practices. Since the last iteration of the \"50 States of Recycling\" report, overall recycling rates across the country have stagnated or declined. Several factors contributed to these declines, including pandemic-related shutdowns at many recycling centers. Currently, the U.S. recycles just 45.2% of aluminum cans. Getting that recycling rate closer to 90% by 2030 would create opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) \u2013 in 2021, 79 million MTCO2e of GHG emissions were avoided through recycling, comparable to removing more than 17 million vehicles from the roads - and grow our economy. The updated report ranks U.S. states by recycling rates while also examining the benefits of implementing policies such as Recycling Refunds, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which holds producers responsible for product management through the product's lifecycle. When the two policies are enacted alongside one another, the report found that states achieve higher recycling rates, maximize closed-loop recycling (i.e. bottle-to-bottle and can-to-can) and thereby deliver the best social, environmental and economic outcomes for the U.S. \"The recycling rates in our report represent the real recycling\u2014versus collection\u2014rate, meaning this rate is not what is collected for recycling, but rather what is available to be made into new products. Recycling rates in many states are still measured in terms of what is collected for recycling, so to enable a 'like for like' comparison between states, the collection rates have been adjusted to show the real recycling rate. Having a true assessment of recycling rates will better enable us to understand what policy and program measures are needed to capture more quality material, increasing circularity, reducing our need for virgin materials and thus helping protect the planet,\" said Sarah Edwards, Director, Eunomia North America. The 10 states with the highest recycling rates (excluding FFP) in 2021 include: Maine (65%); Vermont (51%); Massachusetts (48%); Iowa (45%); Oregon (45%); New York (44%); California (41%); Michigan (40%); New Jersey (39%); and Connecticut (39%). The 10 states with the lowest recycling rates (excluding FFP) in 2021 include: West Virginia (2%); Louisiana (4%); Tennessee (5%); Alaska (6%); South Carolina (6%); Mississippi (6%); Oklahoma (8%); Alabama (8%); Texas (8%); and Colorado (11%). When expressed as a monetary benefit, the total economic value of recycling in the U.S. is approximately $35 billion, accounting for gross value, employment income from recycling-related jobs and greenhouse gas impact reduction \u2013 comparable to removing more than 17 million vehicles from the roads. If effective recycling policies were enacted nationwide, such as pairing Extended Producer Policy alongside Recycling Refunds, the benefit of recycling would double to $70 billion annually. \"Many consumers want to, and think they are, doing the right thing when they put their can or bottle in the recycle bin. However, collection does not equal real recycling. Creating a true closed-loop system \u2014 where a can becomes a can, or a bottle becomes a bottle \u2014 will require a well-designed recycling policy that creates compelling incentives to recycle and expand recycling infrastructure and systems to ensure the process is simple, convenient and affordable for everyone,\" said Daniel W. Fisher, Chairman and CEO, Ball Corporation. As policymakers and stakeholders from across the supply chain work together to enact meaningful policies and develop effective recycling programs, the \"50 States of Recycling\" report should serve as a resource for developing beneficial programs for the future. How the next generation of recycling systems is designed matters, and smart policies and programs that work together are essential to deliver the best outcomes in the U.S. For more information and state-by-state analysis, view the full \"50 States of Recycling\" report.

These so-called \u2018high frequency purchasers\u2019 will be encouraged to reduce their consumption of clothes and to adopt more sustainable behaviours. Over a fifth of Irish people buy clothes several times a week and half of those report buying items they never wear, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. They love browsing the latest trends and don\u2019t find clothes shopping a chore. Most are women but 35% are men. The women tend to be under 50 and the men under 34-years-old. You\u2019re sure to see many of them hitting the shops today because these fashionistas are more influenced by sales than anything else \u2013 more than friends, family or social media. Maybe you\u2019ll see a high frequency purchaser looking back at you in the changing room mirror. \u201cIn terms of individual purchasers, [serial shoppers] might be the best representative of the consumer culture that we have,\u201d Solene Schirrer, textile waste campaign lead from the environmental NGO VOICE, told Noteworthy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like those people are bad,\u201d she said, it\u2019s a reflection of what consumers are being offered \u2013 they\u2019ve been taught to see clothes as disposable. \u201cIt shows that there\u2019s a clear lack of value put on the clothes, and that people don\u2019t get the link between the clothes and the resources it takes to make them.\u201d This suits companies who want us to keep buying.

Textile consumption volume \u2018a problem\u2019 Ireland is one of the biggest consumers and disposers of textiles in the EU. We consume 53 kg per person per year and throw away 35 kg, compared to the European average of 26 kg and 12 kg. The industry needs to change but at the same time, so do individual buying patterns, says Schirrer. High consumption needs to be \u201ca bit less socially acceptable\u201d at an individual level. Though they buy a lot of clothes, high frequency shoppers tend to be more likely to look out for ethical, sustainably-sourced and locally-produced clothes. But even if these shoppers are more conscious of what they buy, is the amount they buy undoing all their potential good? We asked Schirrer. \u201cThe problem is the volume,\u201d she said. Around 110,000 tonnes of textiles in Ireland end up in waste-to-energy plants or landfill each year. Recycling isn\u2019t the answer. Only 1% of clothes globally are recycled into new clothing, according to Schirrer. Often what is meant as recycling is really downcycling: using old clothing fibres as housing insulation, for example. \u201cYes, buy better, but also buy less,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s still confusion over what is really sustainable\u201d. Sustainability or greenwashing? It\u2019s difficult for consumers to know how to assess brands\u2019 sustainability claims. Recycled polyester, for example, tends to come from plastic bottles. What\u2019s the problem with that, we asked \u2013 isn\u2019t it all recycling? This \u2018open loop\u2019 recycling, where resources from one industry are used in another, might be better than nothing. Advertisement But the problem is that we still have all these waste textiles that we can\u2019t deal with and so that recycled polyester is likely to end up in landfill, just a bit later than it might have. Plus it gives industry \u201can out\u201d to keep using virgin (non-recycled) material and our consumption grows, says Schirrer. Much better would be \u2018closed loop\u2019 recycling. It\u2019s the idea of circularity where [we] reuse the same products for the same purposes so that\u2026 you don\u2019t use as many virgin resources. VOICE Ireland are working on a website, to be launched next year, where consumers will be able verify sustainability claims. The EU is also working on a \u2018greenwashing\u2019 directive which will make it harder for companies to make vague or misleading claims. In the meantime, Schirrer says, look for certifications and try to buy pure, natural fibres such as cotton or wool. Pure because current technology is unable to separate mixed fabrics such as stretch jeans which are a cotton-elastane mix. Natural because, she says, they are easier to turn into new textiles and \u201cin the worst case scenario\u201d are compostable. Data to inform policy and interventions The data on high frequency purchasers comes from a National Textiles Survey carried out by the EPA in 2021 but published this year. The survey and the 2024 awareness campaign are all part of the government\u2019s green ambitions to move Ireland towards a circular economy in which products are kept in circulation as long as possible through reuse, repair and recycling. \u201cTextiles is a priority policy area,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, because it wants \u201cto tackle the environmental degradation caused by this material stream and in realising its circular economy ambitions.\u201d Textile waste is a major global polluter.

It had its third meeting at the end of November with a progress report due in early 2024. The group is involved in the publicity campaign and has committed to publishing a National Policy Statement on Textiles, and to explore extending a producer responsibility scheme for textiles, although no date for those is set. What\u2019s an ethical fashionista to do? Even though they purchase more, frequent shoppers are also more likely to engage in some behaviour that is compatible with textile sustainability. 30% are willing to rent clothes compared to 24% of other consumers and 28% have bought second-hand clothing in the past 12 months compared to 17%. Schirrer says all these are great options for a fashion-conscious shopper. And for those who love the thrill of the hunt, Stephen\u2019s Day sales can scratch that itch, too, if approached more sustainably. Go to charity shops, buy natural fabrics \u2013 Schirrer recommends Irish linen or wool \u2013 and invest in a well-designed piece that will last a really long time which you couldn\u2019t afford otherwise. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018how many times will I wear this?\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cand then get creative in the circular economy.\u201d Are we doing enough to tackle fashion\u2019s throwaway culture in Ireland?
