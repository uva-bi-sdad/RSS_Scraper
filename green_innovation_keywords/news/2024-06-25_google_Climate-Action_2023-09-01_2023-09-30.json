New Ipsos research reveals that nearly half of American adults (47%) think the responsibility to make change that influences climate change lies with multi-national businesses, like Mars. The Ipsos study shows more than half of American adults (54%) say the American government has \"a great deal\" of responsibility to make changes that influence climate change, with as many (51%) saying that large businesses in the United States do. Mars recently unveiled its innovative open-source action plan\u2014the Mars Net Zero Roadmap\u2014to accelerate action towards achieving Net Zero emissions. The Mars plan includes a new target to cut carbon in half by 2030 across its full value chain \u2013 which translates into cutting carbon by 15 million metric tons \u2013 the equivalent to taking nearly 3 million cars off American roads and highways. \"Our entire Mars business in the U.S and around the world is committed to tackling climate change to help people, pets and the planet thrive - from manufacturing your favorite treats, foods and snacks, to your pet's nutrition and veterinary care,\" said Anton Vincent, President, Mars Incorporated North America & Global President, Mars Ice Cream. \"I am proud that our teams across pet care, veterinary health, and snacking and food are committed to revitalizing the planet through positive impact on the environment at every touchpoint \u2013ingredients like peanuts for Snickers, rice for Ben's Original and our Sheba\u00ae brand's dedication to restoring the ocean's vast coral reefs.\" Soil: Supporting the ground we walk on This year, NUTRO\u2122, a Mars-owned natural pet food brand founded nearly 100 years ago, expanded its partnership with Kiss the Ground, a nonprofit focused on the healthy soil movement. Together, the organizations are producing an educational mini docuseries that highlights stories of regeneration across the country. Kiss the Ground has been a key partner of NUTRO's Greater Ground program since it launched in December 2022. The program drives change for the health of soil everywhere through amplifying, educating and building support for healthy soil action. In the early stages of the partnership, NUTRO conducted research with Morning Consult to better understand how people think about their food. What they found was that while most consumers claim to be somewhat familiar with the process of food's journey from farm to table, around 2-in-5 people are not very familiar with the role soil plays in farming. Through storytelling, education and advocacy, NUTRO is putting in the work to bridge this clear awareness gap. The docuseries is currently in production and will premiere later this year. Oceans: Rebuilding the coral reefs For Coral Reef Awareness Week 2023, the Mars cat food brand SHEBA\u00ae announced a new partnership to restore reefs in Hawai`i. This commitment is part of the brand's larger Sheba Hope Grows\u2122 program, which aims to restore more than 185,000 square meters of coral reefs around the world by 2029. The Hope Grows program is powered by a global community of reef builders and ambassadors, which now includes Kuleana Coral Reefs, a nonprofit founded and led by native Hawaiians, fishermen, surfers, scuba divers, scientists and ocean conservationists who recognized an alarming decline in the overall health of local reefs and coastal ecosystems due to human impact and coral bleaching. SHEBA is helping scale up Kuleana's work across the Hawaiian archipelago, increasing from 10 to 30 restoration sites across O`ahu and Maui. With Hawai`i, the global Hope Grows program now spans 30 restoration sites in 10 countries across five continents, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Maldives, Mexico and Kenya. It's also an increasingly visible proof point that there's a human-driven solution to the human-created problem of coral losses due to climate change\u2014a solution that can be implemented at scale and inspire others to help. Waste: Rethinking Packaging Packaging is an essential part of the journey to get products into the homes of consumers\u2014but in a perfect world, that packaging material never becomes waste. Instead, it's recycled, reused or composted. That's why Mars, the maker of some of the world's most beloved treats and snacks, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to reimagine and redesign its packaging. Two innovations in this area include improved club jars for M&M'S, STARBURST\u00ae and SKITTLES\u00ae, and theater boxes for M&M'S. M&M'S theater boxes are now fully recyclable in U.S. with the removal of the traditional plastic overwrap. This sustainability step eliminates 98 metric tons of plastic waste a year, equal to the weight of a space shuttle headed into orbit. Mars also partnered with packaging supplier Berry Global to launch new club jars that contain 15% recycled content, replacing about 300 tons of virgin plastic per year. The easy-grip square jars are produced at Berry's manufacturing facility, using a single-pellet, food-grade resin to assure a clean, consistent packaging material sourced from mechanical recycling. In addition to including recycled materials, the jar itself is also widely recyclable. Available in three sizes, the new jars offer the same look and feel as previous jars \u2013 and the two larger sizes are 10 grams lighter per jar, saving 374 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) every year. Those CO 2 savings are equivalent to: 42,084 gallons of gasoline consumed 45,494,350 smartphones charged 72.8 homes' electricity use for one year Crops: Safeguarding the food we eat Mars Food's Ben's Original brand\u2014has made a commitment to sourcing 100 percent of its rice from farmers working toward more sustainable and climate-smart rice production practices, aimed at reducing GHG emissions, reducing unsustainable water use and increasing profitability for farmers. Mars is also a member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), a global alliance dedicated to helping small farmers grow rice sustainably and increasing their resilience to climate change. The most notable practice being adopted here is a technique called \"alternate wetting and drying,\" or AWD. AWD allows rice fields to dry out before irrigating, a groundbreaking method in an industry that has long relied on perpetually flooded fields. AWD not only saves water and emissions, but it also has financial benefits for individual farmers: By using these methods, farmers are also able to decrease their fertilizer input and irrigation costs. It's just another way Mars is building a more sustainable world for tomorrow, one grain of rice at a time. About Mars, Incorporated Mars, Incorporated is driven by the belief that the world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today. As a global, family-owned business, Mars is transforming, innovating, and evolving to make a positive impact on the world. Across our diverse and expanding portfolio of quality confectionery, food, and pet care products and services, we employ 140,000+ dedicated Associates.

The peak of global greenhouse gas emissions must be reached by 2025 in order to comply with the Paris Agreement. (Image by Michel Bednarek via Shutterstock) SDG13 focuses on \u201cClimate Action\u201d, and it is supported by education and actions towards climate commitments. However, the total number of countries included in the national climate plans is 193, meaning that 63 have not set a 2050 net-zero target yet. The US is divided. 50% of House Republicans, 60% of Senate Republicans and one-quarter of the total number of elected officials are climate change deniers. Since pre-industrial times, the average temperature of the Earth has increased by 1.1C, melting glaciers and raising sea levels. Now, the effects of climate change have begun to take an increasingly human toll. Millions of people have been uprooted, leaving them in poverty and without access to basic services like healthcare and education, along with widening social disparities, stunted economic progress and even inciting conflict. Roughly 700 million people might suffer migration risks by 2030 due to drought-related occurrences alone. If there is any hope of combating these effects, the peak of global greenhouse gas emissions must be reached by 2025 in order to comply with the Paris Agreement\u2019s mandate to keep temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It is now crucial to achieve a 43% decrease by 2030 and complete carbon neutrality by 2050. Through their unique contributions, nations are establishing policies to lower emissions and increase resilience to climate change. Despite these efforts, the 1.5C objective cannot be met with present national promises. Thanks to the United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the leaders of the world are starting to mobilise the economy and resources to reverse or at least slow down the impact that global warming and climate change have on both society and biodiversity. The 13th goal, Climate Action, aims to motivate more innovation and education on the matter, by creating new jobs in the sustainable market and by introducing more renewable energy consensus overall. What is SDG13? SDG13 focuses on \u201cClimate Action\u201d, and it is supported by education and actions towards climate commitments. For instance, community initiatives and personal choices can influence extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, that are threatening the Earth more and more every day. In order to comply with SDGs\u2019 purpose by 2030, SDG13 has five distinct targets: View all newsletters Sign up to our newsletter ESG data, insights and analysis delivered to you By The Capital Monitor team Sign up here Bettering and strengthening resilience to climate disasters in all countries. Reshaping policies to include climate change measures. Working on education and awareness-raising academically and institutionally for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Respecting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s goal to mobilise $100bn annually to help developing countries against the impact of climate change and operationalise the Green Climate Fund. Raising climate change-related planning and management in less developed countries. Nathan Goode, chief strategy officer of Social Value Portal, told Capital Monitor that \u201cSDG13 is essentially the glue that holds individual initiatives and actions on climate change together, and the link through to the social dimension to the SDGs. It is probably the most important and the most challenging of the Goals because it requires coordinated, coherent and sustained responses to climate change across all dimensions of society.\u201d The main points of action revolving around this Sustainable Goal regard recycling, composting, choosing reusable products, avoiding driving a car when public transport or alternatives are available, consuming less animal products and reducing paper usage. Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shared that a rapid and sustained overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is a vital element for the achievement of the 2030 objectives. The United Nations stated: \u201cUrgent and transformative action is crucial, going beyond mere plans and promises. It requires raising ambition, covering entire economies and moving towards climate-resilient development, while outlining a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions. Time is running out, and immediate measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.\u201d Are Western leaders weakening on climate change? The Center for American Progress published a study in 2021 stating that 139 out of 535 members of the 117th Congress are completely opposed to the acknowledgement of the existence of climate change. Among other Republican Party officeholders, however, over 50% of House Republicans, 60% of Senate Republicans and one-quarter of the total number of elected officials are still climate change deniers. Multiple leaders in the US have dismissed the issue in 2023 too, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis telling Fox News: \u201cI\u2019ve always rejected the politicisation of the weather\u201d and claiming that climate change is only a pretext for \u201cleft-wing stuff\u201d. Tim Scott, senator for South Carolina, also added to the climate change discourse, stating: \u201cThere is no doubt that [it] is having an impact on our environment. There is no doubt about that. I am not living under a rock.\u201d But he also told Fox News that it is \u201cridiculous to talk about a climate change emergency when we have a border emergency that is an existential threat right now\u201d. These are just some examples of Western leaders\u2019 positions regarding climate change and the emergent situation we are all living in. In contrast, Pew Research Center statistics show that the general American population, unlike its leaders, does support prioritising renewable energy sources, with 69% of people favouring the country becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Overall, even though there is a general consensus about the US augmenting its efforts to reduce the effects of climate change (74% of those surveyed), it is still evident how \u201cclimate change is a lower priority for Americans than other national issues\u201d according to the study. Europe, on the other hand, is less divided than America. Since 2014, its leaders have realised that there need to be specific measures in place to reduce emissions. The first objective was to reduce emissions by 20% by 2020 and, after achieving this objective, the continent endorsed a EU binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Funds such as the Innovation Fund financed through the emissions trading system and the Modernisation Fund also play a part in the efforts of Europe and its leaders. Despite its political divides, the US is one of more than 130 countries that have set a target in order to reach net zero by 2050. Indeed, the US introduced the Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050 plan. However, the total number of countries included in the national climate plans is 193, meaning that 63 have not set a 2050 net-zero target yet. There is still hope that all the remaining governments will invest in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to tackle emissions. Alongside the US, the UK, Norway, France and New Zealand also expressed their commitment to net zero. In particular, the UK is already in the process of mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent developments in green technology and infrastructure are behind the country\u2019s changing economic makeup. For example, the manufacturing industry today has a significantly smaller impact on the environment thanks to biodegradable products and the use of renewable energy. The transport industry, additionally, has also improved its sustainability by manufacturing electric vehicles with net zero emissions. Alongside these two main industries, other instances of greener sectors are construction, farming and even finance, thanks to green bond investing. However, the UK is still one of the major contributors to global warming, signalling that perhaps a more impactful and drastic strategy is needed. \u201cIn the UK, the frustrations of the Climate Change Committee, which must have been building for some time, have spilt out into the open,\u201d Goode said. Indeed, CCC Chairman Lord Deben stated, in a report to Parliament, that, \u201cThis year, the government has published more detail on their climate programme than ever before. But Ministers seem less willing to put that programme at the centre of their stated aims.\u201d Proof of this lies in former Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Grant Shapps\u2019s testimony that the UK government is on track to \u201cmax out\u201d the country\u2019s remaining reserves of North Sea oil and gas. In order to get back on track and respect the commitments established, there must be a long-term strategy to decarbonise the UK\u2019s electricity supply by 2035 as well as completely ban the sale of new hybrid, petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Is investment in SDG13 holding up? Even though it is not the SDG with the lowest amount of investments, SDG13 still has a long way to go in order to be on track for the 2030 objective. The Climate Policy Initiative reported that numbers regarding climate-related investments have been growing significantly, going from an overall $360bn in 2012 to around $620bn in 2019. The investment needed, on the other hand, is a lot higher, amounting to an average of $3tn a year in order to respect the Paris Agreement\u2019s terms. As impact investing makes its way within the climate change field, billions of dollars aim to support SDGs and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Many investors, especially between 2020 and 2023, have converted to sustainable profits, which augments personal profit for them but also results for the planet. Indeed, Trackinsight found 269 ETFs focused on the Climate Action goal, worth $90bn. The highest amount belongs to the iShares MSCI USA SRI UCITS ETF, corresponding to $9.47bn. With other players such as the MSCI World Socially Responsible ETF investing over $4bn and the Xtrackers ETF investing almost $5bn SDG13 has many players in its favour. Goode stated: \u201cThe willingness of businesses of all sizes to be part of the solution is undoubtedly here. But it looks as though many need help to figure out how to. This is where leadership comes in. Rather than acquiescing in or actively encouraging a growth versus environment stand-off, our political leaders need to invest their capital and resources in helping businesses to be part of the solution and navigate the challenges ahead.\u201d [Read more about the Sustainable Development Goals here","filter_flag":1}

However, there\u2019s huge potential for more progress, especially in battery materials.

However, there are gaps in the data currently available. This report explores where those gaps are and looks at what action could be taken by data providers and other stakeholders to build a data ecosystem that meets investor needs. Report Contents Report Contents Executive summary Context An enormous amount of investment is required to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. A number of investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives have been established to facilitate this investment. To make informed investment decisions and engage effectively with their investments, investors need robust and reliable climate data. Investors often rely on climate data and products from third-party data providers. As the number of these providers and their products grow, investors and other stakeholders, such as regulators and standard setters, have highlighted the importance of maintaining the quality of these products, given the role that they play in decision-making by investors. This report explores this by asking: What do investors need to know? Specifically, what data is needed by investors to support their commitments to reduce the real-world emissions generated by their investments? What is the quality and coverage of climate data offered by data providers, and what are the gaps between the data provided and investors\u2019 data needs? What actions can be taken by investors, by data providers and by other stakeholders to build a data ecosystem that provides the data needed by investors to deliver and credibly report on their net zero commitments? This report builds on previous literature by explicitly analysing what investors are looking for \u2013 using the requirements of investor initiatives as the basis for this analysis \u2013 against the landscape of available climate data and products. It highlights gaps between these needs and the data that was available at the time of the research. The research process involved: A review of the literature on investor climate data needs. A review of the requirements of the 17 major investor-led net zero and similar climate change frameworks and initiatives. A review of 62 climate data products, provided by 19 data providers, in September\/October 2022, followed by a feedback stage where the data providers were able to review the assessments of their products. Interviews, in October 2022, with 16 institutional investors around the world about their climate data needs. We recognise that the market is continuing to rapidly develop, with considerable innovation in the data provision space. Accordingly, we conducted a further round of engagement with a number of data providers in April\/May 2023 to validate our recommendations. What do investors need to know? The research finds that investors need to know: To what extent are individual investments (e.g., companies) aligned with net zero goals? To assess this question, investors need information on current emissions, current exposures to opportunities (e.g., climate solutions) and to risks (e.g., fossil fuels), the actions being taken to deliver real-world emission reductions, and the quality of an investment\u2019s climate change governance. To what extent will individual investments be aligned with net zero goals in the future? Here, investors need information on future emission trajectories, emission targets and the alignment of the investment\u2019s strategy with the goal of delivering real-world emission reductions. Is the current position of their portfolios and funds aligned with their net zero goals (i.e., in aggregate, are their investments net zero-aligned)? What level of emissions reductions will be required over time for their portfolios and funds to be net zero-aligned. Investors generally use net zero emission pathways to conduct these assessments. What is the coverage and quality of climate data? At present, the climate data providers assessed as part of the research provide reasonably good coverage of large companies (both listed companies and debt issuers) in developed markets. However, the data provider market is much less well-developed for smaller companies, for companies from emerging and developing markets, and for asset classes other than listed equities and fixed income, reflecting the coverage and quality of corporate disclosure globally. These gaps in coverage limit investors\u2019 ability to apply their net zero commitments to other asset classes. While the coverage of large companies in developed markets is reasonably good, the research identifies significant gaps in the quality of the data and information being provided. In part, this is a function of the quality and availability of the corporate data that underpins these data products. However, some gaps are attributable to the data products themselves and wider gaps in the marketplace, including: the transparency of the products; a lack of common definitions; limited availability of sector and geographic pathways; and poor coverage and reliability of portfolio-level metrics and methodologies. What actions can be taken? Our research points to a number of general conclusions about how the data ecosystem might be strengthened to better support investors with the delivery of their net zero commitments. Our recommendations are categorised into three overarching areas of the data ecosystem that explain why there is a disconnect between investors\u2019 needs and what the market provides. These areas are then broken down into seven themes. Figure 1. Summary of recommendations It will be important for the industry to reflect on these recommendations as it drives towards net zero. Although this report identifies gaps in the market, it also recognises that some of our recommendations are already being addressed by a number of initiatives, such as the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance. In addition, a number of data providers have started to offer or are designing products that respond to these recommendations. While there are clear signs of industry engagement and progress, there remains a pressing need for general agreement, consistent implementation and development of tools and methodologies to meet investors\u2019 data needs to support their net zero commitments. The following sections summarise the full set of recommendations that have been identified in the research. Improve corporate disclosure I. The coverage and quality of corporate climate change disclosures Standard-setters and regulators should introduce mandatory climate disclosure through regulation for public and private companies. In particular, these rules and laws should require: Disclosure of emissions on an ownership (equity) basis, including the following metrics (and targets): Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, broken down by type of GHG emission, the proportion of emissions that are verified, an explanation of changes in GHG emissions and climate targets, and the proposed strategy and dependencies to meet the targets. Disclosure of industry metrics and corresponding targets for those in the 12 most energy-intensive sectors. Publication of transition plans, describing how companies intend to align their business models with net zero by 2050. Improve coverage and quality of products I. Coverage of data products Data providers should extend their coverage of the investable universe outside of the current focus on listed equities and corporate bonds, and particularly beyond large entities operating in developed markets. Where needed, investors, investor-backed net zero initiatives and data providers should work together to develop climate data reporting and assessment methodologies for missing asset classes. II. Data provider transparency Data providers should ensure that they: Disclose the source(s) of entity-level emissions data and the reporting year to which the emissions relate. Provide ownership-based emissions data. Disclose the quality of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions data for each entity in line with a relevant, recognised quality score (e.g., that provided by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials). Disclose the uncertainty in emission estimates. Disclose the methodologies used for estimating current and future emissions. Disclose the methodologies, data and assumptions used for assessing climate change governance. Provide a detailed explanation for company and portfolio alignment assessment methodologies, in particular for implied temperature rise (ITR) metrics. III. Analysis of forward-looking company climate change data Data providers should provide products that analyse: The credibility of company emission targets, identifying the main factors that will determine whether such targets are likely to be reached. The alignment of a company\u2019s strategy (including its capital expenditure) with the company\u2019s emission reduction targets and climate change strategy. The abatement cost curves for companies\u2019 emission reduction strategies for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. IV. Portfolio-level metrics and methodologies Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives, in conjunction with data providers, should: Develop methodologies that enable investors to report on portfolio- and\/or fund-level real-world emission reductions and net zero alignment. Assess the overall uncertainty of portfolios\u2019 emissions, in both absolute and relative (intensity) terms. Analyse and report on the reasons underpinning changes in portfolio-level emissions and emission intensities, particularly: (i) changes in company enterprise value, including cash; (ii) new or divested positions; (iii) changes in entity weights; and (iv) changes in absolute emissions. Disclose the methodology, scientific basis and uncertainty of investment and portfolio ITR assessments. Develop tools to integrate the goal of net zero into strategic asset allocation at the portfolio or fund level. Facilitate data comparability I. Common definitions Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives should: Adopt a common definition of alignment for companies and other entities. Develop and agree a common approach to assess and report fossil fuel reserves. Develop and implement a common set of principles, or definitions, to be used by data providers for identifying climate solutions. Engage with data providers to adopt these three definitions, and to ensure that the data and information provided is aligned with these definitions. II. Sector and geographic pathways Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives should: Agree on a set of principles by which geographic and sector-specific transition pathways are developed. Agree on specific geographic and high-impact sector transition pathways. Engage with data providers to encourage them to use the specific geographic and high-impact sector transition pathways for assessing company alignment. 1. Introduction Why is climate data important for net zero? To meet the goal of the Paris Agreement to halt global warming, trillions of dollars of investment will be required in clean energy, zero-carbon transport, decarbonised industrial processes and climate-friendly agriculture. Institutional investors have a key role to play meeting its goals; they will provide much of the capital to enable the low-carbon transition, they can engage with the companies and other entities in which they invest to reduce their emissions, and they can engage with policy makers to create the policy frameworks and incentives necessary to accelerate decarbonisation. A number of investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives have been established to guide and support investors in these efforts. To make informed investment decisions and to engage effectively with their investments, investors need robust, reliable data about the climate change policies, commitments, practices, processes and performance of their investments. In practice, time and resource constraints mean that investors often rely on third-party data providers[1] to collate, aggregate and check data and to process that data in ways that meet investors\u2019 needs. These data providers, therefore, play an important role in supporting investors\u2019 net zero activities. The number of organisations providing climate data and related services to investors is proliferating, as is the number of products offered by these organisations. As the market for climate data expands, investors and other stakeholders have highlighted the importance of maintaining the quality of these products, given the role that they can play in decision-making by investors. About this report This report aims to help investors and data providers better understand the critical role of climate data and some of the factors that can ensure the market delivers decision-useful data that can adequately support investors\u2019 net zero commitments to real-world emission reductions.[2] Based on desk research and interviews with investors and data providers, it sets out to address the following questions: What do investors need to know and, specifically, what data is needed by investors to support their net zero commitments, in particular to reduce emissions in the real world? (Section 2) What is the quality and coverage of climate data offered by data providers, and what are the gaps between the data provided and investors\u2019 data needs? (Section 3) What actions can be taken by investors, data providers and other stakeholders to build a data ecosystem that provides the data needed by investors to deliver and credibly report on their net zero commitments? (Section 4) A number of reports have been published describing the landscape of investor-based initiatives and frameworks focused on net zero,[3] and analysing the quality of the data and the products currently offered to the investment market.[4] This report extends and refines this previous work. The research explicitly analysed what investors are looking for, using the requirements of investor initiatives as its basis, against the landscape of available climate data and products, to highlight gaps between these needs and the data that was available at the time of the research. The research process involved: A review of the literature on investor climate data needs. Analysis of the requirements of the 17 major investor-led net zero and similar climate change frameworks and initiatives. A review of 62 climate data products from 19 data providers, including a feedback stage with the data providers. In-depth interviews with 16 institutional investors from across the globe about their climate data needs. We recognise that the market continues to develop rapidly, with considerable innovation in the data provision space. For example, between the review stage in October 2022 and publication of this report, several new research reports and data products were released. This is why we conducted a further round of engagement with service providers in April and May 2023 to validate our recommendations. The report is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives and frameworks and of the major regulatory requirements for investors to disclose climate-related information. From this analysis, we derive a list of the data and indicators that investors need to meet these obligations. Section 3 critically reviews the climate data that is available from the data providers, examining its coverage, quality and relevance. Section 4 presents the main conclusions and offers detailed recommendations for investors, for investor-backed climate change initiatives and for data providers. Appendix 1 provides a detailed description of the research approach and Appendix 2 an overview of the investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives, frameworks, tools and guidance reviewed in this research. 2. What data do investors need to support their net zero commitments? Our interviews with investors were clear: in the absence of mandatory requirements for investors to commit to net zero emissions, investors\u2019 data needs are primarily defined by the requirements of investor-backed voluntary climate change and net zero initiatives. This section of the report therefore focuses primarily on these initiatives, with a brief comment on mandatory reporting requirements. The research uses this analysis to derive a list of the specific data and indicators that investors need for decision-making and reporting on net zero. Review of investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives The research identified 17 major investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives (see Appendix 2). These can broadly be categorised as: Sector-wide strategic forums that bring together net zero finance initiatives, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Commitment-based initiatives, such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA). Disclosure frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the PRI\u2019s Reporting and Assessment (R&A) framework. Tools and guidance that produce standards and methodologies, such as the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Strategy guidance, such as the Investor Climate Action Plan (ICAP) Expectations Ladder. As shown in Figure 2, the initiatives specify requirements in aggregate for their signatories and are sometimes informed by specific guidance documents \u2013 such as the NZAOA\u2019s Target Setting Protocol (TSP), which specifies the target-setting requirements for asset owners\u2019 commitments to the NZAOA.[5] The initiatives agree on many of the actions they expect of investors. In broad terms, they expect investors to: Make a high-level board commitment to reduce emissions or reach net zero in their investment portfolios. Establish appropriate governance processes for the oversight and implementation of these commitments. Measure and report on their financed emissions. This push has been supported by the development of robust guidance on emissions accounting and target setting for financial institutions (e.g., from the PCAF). Assess and understand their exposure to climate risk by conducting climate risk assessments (with many identifying scenario analysis as an important tool in this regard). Set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets across at least some asset classes. These should focus on real-world emission reductions.[6] Align investment strategies with net zero. Engage external parties, such as companies, clients and policy makers, to reduce their own emissions and support wider efforts to reduce emissions. Figure 2 also shows how the initiatives relate to each other, although the delineation and relationships are not always clear cut.[7] The other elements of Figure 2 illustrate the role of: Disclosure frameworks: many of the investors\u2019 requirements need to be disclosed against one or more disclosure frameworks. Tools and guidance: these help investors meet the requirements of net zero initiatives. In some instances, the tools and guidance could also reinforce these requirements or set specific requirements for investors (e.g., the ICAP Expectation Ladder). Figure 2. The landscape of investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives Figure 3 maps the requirements noted in Figure 2 to each initiative, the tools and guidance for initiatives and the disclosure frameworks.[8] As set out in the figure, there are differences between the initiatives, reflecting their different purposes and objectives, different types of initiatives (e.g., a commitment-based initiative or disclosure and reporting framework) and, in particular, the extent to which they emphasise emissions reductions versus investment risks.[9] The focus on climate change transition by the initiatives is important, as it requires investment and engagement actions to be aimed at reducing emissions in the global economy, rather than just reducing the emissions, or the investment risk, associated with or reported for a portfolio. While divesting from emissions-heavy investments may reduce the emissions intensity of a given portfolio and manage short-term investment risks,[10] it may not be consistent with an initiative\u2019s overarching priorities.

However, at present, there are no legal requirements in any jurisdiction which require investors to set a net zero strategy; investors\u2019 data needs are primarily driven by the requirements of the investor-backed climate change and net zero initiatives noted above. This includes data needed to meet disclosure requirements, such as the PRI\u2019s R&A Framework and mandatory reporting requirements. The R&A Framework requires PRI\u2019s asset owner and investment manager signatories to disclose whether they integrate climate change into their policy, governance and investment strategy processes.[11] In addition, specific disclosure requirements on net zero include: Disclosure by NZAOA members of their climate change solution investments. [12] Voluntary disclosure of net zero targets by PRI signatories in line with reporting requirements for the NZAOA and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMI).[13] While there are no mandatory requirements to develop and implement net zero strategies, there are an increasing number of mandatory disclosure requirements. Box 1 summarises these, which overlap with most of the requirements[14] from the initiatives listed in Figures 2 and 3. Box 1. Mandatory reporting requirements for investors While regulatory investor reporting requirements are not explicitly considered in this report, several countries, including Brazil, Canada, the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the US and the UK, have as of 2022 established or proposed climate change disclosure requirements.[15] These regulations focus primarily on investment risk management, with the majority encouraging investors to report in line with the requirements of the TCFD. However, it is worth noting that (a) these mandatory requirements may increase the number of data points to be reported by investors, and (b) the requirement to report creates pressure to reduce reported emissions. In addition, the development and adoption of sustainable taxonomies have also led to climate disclosure requirements for investors. For example, the EU Taxonomy requires investors (and other financial institutions) to disclose the proportion of underlying investments that are taxonomy-aligned, starting 1 January 2024, initially covering climate change mitigation and adaptation, with other environmental objectives to be introduced.[16] As the Taxonomy\u2019s screening criteria for climate change mitigation are aligned with the EU\u2019s commitment to achieve net zero by 2050, the disclosure provides an indication of the net zero alignment of investors\u2019 portfolios.We discuss the quality of corporate climate data that underpins investors\u2019 reporting in more detail in Section 3, but it is worth noting that corporate reporting requirements between jurisdictions can be inconsistent and may limit investors\u2019 ability to compare companies across jurisdictions. Investors\u2019 climate data needs We now look at the question of what data investors need to meet the requirements of the various investor-backed initiatives. Our research \u2013 the analysis of the initiatives, backed up by interviews with investors \u2013 suggests that investors want to answer four questions: To what extent are individual investments (e.g., companies) aligned with net zero goals? To assess this question, investors need information on current emissions, current exposures to opportunities (e.g., climate solutions) and to risks (e.g., fossil fuels), the actions being taken to deliver real-world emission reductions, and the quality of an investment\u2019s climate change governance. To what extent will individual investments be aligned with net zero goals in the future? Here, investors need information on future emission trajectories, emission targets and the alignment of the investment\u2019s strategy with the goal of delivering real-world emission reductions. Is the current position of their portfolios and funds aligned with their net zero goals (i.e., in aggregate, are their investments net zero-aligned)? What level of emissions reductions are required over time for their portfolios and funds to become net zero-aligned? Investors generally use net zero emission pathways to conduct these assessments. Figure 4 maps the framework requirements presented in Figure 3 against the four questions (or categories of data needs) above, identifying the data needed by investors to address these questions. As can be seen, some of the needs are climate data points (e.g., current and projected future Scope 1 and 2 emissions), others are derived data points (which combine climate data points with operational performance, such as measures of emissions intensity, where climate data is normalised by measures of corporate activity) and others are tools (which generally use climate and derived data points as inputs). In particular, it highlights that climate change-related information is underpinned by corporate climate change disclosure. Not all of the framework requirements in Figure 4 require climate data. Examples include the requirement for investors to set and publish a net zero commitment, and the requirement to integrate climate change into their governance processes. However, even in these requirements, climate data is often an important input into the decisions made or actions taken and is then needed to effectively track the actions over time. Figure 4.

What is the coverage and quality of climate data? Our research examined 62 climate data products from 19 data providers.[17] This section provides an assessment of the climate data and climate data provision from these products and providers against the climate data needs defined in Section 2. The assessment identifies a number of issues with climate data, which cut across all four of the categories of climate data needs. These fall into seven key themes: Coverage and quality of corporate climate change disclosures Coverage of data products Data provider transparency Analysis of forward-looking company climate change data Portfolio-level metrics and methodologies Common definitions Sector and geographic pathways Coverage and quality of corporate climate change disclosures As discussed in Section 2, climate change-related information provided by companies underpins the majority of the data products that are currently offered to investors. This means that the quality of corporate disclosures is the key influence on the quality of the data provided to investors. Our review of the literature and our discussions with investors and data providers suggest that there are significant limitations in the data being provided by companies, and therefore what data providers can make available to investors. Issue 1: Incomplete emissions data While company disclosure rates have improved, many companies still do not publicly report their emissions. For example, fewer than half of the companies in the MSCI ACWI broad global market index[18] publicly disclose their emissions (see Figure 5). Figure 5 also shows that the disclosure rates for Scope 3 emissions remain significantly lower than for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This is important given that, in many sectors and companies, Scope 3 emissions are many times larger than Scope 1 and 2 emissions.[19] Even where Scope 3 emissions are reported, investors raised concerns about the reported numbers, questioning whether all material category Scope 3 emissions were reported, and expressing concerns about a lack of transparency regarding the methodologies used by companies to estimate Scope 3 emissions and regarding boundaries, i.e., how far up or down the value chain they were set. Figure 5. GHG disclosure rates for MSCI ACWI IMI constituents, 2017 to 2022[20] In particular, investors highlighted the need for sector-specific emissions data for the 12 most energy-intensive sectors,[21] which should include Scope 1, Scope 2 and significant Scope 3 emissions, capturing both current and forward-looking data, and broken down (at 5- and 10-year intervals). In line with the sector-specific requirements, investors have also asked that emissions should be broken down by type of GHG, particularly for methane.[22] Issue 2: Emissions reporting boundaries not aligned with investors\u2019 data needs Investors need data that reflects their financial exposure to an asset; that is, reporting boundaries should be aligned with the financial accounts of the company. In the case of listed equities, investors need companies to disclose emissions on an equity (or ownership) basis[23] to enable them to correctly assess climate change-related investment risk, and to correctly account for their exposure to real-world emission reductions. Our interviews with investors and our review of CDP emissions data and corporate sustainability reports suggests that, in practice, many companies still only report on an operational control basis. This means that their reporting is not aligned with the financial accounts. While the main conclusion is that companies should report on an ownership basis, it is important to acknowledge that investors are also often interested in assets or investments where the company has operational control (e.g., joint venture mining companies). Therefore, companies should also \u2013 where relevant \u2013 consider reporting emissions based on operational control, but this reporting should be additional to and not replace ownership-basis reporting. Investor interviewees also raised specific concerns about the lack of clarity in the climate reporting of companies with complex corporate structures, and the frequent lack of clarity about the corporate or organisational boundaries used in reporting by companies. Issue 3: Lack of verification of reported data Ideally, investors would like data to be verified, as this would give them greater confidence in the numbers being reported by companies. However, at present, most reported climate data is not independently verified. This is an evolving area, with companies experimenting with different models of data verification and with regulators considering whether mandatory data verification requirements should be introduced.[24] Issue 4: Companies do not explain why reported emissions have changed over time Company emissions can change year-on-year for a variety of reasons: the company\u2019s own emission reduction and energy saving efforts; changes in the emissions intensity of the electricity grid; changes in production or activity levels; acquisitions or divestments; and changes in the manner in which emissions are calculated and reported (e.g., changes in the reporting scope or boundaries used, changes in assumptions, or changes in emission factors). Some of these may result in changes in real-world \u2013 or actual \u2013 changes in emissions (e.g., energy saving, changes in business activity, changes in grid electricity carbon intensity), and some may simply be accounting changes (e.g., changes to the scope of reporting). Furthermore, some may be a result of direct, purposive action by the company, whereas others (e.g., changes in the energy mix of the electricity grid) may be outside the company\u2019s influence. Investors need to understand the factors that drive changes in reported emissions, and companies should explain the contribution and actions that they and others have taken to affect reported emissions. Issue 5: Companies do not adequately specify their emission reduction targets Target-setting is complex. Companies need to set targets that are relevant to their business and to their contribution to the goal of net zero. Having said that, investor interviewees stressed that it is often difficult to make a robust assessment of the credibility of a company\u2019s climate change targets. Among the issues identified were a lack of clarity around the future trajectory of emissions from the company (e.g., how short-, medium- and long-term targets fit together), and around the proportion of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions covered by the targets. Companies also need to articulate their proposed strategies to meet their targets, including setting out their capital requirements, research undertaken, the underlying assumptions on legislation, technology and markets, actions to be taken, and the costs and benefits associated with these actions. These insights are in line with the recommendations of the UN\u2019s High-level Expert Group (HLEG) on net zero emissions commitments for non-state actors[25] and the NZAOA statement on the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) exposure draft.[26] The HLEG report asks companies to: (i) report separate targets for material non-CO 2 GHG emissions; (ii) include emissions across their full value chain and activities; and (iii) separate out embedded emissions within fossil fuel reserves, as well as any land use-related emissions and risk-adjusted sequestration in biomass. Similarly, the NZAOA statement specifies that strategies to meet targets should require companies to \u201cpivot towards a net zero future with near-term (every five years) science-based targets consistent with the long-term objective of net zero by 2050\u201d. Ultimately, a company\u2019s reduction targets should be reported in its transition plan. A number of initiatives have already looked to define what a \u2018credible\u2019 transition plan should include (see Box 2). In addition to the points noted above on target setting, they identify requirements or recommendations on other issues, such as verification\/audit and sectoral and geographic pathways. As the recommendations from these initiatives are relatively new,[27] defining \u2018credible\u2019 corporate transition plans remains a work in progress. Box 2. Defining credibility in transition plans A number of initiatives have attempted to define what transition plans should cover to be considered credible. They include: NZAOA, which defined a credible plan in Annex 1 of its statement on the ISSB exposure draft. [28] UN HLEG, which recommended what a company\u2019s transition plan must include. [29] The Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT), launched by the UK government in 2022, developed a draft gold standard for private sector climate transition plans in November 2022, which sets out a comprehensive list of disclosure requirements. GFANZ, which published its Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans[30] report in September 2022. It specifies the components of transition plans (i.e., disclosure requirements) that financial institutions will be looking for.[31] In addition, some regulators are working to define what they expect from transition plans. For example, in addition to the TPT, the European Commission has published its final European Sustainability Reporting Standard on climate change (ESRS E1), which sets out requirements under the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This includes disclosure requirements for a transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1). Investors would also like more up-to-date information about emissions and performance, with many commenting that company data is generally backward-looking (referring to the previous 12 months), and often released three months after the end of the reporting period. Interviewees acknowledged that this is not an easy issue to fix, given the need to quality-assure the data, and acknowledged that time is also required by data providers to incorporate new information into their products. To address the issues listed above, investors need access to high-quality climate-related corporate sustainability disclosure. Standards, rules and laws play an important role in requiring high-quality climate-related disclosure from companies; these have been increasing at both global and regional levels, as set out in Box 3. Box 3. The changing landscape of climate-related corporate data Companies are increasingly required to report on their emissions. The current mandatory corporate climate reporting requirements can be divided into disclosure of: (1) emissions (although usually limited to Scope 1 and 2 emissions), (2) TCFD-aligned reports and, albeit limited to the EU, (3) the proportion of turnover and investments aligned with national or regional \u201cgreen taxonomy\u201d requirements relating to climate change. There were major developments in climate reporting in 2022, which will expand the coverage and standardisation of current corporate reporting. At the global level, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation\u2019s ISSB consulted on its exposure draft standards (the ISSB EDs), which are intended to provide a global baseline for climate-related financial disclosures, subject to jurisdictional-level adoption. At a regional level, the US Securities and Exchange Commission consulted on its Proposed Rule, which contains mandatory climate reporting requirements for listed companies, while the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group consulted on its European Sustainability Reporting Standards Exposure Drafts (ESRS EDs), which will constitute reporting requirements under the CSRD. The ISSB has now released its final standards and the final ESRS have now been released. In addition, initiatives are also looking to improve the accessibility of this corporate data for investors (and other stakeholders). In particular, plans to create a Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU) were announced in 2022 by the Climate Data Steering Committee to address data gaps, inconsistencies and accessibility, with an initial focus on company and financial institution-level data for emissions and reporting of net zero targets (see Recommendations for the Development of the Net-Zero Data Public Utility).[32] The Committee is not a standard setter, but will align with the aforementioned standards, rules and laws. More details on the NZDPU\u2019s exact scope of work and work programme is still pending at the time of this report. Similarly, the European Commission proposed a European Single Access Point in 2021 to \u201coffer a single access point for public financial and sustainability-related information about EU companies and EU investment products\u201d.[33] In principle, this would provide investors with access to data and information reported by companies under the EU\u2019s CSRD, although the specifics of the initiative remain under debate at the start of 2023. Coverage of data products Coverage is measured using the number of providers servicing the asset class or offering the data point, which we recognise as a proxy for the breadth of coverage. Overall, our review of data providers identifies three limitations in climate data coverage. Issue 1: Limited coverage in asset classes outside listed equities and fixed income Listed equities and corporate bonds are the asset classes with the greatest coverage, in terms of the number of providers reviewed that focused on them. Real infrastructure and property are also reasonably well covered, with two providers offering products focusing on them. Other asset classes have not received the same level of attention. This is illustrated in Figure 6, which summarises the percentage of providers reviewed that cover different asset classes. (It is important to note that some providers address more than one asset class.) Figure 6. Percentage of the providers reviewed servicing each asset class The focus on listed equities, corporate bonds, property and infrastructure reflects the quality of corporate climate change disclosure in these asset classes and the fact that there are now recognised assessment methodologies for them.[34] The relatively good coverage of listed equities and fixed income, and the less comprehensive coverage of other asset classes, was confirmed by investors interviewed for this project. Most, particularly those based in Europe, felt that they had sufficient data for listed equities and corporate bonds to begin tangibly incorporating these two asset classes into their net zero strategies. Many had already set or were in the process of setting short-, medium- or long-term Scope 1 and 2 emission targets for their developed market portfolios in these asset classes. A number of investors have started implementing their commitments in other classes, particularly infrastructure and real estate (in line with the availability of products), but the lack of data is delaying progress. Interviewees confirmed that they generally prefer to wait for data to become available before making commitments in specific asset classes. Many were optimistic that the coverage of data will improve over time as methodologies are developed and adopted, as companies and other entities provide more information on their emissions and on their activities, and as data providers integrate this data into their products. For example, the Assessing Sovereign Climate-related Opportunities and Risks (ASCOR) Project[35] is developing an assessment framework for sovereign bonds. Issue 2: Geographic and size biases There are strong geographic and size biases in the products that are available for equities and fixed income. Most data providers have good coverage of large companies and of developed markets. However, emerging markets and smaller companies are less well covered, both in terms of the number of companies covered and the number of metrics or data points provided. Some initiatives are beginning to address this issue. For example, the UN HLEG has recommended that \u201c[n]on-state actors should build support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro enterprises in their efforts to decarbonise and green their business.\u201d[36] It specifically recommended that the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA)[37] commits \u201cto support SMEs, and other non-state actors in developing countries with limited resources, to develop high\u2011quality data and have their net zero pledges and transition plans verified\u201d.[38] The NZFSPA is set to consider this recommendation. Issue 3: Gaps in products on strategic asset allocation For listed equities and bonds, there is reasonable provision of data across most of the areas identified in Figure 3, with at least a quarter of the data providers reviewed offering data or other services in each area. However, very few data providers offer strategic asset allocation (SAA) tools. These are important for activities such as developing a decarbonisation strategy, integrating climate change into investment analysis and setting targets relating to climate solutions. The following sections focus on different aspects regarding the quality of climate data products. As the availability of data is a prerequisite to assess quality, the focus of the remaining thematic areas is on listed equities and corporate bonds. Data provider transparency Different data providers often provide materially different climate data for the same entity. Investor interviewees were clear that the lack of transparency about data sources and calculation methodologies limits their ability to use the data being provided. The research identifies the following areas where transparency is especially lacking. Issue 1: The source, quality and relevance of underlying emissions data Investor interviewees said they need to understand how reported emissions have been calculated or produced. The limited transparency on emissions starts with the transparency around the corporate data (as discussed above), including how companies have calculated or estimated their emissions. This data is then processed and disseminated by data providers. The investor interviewees were clear that data providers need to provide more comprehensive information alongside the reported emissions numbers. As a minimum, this should include: the source of the information; the year the information relates to; the reporting basis (i.e., whether equity or operational control); whether the company emissions data is verified; and, if relevant, the calculation methodology used by the company, including relevant assumptions and emissions factors (see below). Data providers are responding to these expectations. Many of those reviewed for this research do \u2013 for at least some products \u2013 identify sources and years for company emissions data, although there tends to be limited transparency on whether emissions are on an operational or ownership basis. However, where there are significant data gaps, data providers often provide emissions estimates to compensate. However, many of the investors interviewed expressed concern about the data being produced in this way, commenting that data providers are not particularly transparent about how they generate these estimates (e.g., around the methodologies, assumptions and emission factors used) or (where relevant) about how they assess portfolio alignment. This is not to say that reported data is necessarily better than estimated data from data providers in all instances, particularly as company reporting may similarly be reliant on estimation methods. Those investors that use more than one data provider need those providers to disclose the methodologies used to understand why estimated emissions differ between providers. As Box 4 indicates, there are various reasons why different providers may produce different emissions data. Box 4. Some reasons for differing emissions estimates Emissions estimates for the same entity may differ between data providers because of: The basis for the emission factors (e.g., whether based on revenue or financial metrics, or on underlying activity). The granularity of the emission calculation process (e.g., where emissions are estimated site by site, at a divisional level, or at the parent company level). The relevance of the emission correlation to the entity in question (e.g., whether an appropriate peer group \u2013 in terms of geography or underlying activities \u2013 was used to develop the emission estimation correlation). How often the methodology and correlations are updated, and whether they represent the most recently available data. The extent to which companies\u2019 own data is used (and the quality of that data relative to the calculated data). For Scope 2 \u2013 electricity consumption \u2013 emission estimates, the extent to which location-specific and fuel-specific emission factors are used. Quality control processes within the data provider. Some data providers have responded to demands from investors for the calculation methodology by using a data quality score. An example of this is provided in Box 5. Box 5. The PCAF Data Quality Score for listed equities and corporate bonds The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) has developed a ranking of the quality of reported emissions for listed equities and corporate bonds. As set out below, the ranking provides a potential model for data providers to communicate the quality of their data to investors. Data Quality Options to estimate the financed emissions When to use each option Score 1 Option 1: Reported emissions 1a Outstanding amount in the company and EVIC are known. Verified emissions of the company are available. Score 2 1b Outstanding amount in the company and EVIC are known. Unverified emissions of the company are available. Option 2: Physical activity-based emissions 2a Outstanding amount in the company and EVIC are known. Reported company emissions are not known. Emissions are calculated using primary physical activity data of the company\u2019s energy consumption and emission factors70 specific to that primary data. Relevant process emissions are added. Score 3 2b Outstanding amount in the company and EVIC are known. Reported company emissions are not known. Emissions are calculated using primary physical activity data of the company\u2019s production and emission factors specific to that primary data. Score 4 Option 3: Economic activity-based emissions 3a Outstanding amount in the company, EVIC, and the company\u2019s revenue are known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of revenue are known (e.g., tCO 2 e per euro or dollar of revenue earned in a sector) Score 5 3b Outstanding amount in the company is known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of asset (e.g., tCO 2 e per euro or dollar of asset in a sector) are known. 3c Outstanding amount in the company is known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of revenue (e.g., tCO 2 e per euro or dollar of revenue earned in a sector) and asset turnover ratios for the sector are known. Source: PCAF (2022), The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part A: Financed Emissions Second Edition. It is important to stress that data quality scores, such as those presented in Box 5, do not address all of the concerns of investors, as these scores tend to focus on addressing the gaps in calculation methodologies used by the company or data provider. As a result, they do not provide a strong indicator of estimation uncertainty.[39] For example, a verified emission number provided by the company (Option 1a) may be subject to significant monitoring uncertainty, whereas emissions estimates based on Option 2a could have a high degree of certainty. Similarly, it is important to recognise limitations to the scope of these quality scores, compared with the breadth of investors\u2019 portfolios. For example, the PCAF only specifies detailed data quality score tables for seven specific asset classes.[40] Issue 2: The uncertainties in climate data In practice, while emission estimates may be useful to help investors identify which companies may be the largest emitters and, hence, should be the focus of engagement, the uncertainties in emission estimation means that such data is generally of limited value when assessing the emission abatement activities of a company or in distinguishing between different companies based on their emission reduction performance. One key data point that would give investors quantitative insights on emissions data is the error range of the emissions estimate. However, none of the data providers reviewed reported publicly on these error ranges. Alternatively, a qualitative approach to addressing the uncertainty in climate data would be to use the data quality scores (above) as a proxy. However, such a proxy would be imperfect, as a high data quality score does not necessarily mean that the data is more certain. Instead, investors must consider such scores in conjunction with a wider explanation of the data. Issue 3: The methodologies used to develop climate products Here, interviewees particularly highlighted that the methodologies for implied temperature rise (ITR) metrics for companies and qualitative assessments of climate change governance are unclear. A number of interviewees noted that the utility of ITR metrics as a decision-making tool is questionable. This is due to the lack of transparency in their underlying methodologies as well as the wide variations in company temperature scores generated by different providers, due to the lack of common methodologies. However, there is significant work underway to improve the robustness of ITR methodologies and the usefulness of ITR metrics to investors.[41] Some data providers provide qualitative assessments of climate change governance, usually presented as an overall climate change governance score. Typically, these focus on an assessment of the process of managing climate change, i.e., around corporate governance of climate change, such as who is responsible for climate change, their role and skill set, and reporting structures. However, mirroring the comments made about emissions data, interviewees noted that the methods used (e.g., the factors considered and the weights given to different aspects of governance[42]) are seldom made publicly available. This means it is not possible to understand the reasons why providers offer different assessments of companies on this issue. Overall, broader regulatory developments are underway, aimed at improving transparency of the methodologies used by ESG data products. See Box 6 for an overview. Box 6. Recent regulatory developments on ESG data and ratings products The following regulatory developments are all centred around improving the transparency of ESG data and ratings products, as well as the governance of their providers, building on recommendations from the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO): IOSCO recommendations \u2013 in 2021, IOSCO called for oversight of providers and published a set of recommendations for regulators in its Final Report on ESG Ratings and data products providers. Japanese Code of Conduct \u2013 in 2022, the Japanese Financial Services Agency released a voluntary Code of Conduct for ESG Evaluation and Data Providers. Indian consultation \u2013 in February 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India published a Consultation Paper to gather feedback on a proposed regulatory framework, which includes proposals for ESG ratings providers. UK Code of Conduct \u2013 in July 2023, the ESG Data and Ratings Working Group, which was established by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, opened a consultation on its voluntary code of conduct. [43] The UK government\u2019s Treasury has also announced its intention to regulate ESG ratings providers, and was consulting on a proposed regulatory regime until June 2023. The UK government\u2019s Treasury has also announced its intention to regulate ESG ratings providers, and was consulting on a proposed regulatory regime until June 2023. EU regulation \u2013 in summer 2023, the European Commission also came forward with a legislative proposal to regulate ESG ratings providers.[44] This follows an initial consultation on the functioning of the ESG ratings market in the EU[45] and a call for evidence by the European Securities and Markets Authority.[46] Analysis of forward-looking company climate change data Carbon performance metrics like carbon footprints are generally insufficient to allow investors to determine whether or not a given company is on a credible decarbonisation path. Investors need information on forward-looking targets, and analysis of the credibility of these targets, the adequacy of the company\u2019s climate strategy and the extent to which the climate strategy and climate-related capital expenditure plans are aligned with the company\u2019s overall strategy and capital expenditure plans.[47] Some disclosure requirements have started to ask companies to disclose their capital expenditure against climate goals \u2013 see Box 7. Box 7. Corporate disclosure and the EU Taxonomy Under the EU Taxonomy, all non-financial corporates are required as of 1 January 2023 to disclose the proportion of their turnover, capital expenditure and operational expenditure that is associated with economic activities that meet the Taxonomy\u2019s screening criteria for climate change mitigation and adaptation. As the Taxonomy defines criteria for economic activities that are aligned with a net zero trajectory by 2050, this disclosure provides a measure of a company\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s climate goals. Thereby, it gives investors a proxy for the credibility of companies\u2019 climate strategies in the context of these climate goals. Several of the investors interviewed said that climate data providers do not adequately address forward-looking company climate change data. Some data providers, typically those focusing on companies in high-emitting sectors, do provide information on company emission reduction targets and on whether corporate strategy and capital expenditure are either aligned with emission reduction targets or with achieving overall climate change goals. However, few data providers currently offer views on whether a company\u2019s targets are achievable or on the dependency of the targets on other factors (e.g., policy interventions or the development of new technologies). Feedback from investors indicated that this would not necessarily require any new corporate disclosures but would rely on data providers using currently available information to produce an opinion on a company\u2019s targets. Portfolio-level metrics and methodologies Issue 1: Quality and uncertainty of portfolio-level emissions data As discussed above, there are significant gaps and uncertainties in the climate data provided to investors. Investor concerns about data quality and uncertainty equally apply where this data is aggregated up to portfolio level; it cannot be assumed that the data uncertainties cancel each other out and it cannot be assumed that comparisons between companies are reliable. In turn, this means that investors need to be careful when making decisions about which companies to invest in or when assessing the overall exposure of their portfolios to climate change-related risks and opportunities. Looking at the two approaches noted above: Qualitative: Several providers have tried to address these issues by providing information on the number of companies, or the proportion of emissions in a portfolio\/index, either where emissions have been estimated or conversely have been verified. Some data providers have gone as far as applying the PCAF quality score to some of the major global listed benchmarks. Quantitative: The research has not been able to identify any data providers who undertake a quantitative assessment of the overall uncertainty of portfolio emissions, in both absolute and relative (intensity) terms. Note, it is important to have both absolute and relative figures, as there are uncertainties to both metrics. Issue 2: Real-world emissions reductions The emissions of a portfolio or benchmark can change year on year for a variety of reasons, including: changes in company enterprise value, including cash (EVIC);[48] changes in the companies in the portfolio or benchmark; the weight of companies in a portfolio or benchmark; and the emissions associated with the companies in the portfolio or benchmark. Investors need to understand the factors that can drive changes in reported emissions. They should be able to explain changes that are due to actions taken by the entities in the portfolio and those that are due to changes in portfolio weightings; it cannot be assumed that changes in benchmark or portfolio emissions intensity reflect a decrease in real-world emissions. At present, data providers do not provide information on the drivers of changes in portfolio-related emissions.[49] Investor interviewees noted that this limits investors\u2019 ability to understand the most effective drivers of decarbonisation in their portfolios, and the role played by companies\u2019 own emission reduction and energy saving efforts. Some interviewees also said that growing concerns about greenwashing, combined with this lack of information on the drivers of change in reported emissions, have made them reluctant to make net zero commitments. A number of data providers now offer equity and corporate bond Paris-aligned or climate change portfolios or benchmarks that are based on emissions-intensity metrics.[50] However, these portfolios and benchmarks differ significantly; for example, some consider only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, whereas others include all three scopes; some exclude certain fossil fuels whereas others have no explicit exclusions; some include climate change governance whereas others do not; some include climate solutions whereas others do not. The consequence is that it is not easy for investors to compare these portfolios or benchmarks or to tell what the drivers of the (aggregate) reported changes in emissions are and, specifically, whether they are as a result of companies actually taking action to reduce their emissions. Ultimately, however, the economy-wide transition cannot occur unless companies reduce their emissions (i.e., emission reductions must occur in the real economy), and investors should be wary of chasing reductions in portfolio emissions intensity that do not deliver reductions in emissions across the economy.[51] Issue 3: Reliability and clarity of portfolio alignment metrics Approximately half of the data providers reviewed undertook aggregation of emissions up to the portfolio level and provide both total emissions and portfolio emissions intensity metrics. However, fewer than half of these appear to produce this analysis of financed emissions that reflects the capital structure of the company.[52] Similar to the commentary on company emissions, a number of data providers reviewed still appear to favour revenue-based intensity metrics and do not consider the capital structure of the company. In addition, calculated revenue-based emission intensities for different portfolios are not comparable, nor can they be easily aggregated to the fund level. A number of data providers now produce ITR metrics for portfolios. These metrics are designed to allow investors to communicate the degree of portfolio alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. A number of the investors interviewed for this research questioned how decision-useful the metric was, arguing that a balanced and complete portfolio alignment disclosure should not be reduced to a single figure and, if a single figure is to be used, then it should be accompanied by an explicit quantified uncertainty range. As with ITRs for companies (see above), there was a general lack of transparency around the methodologies being used for assessing the ITR for a portfolio and, even where methodologies are published, interviewees questioned the scientific robustness of the methods being used. They questioned: the basis for aggregating individual company ITRs;[53] whether the aggregation process recognises the need for specific geographic and sector alignment assessment of companies; and whether an ITR metric provides insights into the drivers of change within a portfolio (or of the investor\u2019s contribution to these changes). Interviewees also noted that there is wide variation in the portfolio temperature scores provided by different providers and that there is very limited information available from providers about the reliability of these scores or of the uncertainties associated with them. These insights from our research are in line with wider commentary that has been raised on ITRs (at both the company and portfolio level).[54] For example, the PRI\u2019s 2021 discussion paper, Forward Looking Climate Metrics, recognised a number of these concerns and, in addition, noted that portfolio-level measures of ITR do not account for indirect systemic risks from climate change. Ultimately, this feedback from the market led to the TCFD describing ITR as \u201ccomplex and opaque regarding influence of key assumptions\u201d.[55] Box 8 discusses some of the wider factors influencing the development of ITR metrics. Box 8. Factors influencing the development of ITR metrics Demand for ITR metrics has been stimulated by: Voluntary frameworks and guidance, such as the Portfolio Alignment Team report, which recognises ITR as one of three types of portfolio alignment tools. Regulators, like those in the UK\u2019s Department of Work and Pensions, recognising ITR as one possible way that relevant trustees in the UK could measure and report on their investment portfolios\u2019 Paris alignment. Similarly, in its Policy Statement PS21\/24, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority asks asset managers to, as far as is practicable, produce product-level TCFD reports with an ITR metric. Data providers are not the only organisations looking to develop and to support the application of ITR methodologies. For example, in November 2022, GFANZ released its Measuring Portfolio Alignment report, which sets out guidance on how ITR metrics should be calculated. For many investors, their approach to strategic asset allocation (SAA) will play an important role in their climate change strategy, and in particular their investments in climate solutions, infrastructure-type assets and developing countries. In principle at least, SAA processes can explicitly incorporate net zero objectives.[56] However, as discussed under \u2018Data coverage\u2019 (see Issue 3: Gaps in products on strategic asset allocation), the tools to incorporate net zero goals into SAA (for equities and fixed income) remain relatively underdeveloped. Common definitions Many of the investor interviewees said that inconsistencies in definitions directly contribute to the inconsistencies seen in the climate data that is available to investors. While interviewees expressed caution about over-prescriptive definitions and about stifling innovation, they pointed to three areas where common definitions \u2013 supported by investors and adopted by data providers \u2013 would be particularly helpful. Issue 1: Definition of alignment Some interviewees use external definitions of alignment (e.g., that provided by the IIGCC\u2019s Net Zero Implementation Framework[57]) whereas others have developed their own criteria to assess alignment. As a result, there is no consensus on the scope of alignment (e.g., some use Scope 1 and 2 emissions, others use Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and on the contribution that offsets and nature-based solutions can make to the wider goal of achieving net zero. The consequence is that investors are using different tools and metrics and making different demands of data providers. Using different definitions of alignment is also an issue among data providers. It means that different data providers can draw different conclusions about the alignment of a specific portfolio. However, more definitive commentary is not possible, as the use of the term within methodologies is difficult to assess using publicly available materials. (See comments above on the lack of transparency around data providers\u2019 methodologies.) Issue 2: Definition of fossil fuel reserves Data providers have good coverage of fossil fuel exposure, of current fossil fuel production and of downstream Scope 3 emissions, and these are assessed reasonably consistently across the industry. However, there is limited consistency in how fossil fuel reserves are assessed or reported. One indicator that interviewees broadly agreed the investment industry could use was proven and probable reserves, or 3P (i.e., proven, probable and possible) reserves.[58] Issue 3: Definition of climate solutions Different providers define climate solutions in different ways. Many do not publicly disclose the definitions that they use for identifying climate solutions, nor do they explain how their definitions compare to frameworks such as the EU Taxonomy. Initiatives like the NZAOA and groups like GFANZ have started to look to define this term (see Box 9), but these definitions have not yet been adopted universally. Box 9. Defining climate solutions The NZAOA\u2019s Target Setting Protocol (3rd edition, Jan 2023) defines \u201cclimate solution investments\u201d as \u201cinvestments in economic activities considered to contribute to climate change mitigation (including transition enabling) and adaptation, in alignment with existing climate-related sustainability taxonomies and other generally acknowledged climate-related frameworks.\u201d This was developed by taking into account publicly available definitions, to improve consistency across the Alliance\u2019s membership in assessing climate solutions. In its Recommendations and Guidance on Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans, GFANZ defines climate solutions as: \u201cTechnologies, services, tools, or social and behavioural changes that directly contribute to the elimination, removal, or reduction of real-economy GHG emissions or that directly support the expansion of these solutions. These solutions include scaling up zero-carbon alternatives to high-emitting activities \u2013 a prerequisite to phasing out high emitting assets \u2013 as well as nature-based solutions and carbon removal technologies.\u201d Sector and geographic pathways When assessing company performance against net zero by 2050, investors generally need to look beyond global science-based pathways (or broad-brush assessments of the rate of decarbonisation required) and look at sector- and geography-specific transition pathways. The importance of these pathways was particularly emphasised by investor interviewees in the context of developing countries or emerging markets, where nationally determined contributions (NDCs) define the country\u2019s net zero trajectory.[59] However, further work is needed to develop these country- and sector-specific pathways and to make them widely available to the investment community. Interviewees suggested that investors should work with global sector representatives or industry transition pathway initiatives to develop these pathways. Interviewees said their development should be underpinned by an agreed set of principles, including a just transition, and the recognition of country- and sector-specific technology development pathways.[60] While there are initiatives that are working on sectoral decarbonisation pathways (Box 10), their focus has been on benchmarks for high-emitting sectors (with the Transition Pathway Initiative) and on high-level principles (with the GFANZ Guidance); these initiatives also do not go as far as to discuss issues like just transition principles, regional differences between pathways or (more generally) geographic pathways. Box 10. Guidance on sectoral decarbonisation pathways Sectoral decarbonisation pathways generally rely on research on carbon budgets and sectoral allocations, using a range of scenarios. Examples include: The Global Energy and Climate Model [61] from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which is the agency\u2019s key model for the development of sector- (and region-)specific pathways, with multiple scenarios (e.g., Net Zero by 2050) for different sectors. from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which is the agency\u2019s key model for the development of sector- (and region-)specific pathways, with multiple scenarios (e.g., Net Zero by 2050) for different sectors. A report from the Institute for Sustainable Futures University of Technology Sydney (UTS) on sectoral pathways.[62] It defines the Global One Earth Climate Model (OECM) 1.5\u00b0C Pathway and sectoral pathways for seven sectors. This research informs initiatives focusing on the development of sectoral decarbonisation pathways for financial institutions: The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) has defined sectoral decarbonisation pathways, [63] with the latest material released in February 2022. The work sets out emissions benchmarks in 10 high-emitting sectors, against three scenarios. TPI\u2019s pathways are derived from the modelling produced by the IEA. with the latest material released in February 2022. The work sets out emissions benchmarks in 10 high-emitting sectors, against three scenarios. TPI\u2019s pathways are derived from the modelling produced by the IEA. GFANZ released guidance to support financial institutions\u2019 use of sectoral pathways[64] in June 2022. It provides a high-level overview of what a pathway should look like (including design principles, such as that they should be comparable, granular, credible etc.). GFANZ focuses on five cross-sectoral pathways to illustrate how the framework can be applied: those from the IEA, UTS and modellers supporting the development of climate scenarios for the Network for Greening the Financial System. 4. What action can be taken? Our analysis compares investor data needs against the climate data available from a representative sample of data providers. From this analysis, the research has identified three areas of the data ecosystem that might be strengthened to better support investors with the delivery of their net zero commitments (see Figure 7). We recommend that data providers, companies and policy makers and regulators work to: Improve corporate disclosure \u2013 as corporate data underpins the majority of data products that are currently available, improving corporate disclosure is a pre-requisite to improve the coverage and quality of data products. Improve coverage and quality of products \u2013 there is a need for data providers to improve coverage, data provider transparency, forward-looking analysis of climate data, and portfolio-level metrics and methodologies. Facilitate data comparability \u2013 wider consensus-building activities are needed to establish common definitions and agreement on sector and geographic pathways. These would, over time, feed back into the development of data products. Figure 7. Summary of recommendations The table below outlines the full set of recommendations identified in the research, grouped by theme. While the recommendations are designed to stand alone, there are clearly overlaps and dependencies, and progress on some would be easier if others were implemented first (e.g., some of the recommendations on data quality first require companies to improve their reporting). It is also important to acknowledge that a number of initiatives are already working on some of the recommendations in this report, such as the NZFSPA.[65] In addition, a number of data providers have started to offer or are designing products that respond to these recommendations. While there are clear signs of industry engagement and progress, there remains a pressing need for general agreement, consistent implementation and development of tools and methodologies to meet investors\u2019 data needs to support their net zero commitments. Theme Recommendations Improve corporate disclosure I. Coverage and quality of climate data Standard-setters and regulators should introduce mandatory climate disclosure through rules and laws for public and private companies. In particular, these rules and laws should require: Implementation and disclosure against globally applicable corporate sustainability disclosure standards, rules and laws, with emissions disclosed on an ownership (equity) basis and against the following metrics and targets: Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, including a breakdown by GHG and with Scope 3 emissions split into upstream and downstream emissions. The proportion of emissions that are (a) measured directly (including details of the measurements), and (b) estimated including details of the calculation methodologies and the assumptions underpinning these estimates. The proportion of the emissions that have been verified, including details of the verification process. Changes to GHG emissions. Companies should separate out the changes resulting from each of (i) the company\u2019s own emissions abatement actions (e.g., purchasing renewable energy, implementing energy or resource efficiency initiatives); (ii) changes in the emissions intensity of the electricity grid; (iii) changes in production or activity levels; and (iv) acquisitions or divestments. Emissions targets, which should be expressed in both absolute and relative (i.e., intensity) terms, with these targets being set for one, five and 10 years into the future, with the proportion of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions covered by the targets and the proposed strategy to meet the targets. The disclosure of industry metrics and corresponding targets for the 12 most energy-intensive sectors; which should include Scope 1, Scope 2 and significant Scope 3 emissions, capturing current data as well as data on a forward-looking basis (at five- and 10-year intervals). [66] Publication of transition plans, describing how companies intend to align their business models with net zero by 2050. Improve coverage and quality of products I. Coverage of data products Data providers should extend their coverage, in particular in relation to: Emerging markets Smaller companies (equity and debt) Private equity Fixed income, outside of corporate bonds (e.g., sovereigns and structured products) Where needed, investors, investor-backed net zero initiatives and data providers should work together to develop climate data reporting and assessment methodologies for asset classes where such methodologies are needed (e.g., private debt (outside of private loans) and non-corporate fixed income). II. Data provider transparency Data providers should ensure that they: Disclose the source(s) of entity-level emissions data and the reporting year to which the emissions relate. Provide ownership-based emissions data. If it is not possible to provide this information, the data provider should explain the basis on which the emissions data is provided. Disclose the quality score for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for each entity, such as using the PCAF quality score or, where PCAF scores are not available, other credible, recognised quality scores. Disclose the uncertainty in emission estimates. Note: providing a quality score is not sufficient to meet this recommendation. Disclose the methodologies used for estimating current and future emissions, including details of the assumptions used, the data or data sources used for developing correlations, when correlations were updated, and the uncertainties associated with the methodologies and the data. Disclose the methodologies, data and assumptions used for assessing climate change governance. Provide a detailed explanation (including details of the scientific rationale) for company and portfolio alignment assessment methodologies, in particular for ITR metrics. III. Analysis of forward-looking company climate change data Data providers should provide products that analyse: The credibility of company emission targets, identifying the main factors that will determine whether such targets are likely to be reached. The alignment of a company\u2019s strategy with the company\u2019s emission reduction targets and climate change strategy. The abatement cost curves for companies\u2019 emission reduction strategies for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. IV. Portfolio-level metrics and methodologies Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives, in conjunction with data providers and other service providers, should: Develop methodologies that enable investors to report on portfolio and\/or fund-level real-world emission reductions and net zero alignment. Assess changes in portfolio emissions and emissions intensities due to different factors, including from changes in EVIC (in line with the PCAF recommendations). Assess the overall uncertainty of portfolios\u2019 emissions, in both absolute and relative (intensity) terms. Analyse and report on the reasons underpinning changes in portfolio-level emissions and emission intensities. This should include an explicit discussion of the influence of each of the following on changes in reported emissions and emissions intensities: (i) changes in company EVIC; (ii) new or divested positions; (iii) changes in entity weights; and (iv) changes in absolute emissions. Disclose the methodology, scientific basis and uncertainty of investment and portfolio ITR assessments. Develop tools to integrate the goals of net zero into SAA at the portfolio or fund level. Facilitate data comparability I. Common definitions Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives should: Adopt a common definition of alignment for companies and other entities. The definition should explicitly cover all of a company\u2019s activities and emissions (i.e., Scopes 1, 2 and 3), should specify the climate scenarios to be used in making such assessments and should clarify the role that activities such as offsets and nature-based solutions play in the assessment of alignment. Develop and agree a common definition to assess and report fossil fuel reserves. For example, proven, probable and possible fossil fuel reserves (3P), to assess a fossil fuel-exposed company\u2019s total future Category 11 Scope 3 emissions. Develop and implement a set of principles, or definitions, to be used by data providers for identifying climate solutions. Engage with data providers to adopt these three definitions, and to ensure that the data and information provided is aligned with them. II. Sector and geographic pathways Investor-backed net zero frameworks and initiatives should: Agree on a set of principles by which geographic and sector-specific transition pathways are developed. These should include the core principles that: (i) pathways are consistent with meeting the emission reductions required by a global science-based target; and (ii) just transition principles are considered as they apply to countries or regions. Agree on specific geographic and high-impact sector transition pathways. Engage with data providers to encourage them to use the specific geographic and high-impact sector transition pathways for assessing company alignment. Appendix 1. Summary of research approach Framework analysis The requirements of 17 of the most prominent and widely adopted investor-focused climate initiatives were reviewed for this report. The initiatives were: Three sector-wide strategic forums \u2013 The UN\u2019s Race to Zero Campaign, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII). Four commitment-based initiatives \u2013 Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance (NZAOA), Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI), Paris Aligned Asset Owners and the Climate Action 100+. Two disclosure frameworks \u2013 the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework for Financial Institutions and the PRI\u2019s Reporting and Assessment Framework. Eight tools and guidance to help investors implement their commitments \u2013 the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol, the Science Based Target initiative\u2019s (SBTi\u2019s) Science-based Targets Guidance for Financial Institutions, the PAII\u2019s Net Zero Investment Framework, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment, the Investor Climate Action Plan Expectation Ladder, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change\u2019s Net Zero Stewardship Toolkit and the Initiative Climat International\u2019s Case for Net Zero. Data provider analysis The products offered by the following 19 climate data providers were reviewed between September and October 2022: 2DII Baringa\/Blackrock Bloomberg Carbon4 Finance CDP CRREM FTSE Russell\/LSEG Germanwatch GRESB Inrate ISS Linux Foundation Morningstar \/ Morningstar Sustainalytics Moody\u2019s MSCI SENSES Solactive TPI S&P Global These providers include ESG data providers with climate products, climate index providers, scenario analysis providers, alignment assessment providers, and other specialist climate data providers. They represent a cross-section of the market, including a combination of large and more boutique data providers, and offer a range of types of products (e.g., climate products, climate indexes and scenario analysis products). In total, the research reviewed 62 climate change-related products, primarily focusing on data or services needed to assist asset managers or owners with net zero strategies.[67] The research had two steps: We started with an initial desk review in September 2022 of 28 data providers, using publicly disclosed information about each provider\u2019s products and services to understand the nature of the products (i.e., whether they were relevant for the assessment of real-world emissions reductions), their geographic and asset class coverage, as well as specifics about the granularity of the products and services. For example, the research assessed the number of products that provide current and forward-looking climate data at different levels of aggregation (i.e., asset-level, fund-level and portfolio-level). Between September and October 2022, the analysis was sent to the screened data providers for review and fact-checking, and we revised our analysis based on the feedback received. There are three limitations to the scope of the research. First, it did not consider, in detail, data or services associated with climate change physical risk assessment. Secondly, it did not consider, in detail, data or services associated with climate change investment risk and products to support TCFD scenario analysis and reporting. Thirdly, it did not cover all organisations providing climate data to asset owners and asset managers and the initial screening relied on what was publicly reported, although we are of the view that the research captured a representative cross-section of the providers and the products on the market as of October 2022. As this research is a landscape review of the market for data products on net zero alignment at a specific point in time, the recommendations: (i) do not comment on any particular data provider or product; and (ii) recognise that the market continues to develop new products and services. To ensure that the overall recommendations remained valid, we engaged with the following nine data providers in April and May 2023 to test the key findings and recommendations of the project: Bloomberg Clarity AI FTSE Russell\/LSEG GRESB Minerva Analytics Morningstar \/ Morningstar Sustainalytics Moody\u2019s MSCI S&P Global Investor interviews Ten asset owners and six asset managers were interviewed for this report about their climate objectives. These investors were from different geographies, managed or focused on different asset classes, and varied in size, as approximated by assets under management. The interviews, held in October and November 2022, covered their data needs and their perspectives on what improvements are required in the climate data market. A breakdown of the geographic location of the asset owners and asset managers interviewed is given in Figure A. Figure A. Geographic location of investors interviewed The investors interviewed varied in terms of the commitments they had made. While all asset owners interviewed had made a net zero commitment, only six were NZAOA signatories. Five of the asset owners had set portfolio-level targets and six had set sector-specific targets. Some of those that set sector-specific or portfolio-level targets were not NZAOA signatories. Relatively few had set targets for climate solutions (see Figure B). Figure B. Types of commitments made by asset owner interviewees Of the six asset managers interviewed, five were NZAMI signatories and most had set portfolio-level targets. All except one had set other types of targets (Figure C). Figure C. Types of commitments set by asset manager interviewees This appendix summarises the initiatives, tools and guidance reviewed for this report (Table A) and maps the tools and guidance to investors\u2019 requirements, where this has not been captured in the main body of the report (Table B). Table A. Summary of initiatives, tools and guidance reviewed Name Brief description of the initiative, tool or guidance Key requirements for investors Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) CA100+ is an investor-led initiative focused on decarbonising corporate emissions. The centrepiece of CA100+ is its Net Zero Company Benchmark, which assesses how over 100 of the world\u2019s largest corporate emitters are performing on climate. The Net Zero Company Benchmark is primarily used by investors as an engagement tool. Investor signatories can participate in CA100+ in a number of ways. Signatories can join as lead or collaborating investors, which come with corporate engagement responsibilities, as individual entities, or as supporters (which do not have engagement responsibilities). Signatories participating in company engagements represent only the assets over which they have a fiduciary duty in these engagements. Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) GFANZ is a sector-wide strategic forum that brings together seven financial alliances including: the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, and Paris Aligned Asset Owners. The seven constituent net zero alliances have each established membership criteria that have been approved by the UN\u2019s Race to Zero. GFANZ does not have specific requirements itself. Members are required to meet the requirements set out by the relevant net zero alliance. ICAP Expectation Ladder The Expectation Ladder provides voluntary guidance for investors seeking to develop and implement a climate strategy in line with a net zero emissions economy. The Expectation Ladder has five focus areas: (1) aligning investment strategies with net zero, (2) ensuring that portfolio companies are on their way to net zero through engagement practices, (3) supporting net zero policy through advocacy, (4) demonstrating transparency through disclosure, and (5) developing strong governance processes to ensure that climate strategies can be effectively implemented. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change\u2019s Net Zero Stewardship Toolkit The Toolkit provides guidance for investors who want to align their stewardship and engagement practices with their net zero goal. The Toolkit recommends that investors engage with companies to set net zero goals and develop and implement credible transition plans. It also provides guidance on how investors can hold companies accountable. Initiative Climat International (iCI) Case for Net Zero The iCI\u2019s report on A Case for Net Zero in Private Equity sets out guidance on why private equity firms should set net zero targets and how they should act to drive this action within portfolio companies. The report provides a roadmap for members to follow towards a net zero trajectory. It begins with an initial phase to commit and learn about integrating net zero, before moving on to a second phase of engaging with portfolio companies, which progressively raises iCI members\u2019 ambitions. Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMI) NZAMI is an alliance of asset managers committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and to implementing investment and engagement practices aligned with this goal. To join the initiative, asset managers must make a number of commitments around net zero, including setting targets to decarbonise their portfolios. Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) NZAOA is an alliance of asset owners committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and implementing investment and engagement practices aligned with this goal. To join the initiative, asset owner signatories must make a number of commitments around net zero, including setting targets to decarbonise their portfolios. NZAOA Target Setting Protocol The Alliance Target Setting Protocol sets out the NZAOA\u2019s approach to target setting and reporting. The Alliance Commitment requires its members to publish interim targets on a five-year cycle. The Protocol covers the setting of these targets in four areas: Engagement with companies Portfolio targets for listed equity and debt High emissions sectors Climate solutions investment Net Zero Investment Framework (NZIF) NZIF provides guidance for a broad range of investors, including asset owners and asset managers, on how to set and implement credible commitments to achieving net zero emissions across their portfolios. NZIF is also a tool to guide asset managers in implementing the commitments they have made as part of NZAMI. The NZIF framework recommends that investors take action across six focus areas: (1) strategy setting, (2) target setting, (3) strategic asset allocation, (4) asset class alignment, (5) policy advocacy, and (6) market engagement. Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO) Initiative PAAO is an international group of asset owners committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 or sooner. PAAO signatories have made a voluntary commitment to deliver against a 10-point net zero commitment statement, in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties. At the heart of the commitment statement is the goal to transition their investments to achieve net zero portfolio GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner, and support emissions reductions in the real economy. Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) PACTA is a free, open-source methodology and tool, which measures equity and corporate bond portfolio alignment with various climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. PACTA focuses on \u201cclimate-relevant\u201d sectors within a portfolio. It currently covers power, coal mining, oil and gas upstream sectors, auto manufacturing, cement, steel and aviation, with the shipping industry to be added soon. Collectively, these sectors account for about 75% of global GHG emissions. Paris Aligned Investment Initiative (PAII) The PAII is a collaborative investor-led global forum enabling investors to align their portfolios and activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement. PAII itself does not have any specific requirements but helps support the delivery of the net zero commitments made under the PAAO. Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry The PCAF Reporting Standard provides guidance to measure and disclose financed GHG emissions associated with seven asset classes: listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, project finance, commercial real estate, mortgages, motor vehicle loans and sovereign debt. The PCAF provides a standardised GHG accounting approach for financed GHG emissions measurement and disclosure, with specific guidance depending on asset class. The standard provides guidance on data quality scoring per asset class, facilitating data transparency, and a minimum disclosure threshold for emissions. The PRI\u2019s Reporting and Assessment (R&A) Framework The R&A framework enables PRI asset owner and investment manager signatories to report annually on their activities. The framework is mandatory for PRI signatories. PRI\u2019s R&A is broken down into modules, with signatories reporting on the compulsory modules as well as the asset-specific modules relevant to them. This includes reporting on governance processes, climate risk, emissions, target setting and engagement activities. In addition, there is a voluntary sustainable outcomes module, which provides an opportunity for signatories to report on setting targets on sustainable outcomes (including climate). The Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) Financial Sector Science-based Targets Guidance The SBTi\u2019s Targets Guidance is a target-setting protocol that provides guidance to help financial institutions set credible net zero targets. In particular, it is one of the three target-setting guidance documents that NZAMI signatories can report their targets against. SBTi\u2019s framework recommends that financial institutions (including investors) take several steps to set credible targets. These include conducting a GHG inventory, tracking and disclosing progress, and engaging with companies, policy makers and service providers. The framework also provides recommendations about the coverage, timelines and alignment methodology used to set a target. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) The recommendations of the TCFD are a set of disclosure guidelines to be used by companies and financial-sector organisations on how to report their climate-related risks and opportunities in a consistent manner. The TCFD provides recommendations on disclosures relating to climate governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. UN\u2019s Race to Zero campaign The Race to Zero campaign is a coalition of leading net zero initiatives, across a wide range of sectors, from businesses to cities to financial initiatives. The financial initiatives that are partner members are: (1) the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, (2) the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and (3) the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative. To participate in the Race to Zero campaign, initiatives must fulfil minimum criteria, including committing to reach net zero emissions, setting and disclosing progress against interim targets, and aligning external policy and engagement with net zero. Figure 3 maps the above initiatives, tools and guidance for initiatives and disclosure frameworks against the requirements identified by the investor initiatives.

BCG has studied the energy transition in depth to build a blueprint that outlines ways to scale new low-carbon technologies, the global implications of the shift, and critical actions that policymakers, energy users, infrastructure providers, energy producers, and investors can take to move the needle. Over the coming months, we will publish a series of articles exploring many of these topics in greater detail. A Tectonic Shift Failure to bend the curve dramatically on emissions will have steep costs for the natural world and for the health and livelihoods of people around the globe. Evidence of these impacts becomes clearer every day\u2014and at a concerning pace. We have the tools to get to net zero, but we do not have the policies, proven business cases, and capabilities in place everywhere to massively accelerate the pace of action. All stakeholders, private and public, need to do their part to effectively unlock concrete progress. Energy is a fundamental driver of economic growth and human prosperity. Society must massively accelerate substitution and abatement of fossil fuel use. We have the technological levers to get us to a net zero energy system. Oil and gas must be phased down rapidly, but selective investments will still be necessary. Access full blueprint Energy is a fundamental driver of economic growth and human prosperity. A strong correlation exists between energy access and human prosperity. Nations with \u201cvery high human development\u201d (a Human Development Index above 0.8) consume more than 20 MWh of primary energy per capita. Fortunately, we can do more with less energy: over the past three decades, the global energy intensity of GDP has decreased by 34%. Further improvements in energy efficiency are critical, while energy access in developing economies must expand. Society must massively accelerate substitution and abatement of fossil fuel use. Fossil fuels represent 80% of energy use and 70% to 75% of GHG emissions globally; coal alone produces over 25% of global emissions. Renewables must rise from 12% of energy supply in 2021 to 50% to 70% by 2050. Solar and wind generation capacity must increase tenfold, and global electric grids must expand by 2.5x\u2014with similar investment levels in both areas. We must also abate emissions from remaining use of fossil fuels, including methane emissions. We have the technological levers to get us to a net zero energy system. Through 2030, proven technologies such as energy efficiency, electrification of end uses, solar photovoltaics, and wind are mainstays of the transition. In the 2030s, emerging technologies\u2014including grid-scale batteries; new types of nuclear reactors; low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage\u2014will scale, given the right investment and effort. Meanwhile, significant investment in direct air capture is critical in this decade to lower its costs in the decades to come. Longer term, big bets such as fusion could be game changers. Oil and gas must be phased down rapidly, but selective investments will still be necessary. We must swiftly phase out coal. However, most net zero scenarios call for oil and gas supply in 2030 equivalent to 50% to 80% of 2021 supply and 15% to 30% in 2050\u2014particularly for fuel use in hard-to-abate sectors and as feedstock in petrochemicals. Current productive assets will not meet 2030 demand and beyond. We must create conditions that ensure selective investment in the development of the most affordable, least GHG-intensive oil and gas volumes. The Far-Reaching Implications The energy transition is critical to preserving a livable planet. It will also drive major economic change\u2014altering the economics of energy systems and markets and remaking the global competitive landscape. But if we successfully accelerate the transition, we can expand access to electricity and greater prosperity to the 775 million people who don\u2019t have either today\u2014and enable the even larger number of people who use very small amounts of electricity today to increase their usage.","filter_flag":1}

By Jeffrey D. Corbin, Meghan A. Duffy, Jacquelyn L. Gill and Carly Ziter This story was originally published by AGU\u2019s Eos magazine. The Realities of Climate Anxiety Students in an ecology of urban environments course at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, plant a campus garden, the outcome of a final project in collaboration with the university\u2019s Office of Sustainability. Student projects were guided by the climate goals of the university\u2019s Sustainability Action Plan and focused on emissions reduction (e.g., through reduced lawn maintenance) and climate change adaptation (e.g., increased vegetation cover to reduce urban heat). Credit: Sarah O\u2019Driscoll The urgency of the climate crisis grows every year; meanwhile, disinformation and politicization have made communicating the science of climate change increasingly challenging. For the past 2 decades, such communication efforts have focused mainly on convincing people that climate change is real while also combating organized campaigns of denialism [Mann, 2012]. These efforts have largely succeeded: Polls show that the public now overwhelmingly accepts the reality of climate change. In one recent example in the United States, Leiserowitz et al. [2022] found that three-quarters of those surveyed were \u201calarmed,\u201d \u201cconcerned,\u201d or \u201ccautious\u201d about climate change, whereas fewer than 20% were \u201cdismissive\u201d or \u201cdoubtful.\u201d So although challenging climate change denial may still be necessary in some contexts, scientists, educators, and others who communicate about climate science face a new challenge: the clear gap between the public\u2019s concern over climate disruptions and its understanding of what can be done today to affect our tomorrow. We must better convey to audiences the needed changes\u2014in energy sources and land use, for example\u2014and that humanity can, indeed, influence the scale of disruptions that unfold [Marris, 2021; Mann, 2021]. It is time to reorient our messaging, focusing less on predictions of future hazards as though they are foregone conclusions and instead communicating a \u201chopeful alarm\u201d that simultaneously stresses the urgency of the situation and instills a sense of agency in guiding the future. Students are a vital demographic to reach as we shift the prevailing messaging of climate communication. Not only do they represent the next generations who must face the challenges of climate change, but also when they are surveyed, students and younger people generally profess concern about the issue and interest in climate action at higher rates than older segments of the population. Indeed, young people, including many of our own students, are hungry for information: In a 2023 survey, for example, 30% of U.S. teenagers expressed an interest in learning more about jobs related to sustainability and climate change. Meanwhile, hiring for \u201cgreen jobs\u201d has already been outpacing overall hiring in recent years, and transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy is forecast to generate millions of jobs in the coming decades. Educators and climate communicators can help meet these demands and empower students by providing specific examples of useful actions and relevant tools and opportunities to help them act constructively. The Hopeful Alarm Approach We must be a beacon of hope, because if you tell people there\u2019s nothing they can do, they will do worse than nothing. Margaret Atwood, The Year of the Flood If hopeful alarm sounds like Pollyannaism, rest assured it is not. We can communicate the seriousness of potential perils to humanity and nature from climate change while also offering examples and resources that model constructive engagement, much as a physician would communicate the urgency of a cancer diagnosis while outlining a path forward. That is not heedlessly optimistic\u2014rather, it is simply pragmatic. Worry, not fear, has been shown to encourage protective, adaptive behaviors [Marx et al., 2007]. Despair and hopelessness, meanwhile, have been documented to lead to \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d and to sap motivation to act\u2014indeed, fossil fuel interests deliberately promulgate widespread cynicism and \u201cdoomism\u201d among the public as a strategy to prevent meaningful action [Coan et al., 2021]. Any message of hopeful alarm should begin by emphasizing that people have agency, both individually and collectively, to shape the future. The die is not cast: Any actions that reduce carbon emissions today will improve our future, and there are not just two possible outcomes\u2014success or failure. Instead, there is a continuum of potential outcomes, and where we land along that continuum depends on decisions we make now and in the years to come. Technologies and policies with the potential to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions and greatly moderate the consequences of climate change exist [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2023]. Adaptation measures can also be undertaken so that future impacts are more manageable. Yet it is rare that these messages are presented clearly to the public. Implementing these technologies, policies, and measures will be difficult and likely involve discussions, negotiations, and, ultimately, widespread buy-in, not only from lawmakers but also from the public. But if much of the public isn\u2019t aware of the options available for dealing with the climate crisis, how are the needed conversations even to begin? As a part of the effort to broadcast hopeful alarm, educators should reconsider climate-related content in their courses. For example, how much focus is put on messages like \u201cClimate change is happening, and it is serious\u201d versus \u201cHere are solutions and ways to get involved\u201d? We argue that in most curricula, not enough time is devoted to discussing solutions and, especially, to providing students with examples of productive action on behalf of the climate to inspire their own participation. Bringing Climate Action into the Classroom Many options exist by which educators can incorporate discussions of climate action into courses of different sizes, durations, and levels (see sidebar). Even single class sessions that include sharing examples of role models and mitigation actions can make a difference for students. One of the easiest, yet still impactful, ways to broaden presentations of climate change is to highlight people and institutions involved in climate action: for example, activists influencing public policy, entrepreneurs bringing new products to market, and municipalities building climate resilience. Courtesy: Eos\/CC Among the individuals we highlight are Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, whose identification with the evangelical Christian community resonates with a particular segment of students. We share resources such as the edited volume All We Can Save [Johnson and Wilkinson, 2020] and the Not Too Late project to help show the range of people involved in climate solutions, and we encourage students to participate in youth movements such as Zero Hour and the Sunrise Movement. We also describe steps that local municipalities have taken, such as instituting climate action plans and projects to confront flooding risks exacerbated by extreme weather and sea level rise. Classroom discussions of these individuals, movements, and institutions can be tailored to a wide variety of audiences, including students in many non-STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields such as business, sociology, and even the arts. Such stories are empowering and breed a willingness to engage [Sabherwal et al., 2021]. Instructors can offer students more in-depth analysis of how carbon emissions can be targeted. For example, students can evaluate carbon-emitting activities and consider how those activities could be more efficient. Project Drawdown, which highlights dozens of specific actions across a range of sectors that reduce emissions or enhance natural carbon sinks, and Project EDDIE, which provides curricular modules and teaching activities (e.g., exploring green roofs as a solution to climate-induced precipitation increases), are great resources from which to draw. Instructors can also emphasize the rapid growth in emissions-reducing technologies using business-focused analyses to counter perceptions that controlling carbon emissions is dependent solely on government largess. In courses in which more time is available to focus on climate action (e.g., in courses featuring supplemental laboratory sessions), students could investigate climate action plans and emissions data from their own campuses to determine where cuts could be made or propose initiatives to reduce emissions. We have, for example, directed students to calculate campus carbon emissions related to electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation. They can also compare the energy provided via conventional versus renewable sources. Such projects make discussions of carbon emissions more concrete because they are centered around students\u2019 own experiences while also giving them valuable tools of analysis and even policy action. The activities described above are largely directed at undergraduate and graduate students, but they can also be undertaken in secondary school classrooms and laboratories. Many, if not all, of them support education standards related to analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing solutions. In addition, the National Center for Science Education offers a \u201cClimate Super Solutions\u201d module for grade 9\u201312 classes that supports various Earth and space sciences core ideas. Simulations and Service Learning Educators can engage students in immersive simulation exercises that illustrate emissions policies and their consequences. For example, in Climate Interactive\u2019s World Climate Simulation, students act as climate negotiators representing one of six major nations or nation blocs at a United Nations conference where the goal is to reach an agreement that keeps global average temperature increases \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d above the preindustrial average. Students carrying out a World Climate Simulation review briefing papers with information about their bloc\u2019s economic and emissions profiles and negotiation goals before adopting any of a variety of pledges to control future emissions and deforestation. Pledges are entered into the associated C-ROADS climate simulator, which provides real-time feedback on how the pledges will affect future climate. The simulation activity usually involves multiple rounds of negotiations among the different blocs, in which participants refine their pledges and develop a deeper understanding of the timelines and commitments necessary to achieve the climate goal and of the competing interests among countries. Surveys of more than 2,000 participants in the World Climate Simulation have shown that it effectively promotes feelings of both urgency and hope among participants, as well as an intent to learn more and a desire to act [Rooney-Varga et al., 2018]. Our own experience is that the simulations are engaging, lively sessions that result in realistic and unpredictable outcomes. Internships and service learning opportunities can be among the most impactful experiences for students. Instructors can help by publicizing and helping students pursue such experiences. Students who work directly in city or state agency offices, organizations, or companies that do local and regional work on climate solutions, emissions reductions, and mitigation planning gain valuable connections for future employment and action. They also gain an understanding of how concrete policies can make a difference in real-world settings [Coleman et al., 2017]. Seeing how such internships have influenced students\u2019 future career paths has been among our most rewarding mentoring experiences. Finally, educators should encourage students to share with others what they\u2019ve learned about the urgency of climate change and about ways to combat it. For example, students can email or write postcards to local stakeholders or decision-makers about the need for action. We also encourage students to view themselves as \u201cnerd nodes,\u201d or trusted sources on science for people in their networks [Willingham, 2013], and to begin conversations with family members and others in their community about climate change. To help in this effort, we point them to valuable science communication resources (e.g., this piece on how to talk about COVID-19) to help them think about how best to frame their message. Students have reported feeling empowered to talk with people outside of class about what they have learned and how rewarding that experience was. Courtesy: Getty Images via Canva From Empowerment to Action All educators hope that their students and audiences internalize what they learn so they can apply the knowledge beyond the classroom. For those of us who educate about climate change, it is especially imperative that we motivate students to act constructively with respect to the climate crisis. The concept of hopeful alarm reflects the rapid and dramatic shift in public attitudes about climate change in recent years. Instead of asking whether climate change is real and why it matters, many people\u2014notably students and young people\u2014now ask, \u201cIs there any hope?\u201d and \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Hopeful alarm provides a framework for answering those questions through positive, motivating messaging. The scale of the climate challenge is vast, so the entr\u00e9e to action can be overwhelming. Students benefit from exposure to specific, practical examples of actions and role models as well as from their own experiences with getting involved. By providing these examples and facilitating these experiences, we highlight clear pathways and equip those most likely to act on behalf of the climate with the tools they need to be successful.

Please see our new Insights to Impact page for our latest, ongoing weekly briefings. Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #64, September 28, 2023 Today\u2019s global disruption could see Asia emerging as an increasingly prominent player in myriad spheres. This week, a McKinsey report examines Asia on the cusp of a new era. Elsewhere, an article looks at potential applications of generative AI (gen AI) for corporate and investment banking. And an analysis outlines bold moves companies can make during the net-zero transition\u2014even in the face of potential headwinds. A report from the McKinsey Global Institute explores complexities that could arise for Asia as it assumes a position of strength in a new global era. Senior partners Chris Bradley, Kweilin Ellingrud, Gautam Kumra, Nick Leung, Jonathan Woetzel, and coauthors say that Asia could enjoy growing influence while also facing heightened challenges across five domains: trade (where Asia is a major player but also a center of potential tension), technology (which could shift focus beyond the areas in which Asia currently excels), demography (as aging becomes an acute issue for some Asian populations), the net-zero transition (given the region\u2019s large industrial base and surging energy demands), and capital (where Asia\u2019s lower returns and significant capital demands could create economic stresses). Corporate and investment bankers were pioneers in the applied use of AI, adopting the technology decades ago. Now, say senior partner Jared Moon and coauthors, wholesale banks could benefit from using newly emerging generative AI. Gen AI\u2019s ability to comprehend previously published documents and to create first drafts of new content could be put to use by, for instance, sorting through regulatory reports and then drafting synopses for senior officers. Among the banking contexts in which gen AI has tremendous potential: sales and marketing, risk assessment, pricing, and customer service. As the net-zero transition unfolds, companies can play offense even amid uncertainty. With $9 trillion to $12 trillion in annual sales potentially up for grabs by 2030, the rewards could be significant. Senior partners Laura Corb, Tomas Naucl\u00e9r, Daniel Pacthod, and coauthor urge companies to take six actions that will position them to succeed when conditions clarify: push ahead on value creation, integrate cost and carbon reductions, forge winning customer partnerships, update portfolios, build and scale new green businesses, and execute at digital speed. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: The case study collection Rewired in Action illuminates companies that have launched digital transformations to build value. Supported by technical and industry expertise from McKinsey, these organizations have changed their trajectories through the integration of digital and AI. A recent edition of Author Talks features Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer Matt Abrahams speaking about his new book, Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You\u2019re Put on the Spot (Simon & Schuster, September 2023). Abrahams encourages nervous speakers to craft \u201canxiety management plans\u201d but says there are only three proven ways to get better at communication: repetition, reflection, and feedback. This briefing note, based on McKinsey\u2019s latest published insights, was prepared by Seth Stevenson, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s New York office. Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #63, September 21, 2023 Simultaneously addressing poverty and climate change could involve both synergies and trade-offs. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. The dual challenge of raising global living standards while reducing global carbon emissions could create tensions most deeply felt by the Earth\u2019s poorest populations. This week, a McKinsey report quantifies the resources that might be required to close economic empowerment gaps while also setting the world on a path to net zero. Elsewhere, a survey reveals that investors are demanding more clarity regarding companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\u2013related efforts. And an interview with Walmart\u2019s chief sustainability officer looks at the retailer\u2019s quest to become \u201cregenerative.\u201d A report from the McKinsey Global Institute examines the potential for accelerated economic growth to simultaneously raise the world\u2019s living standards and limit global warming. These twin goals are intertwined in complex ways: newly empowered populations might increasingly demand more emissions-intensive products and services, but these populations are also often most vulnerable to climate-related risks. McKinsey analysis suggests that the combined investment to close both empowerment and net-zero gaps could amount to 8 percent of global GDP annually over the next decade. Senior partners Kweilin Ellingrud, Tracy Francis, Sven Smit, Jonathan Woetzel, and coauthors say that businesses and the market economy could be capable of generating half these required resources through growth and innovation. The full report can be downloaded from McKinsey.com. A recent McKinsey survey finds that chief investment officers are seeking more detail on how companies\u2019 ESG efforts link to their cash flow results. A significant majority of respondents say they are willing to pay a premium when companies can demonstrate that ESG programs relate to financial performance. But these investors indicate that clearer ESG standards\u2014and sharper methods for measuring ESG\u2019s long-term value\u2014would help them make more informed decisions. Partners Jay Gelb, Werner Rehm, and coauthors posit that the general lack of clarity could present an opportunity for companies to make the link between ESG and value more explicit. In 2020, Walmart committed to becoming a \u201cregenerative company.\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief sustainability officer, Kathleen McLaughlin, says this term encapsulates the company\u2019s ambitions to have net-positive impacts on people and the planet. Speaking with Tony Hansen, McKinsey\u2019s director of natural capital and nature, McLaughlin relates that Walmart\u2019s self-conception was shaped by the role it played in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the world\u2019s largest retailer found itself providing aid to stricken communities. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Brunswick Group partner Lucy Parker speaking about her new book, The Activist Leader: A New Mindset for Doing Business (HarperCollins, September 2023), coauthored by Jon Miller. Parker says leaders who can combine pragmatism with idealism can \u201cchange the game\u201d\u2014while future-proofing their organizations. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

This briefing note, based on McKinsey\u2019s latest published insights, was prepared by Seth Stevenson, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s New York office. Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #62, September 14, 2023 An expert in Europe\u2019s energy transition talks about the challenges and opportunities ahead. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. \u201cClimate action has always been plagued by a collective action problem,\u201d says Ann Mettler, vice president, Europe, at Breakthrough Energy. \u201cThose that moved ahead the fastest thought that if others don\u2019t pull along, that it is too much of a risk.\u201d But that\u2019s changing, Mettler tells the McKinsey Global Institute in a new episode of the Forward Thinking podcast with partner Michael Chui and cohost Janet Bush. Europe has been ahead of the curve when it comes to new technologies to combat climate change. The problem, she notes, is that Europe lacks an innovation ecosystem that can deploy technologies at scale. Technological speed, scale, and simplicity are crucial for Europe to maintain momentum in its energy transition. Brand owners continue to introduce new packaging formats and establish innovative ways to boost product recyclability and levels of recycled content. But high long-term demand for recycled content could lead to shortages of recycled packaging materials. Senior partners David Feber, Yasir Mirza, and coauthors offer three approaches that can boost supply, ensure access, and design for circularity. Companies may be hampered in pursuing a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy if their workforces aren\u2019t along for the ride. In new research that focuses on the perils of employee disengagement, McKinsey senior partner Aaron De Smet, partner Angelika Reich, and team look at the implications of worker attrition and disengagement on performance and productivity levels, as well as on costs for organizations as they emerge from the challenges of the pandemic and the Great Attrition. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #61, September 7, 2023 Net-zero flying, sustainable agriculture, growth-fueling technological advances, and urban real estate transformations: our weekly digest offers those topics and more in this best-of-summer SIG roundup. The aviation industry has committed to achieving net-zero flying by 2050. It will be a challenging process, but there are useful steps the sector can take now. McKinsey partners Axel Esqu\u00e9, Robin Riedel, Daniel Riefer, and coauthors examine how using a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) can help aviation players evaluate the costs and effects of various decarbonization actions. They write that a typical airline MACC might look at operational steps (such as creating incentives for pilots to fly and taxi more fuel efficiently), fleet issues (updating fleets too soon could mean missing out on the greener potential of next-generation aircraft), and fuel choices (the pathway to scaling advanced biofuels remains uncertain). Incorporating MACCs into business planning cycles now can help shorten the significant lead time associated with some decarbonization investments. Changes along the agricultural value chain\u2014including reductions in food waste, shifts in the global diet, and initiatives to conserve and reforest land\u2014can play an important role in meeting the world\u2019s decarbonization goals. But farms can also alter their own practices to reduce emissions. Partners Vasanth Ganesan, Joshua Katz, Peter Mannion, Pradeep Prabhala, and coauthors identify 28 measures that could help farms decarbonize, including electrifying on-farm machinery, converting from flood to drip or sprinkler irrigation, and using advanced feed additives. Technology\u2019s role in propelling sustainable, inclusive growth and solving complex global challenges is becoming even more crucial. Climate technologies\u2014including carbon capture, utilization, and storage, as well as carbon removals and circular technologies\u2014are just one area that is experiencing rapid innovation and investment. In McKinsey\u2019s Technology Trends Outlook 2023 report, senior partner Lareina Yee and colleagues analyze the most significant trends unfolding today\u2014and how companies can adopt and scale these technologies using a balanced and portfolio-oriented investment approach. Urban real estate continues to face substantial challenges arising from hybrid working, suburbanization, and the increase in online shopping. According to research by the McKinsey Global Institute, demand for office space in a median city could be 13 percent lower in 2030 compared with 2019. In a more heavily affected city, the decline could be as much as 38 percent. These challenges provide an opportunity to spur a historic transformation of urban spaces. Senior partners Andr\u00e9 Dua, Rob Palter, Aditya Sanghvi, Sven Smit, Olivia White, Jonathan Woetzel, and coauthors examine how cities and buildings can take a hybrid approach, including developing mixed-use neighborhoods and energy-efficient multifamily housing in suburban areas, as well as constructing more adaptable buildings. Here are other notable findings from SIG briefings this summer: And, finally, it\u2019s not too late to indulge in an annual reading rite: in McKinsey\u2019s 2023 summer reading guide, leaders around the world\u2014including CEOs, founders, and editors\u2014share the books they are reading, or planning to read, in genres including politics, history, innovation, business, workplace culture, and more. Also check out McKinsey\u2019s Author Talks, a series of interviews with authors of books on business and beyond.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #60, August 31, 2023 Economic growth can address both poverty and climate change, even when there are trade-offs involved. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. Accelerated global growth can further the two defining societal aspirations of our era: raising minimum living standards and limiting global warming. Our new research looks at how to accomplish both goals while minimizing the tensions between the two. Rapid increases in living standards could raise demand for energy- and emissions-intensive products and services. At the same time, not acting to curb temperature rise could harm economies, and the poorest populations are most heavily exposed to physical risks. New research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) quantifies what it would take to close the gaps in empowerment\u2014the level at which people can afford to meet essential needs\u2014and increase net-zero investment to 8 percent of global GDP annually over the next decade. As senior partners , Tracy Francis, Sven Smit, Jonathan Woetzel, and coauthors note, businesses and the market economy can generate half the combined resources through growth and innovation. The performance by G20 economies shows the central role that growth, technology, and finance can play in closing the empowerment gap and boosting net-zero investment. In a companion piece to the MGI report, senior partners Rajat Dhawan, Amit Khera, and team examine what it would take for G20 economies to progress toward these goals. The authors focus on the promise of new healthcare opportunities, clean technologies and manufacturing, and modern construction methods to make housing and mass transit greener and more resilient. The past two decades were kind to wealth accumulation but challenging for growth and equality. While the majority of executives today have lived most of their professional lives in this environment, the future could be quite different. The range of plausible medium-term scenarios today is unusually broad. McKinsey authors Michael Birshan, Jan Mischke, and Olivia White consider four plausible scenarios for how global economics might unfold in the next decade, ranging from a return to weak investment and a savings glut to productivity acceleration. They also suggest steps business leaders can consider to plan a sound strategy for whichever scenario prevails. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

This briefing note, based on McKinsey\u2019s latest published insights, was prepared by Barbara Tierney, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s New York office. Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #59, August 17, 2023 There are speed bumps in the European Union\u2019s orderly energy transition journey, making it imperative for member states to take transformative collaborative action. Our weekly digest of insights explores those topics and more. The European Union\u2019s exposure to Russian energy, among other economic headwinds, is challenging its ambitious and orderly pace of energy transition. A less orderly transition\u2014resulting from, among other factors, a lack of coordinated interventions among EU member states\u2014could raise the cost of energy for households and businesses in coming decades. This week, McKinsey analyzes how the European Union can increase the speed and scale of its transition. Elsewhere, a separate article examines how outperforming organizations manage to grow profitably while advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities. Europe\u2019s energy transition goals have encountered several challenges since 2021. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation have created energy security and affordability issues, especially among member states that are net importers of oil and gas. As a result, the European Union now needs to triple its pace of renewable-energy-source deployment to avoid a less orderly energy transition, which would be far more costly and damaging to the economy and the environment than one that balances affordability, reliability, resilience, and security. McKinsey senior partners Lorenzo Moavero Milanesi, Hamid Samandari, Humayun Tai, and coauthors recommend five action areas to help EU nations fulfill their net-zero agenda. Some leaders believe that achieving sustainable and inclusive growth often means forgoing revenue and profit. New McKinsey research has found that such trade-offs are not always a given. Companies that achieve better growth and profitability than their peers while improving sustainability and ESG also end up outgrowing their peers and exceeding them in shareholder returns. McKinsey senior partner Lucy P\u00e9rez and colleagues examine the key principles embodied by such outperformers who successfully deliver this growth trifecta. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: In the latest Author Talks, Siddarth Shrikanth talks about his new book, The Case for Nature: Pioneering Solutions for the Other Planetary Crisis (Duckworth Books Ltd., May 2023), in which he makes both an economic as well as a spiritual case for investing in nature. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities. By preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow, propelling wealth creation for working families, and supporting racial equity, McKinsey is helping to build an economy that works for everyone.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #58, August 10, 2023 Consumer attitudes toward electric vehicles are changing fast\u2014and the automotive retail industry must innovate to keep up. Our weekly digest of insights explores this topic and more. Electric vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity among car buyers, but these consumers are also becoming more discerning. They expect a far more personalized, flexible, innovative, and transparent purchasing experience, compared with traditional car buyers. This week, McKinsey analyzes the changing preferences of today\u2019s EV buyer\u2014and what it means for automotive retailers. Elsewhere, a separate article explores the development of methane-reducing feed supplements and other decarbonization technologies in agriculture. Changing consumer sentiment toward electrification is shaking up the automotive retail industry. As the general skepticism about EVs declines, an increasing number of people are considering buying battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, according to McKinsey\u2019s latest Future of Auto Retail consumer survey. Consumers\u2019 expectations for these vehicles are evolving, too, with a deeper focus on innovation and convenience. McKinsey partner Thomas Furcher and coauthors analyze the trends and current pain points in the EV-buying process. As the agriculture industry advances on its sustainability and decarbonization goals, new products to reduce methane emissions are seeing early adoption across some countries. One such product is Bovaer, a feed additive that has saved approximately 40,000 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent over the past eight months, according to Mark van Nieuwland, the company\u2019s vice president. McKinsey partner Joshua Katz speaks with van Nieuwland about the agriculture industry\u2019s methane emissions pledges\u2014and the new decarbonization opportunities on the horizon. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: In the latest Author Talks, Zeynep Ton, professor of the Practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management and president and cofounder of the Good Jobs Institute, discusses her new book The Case for Good Jobs: How Great Companies Bring Dignity, Pay, and Meaning to Everyone\u2019s Work (Harvard Business Review Press, June 2023). The author examines how targeted job strategies can improve performance, productivity, and profit. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities. By preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow, propelling wealth creation for working families, and supporting racial equity, McKinsey is helping to build an economy that works for everyone.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #57, August 3, 2023 Changes in how we live, work, and travel are going to fundamentally reshape certain industries over the next decade. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. The US job market continues to face disruption, with labor shortages and people exiting shrinking occupations. According to estimates from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), about 3.5 million jobs risk being displaced due to the net-zero transition. At the same time, increased federal investment into areas like renewable energy, for example, could create 4.2 million jobs in green industries, resulting in an overall net gain in employment. This week, McKinsey explores how the employment mix in the United States will change significantly by 2030. Elsewhere, a separate article looks at how sustainability considerations will shape the hotels of the future. Labor demand in the United States is undergoing a structural shift driven by the net-zero transition, the rise in automation, and hybrid work. In its latest report on the future of work in America, MGI explores how federal investment to address climate change and infrastructure issues could bolster jobs in industries such as construction and renewable energy, effectively offsetting employment losses in oil, gas, and automotive manufacturing. The report also estimates that, due to the aging workforce, there could be demand for 3.5 million more jobs for health aides, health technicians, and wellness workers by 2030. Kweilin Ellingrud, Olivia White, and coauthors analyze ongoing occupational shifts and workforce attrition\u2014and how employment demand will change over the long term. Hotels are on the brink of a transformation. A hotel room in the 2030s will likely have sensors to gauge your activity and appropriately customize the temperature for more efficient energy usage. The room might also be automated to aid furniture shifting and light control. Sustainability\u2014including the materials from which hotels are built and the way food is processed and served\u2014will be at the core of the traveler\u2019s experience. McKinsey senior partners Matteo Pacca, Caroline Tufft, and colleagues discuss the hotels of the future and their focus on delivering personalization, sustainability, and attractive employment opportunities. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: In McKinsey\u2019s 2023 summer reading guide, leaders around the world\u2014including CEOs, founders, and editors\u2014share the books they are reading, or planning to read, in genres including politics, history, innovation, business, workplace culture, and more. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities. The firm has formed a strategic collaboration with Cohere, the leading developer of enterprise AI platforms and state-of-the-art large language models, to help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations, redefine business processes, train and upskill workforces, and use this technology to tackle some of the toughest current challenges.

This briefing note, based on McKinsey\u2019s latest published insights, was prepared by Arshiya Khullar, an editor in McKinsey\u2019s Gurugram office. Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #56, July 27, 2023 Several technological advances on the horizon have potential to catalyze progress in business and society. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. Breakthroughs in bioengineering, mobility, and climate technologies could turbocharge business innovation and sustainable growth. Innovation in the cultivated-meat industry, for example, has helped to significantly lower its production costs. Estimates suggest that cultivated meat could provide 0.5 percent of the world\u2019s meat supply by 2030. This week, McKinsey looks at the top technology trends unfolding in 2023. Elsewhere, a separate article examines how shared-mobility solutions could overtake cars as a preferred (and more efficient) mode of transportation in the future. Technology\u2019s role in propelling sustainable, inclusive growth and solving complex global challenges is garnering heightened attention after a sobering 2022 for the industry. In bioengineering, advancements are being made in the production of cultivated meat and in biomaterials used for the chemicals and materials market. There is also increasing interest, innovation, and investment in climate technologies, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage as well as carbon removals and circular technologies. In McKinsey\u2019s Technology Trends Outlook 2023 report, senior partner Lareina Yee and colleagues analyze the most significant trends unfolding today\u2014and how companies can adopt and scale these technologies using a balanced and portfolio-oriented investment approach for long-term growth. The transportation sector will drastically transform in the coming decade, as consumers flock to shared, more sustainable and efficient modes of urban mobility. In McKinsey\u2019s latest Mobility Consumer Pulse Survey, partner Kersten Heineke and coauthors find that a quarter of the respondents living in urban areas are thinking of replacing their private vehicles with shared-mobility solutions such as autonomous shuttles, micromobility options including e-kickscooters and e-bicycles, and minimobility alternatives. Shared-mobility offerings represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity for industry players. Moreover, they can also help address urban-mobility challenges, including traffic congestion and air pollution. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: In a recent edition of Author Talks, Jamie Sears, founder and CEO of Not So Wimpy Teacher, discusses her new book, How to Love Teaching Again: Work Smarter, Beat Burnout, and Watch Your Students Thrive (Portfolio\/Penguin, April 2023), in which she talks about how educators can avoid burnout and better navigate the classroom as well as parent\u2013teacher relationships. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities. The firm has formed a strategic collaboration with Cohere, the leading developer of enterprise AI platforms and state-of-the-art large language models, to help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations, redefine business processes, train and upskill workforces, and use this technology to tackle some of the toughest current challenges.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #55, July 20, 2023 Cities, neighborhoods, and buildings are bracing for a transformation. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. Urban real estate continues to face substantial challenges arising from hybrid working, suburbanization, and the increase in online shopping. Vacancies in urban office and retail spaces have grown sharply since 2019, and home prices are increasing at a slower pace than in the suburbs. This week, McKinsey looks at how real estate executives can adapt, transform, and future-proof cities. Meanwhile, a separate article explores how technology leaders can guide the C-suite in turning the promise of generative AI into sustainable business value. Real estate demand, particularly in the urban core areas of global superstar cities such as New York, London, and Beijing, has been profoundly affected by the behavioral shifts caused by the pandemic. And the biggest sufferers are neighborhoods and cities with dense office space, expensive housing, and large employers in the knowledge economy. According to research by the McKinsey Global Institute, demand for office space in a median city could be 13 percent lower in 2030 compared with 2019. In a more heavily affected city, the decline could be as much as 38 percent. These challenges provide an opportunity to spur a historic transformation of urban spaces. Senior partners Andr\u00e9 Dua, Rob Palter, Aditya Sanghvi, Sven Smit, Olivia White, Jonathan Woetzel, and coauthors examine how cities and buildings can take a hybrid approach to thrive in these times, including developing mixed-use neighborhoods and energy-efficient multifamily housing in suburban areas, as well as constructing more adaptable buildings. Technology leaders play a critical role in capturing sustainable business value from generative AI. And the chief information officers and chief technology officers who have navigated previous technological waves know that getting past the pilot stage, reaching scale, and managing risk are key considerations involved in integrating new technologies into their businesses. Based on conversations with dozens of technology leaders and an analysis of generative-AI initiatives at more than 50 companies, senior partners Aamer Baig, Sven Blumberg, Alexander Sukharevsky, and colleagues recommend nine actions for sustainable value creation. These include establishing the company\u2019s posture regarding generative AI, developing a financial-AI capability to estimate the true costs and returns of such technology, and reimagining the technology function in its entirety. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: In a recent edition of Author Talks, Claire Hughes Johnson, corporate officer and adviser at Stripe, speaking about her new book, provides a tactical guide to management and company building and explains how a human-centric approach can be used to develop talent. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #54, July 13, 2023 Retailers need strategies to take on the \u201czero consumer\u201d and other industry challenges. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. A retailer\u2019s actions in the next two to three years could position it for success in the next 20. This week, McKinsey looks at how retail executives can set a course through an industry roiled by widespread change. Meanwhile, separate articles delve into how generative-AI (gen AI) technology could help streamline routine healthcare tasks, and the steps institutional investors are taking to face a new era of instability. Retail is a winner-take-most industry. The gap between winners and losers is widening, with the top 10 percent of publicly traded retailers now accounting for 70 percent of the industry\u2019s profits. Staying a winner is even harder, particularly when the rules of the retail game are shifting so much. Take \u201czero consumers,\u201d who shop across channels, show little loyalty, and expect sustainable products. Net zero is now a buying factor, as consumers vote with their wallets when it comes to sustainability and social responsibility. This confluence of challenges calls for a retail reset. Senior partners Becca Coggins, Franck Laizet, and coauthors recommend four areas where companies can focus, including evaluating business decisions using an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) lens. Generative-AI technology generates both excitement and apprehension, and nowhere is that more true than in healthcare, where patient data must be handled with extreme care. Gen AI, which can automate tedious and error-prone operational work, represents a potential breakthrough when it comes to clinical notes, diagnostic images, medical charts, and recordings. Many healthcare organizations can start using gen AI by applying the technology to these administrative and operational tasks, streamlining workflows and allowing providers to focus more resources on patient care. Senior partner Damien Bruce and his team look at these emerging use cases for private payers, hospitals, and physician groups. Institutional investors, accustomed to decades of economic stability that helped bring steady growth and strong returns, are facing a new era of uncertainty. To understand how they are responding, senior partners Sacha Ghai, Marcos Tarnowski, and colleagues interviewed senior executives at 40 of the world\u2019s leading pension and sovereign-wealth funds. The interviews revealed that investors are looking to integrate environmental and social considerations into their investing strategies, but that they are at different stages in that journey.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #53, July 6, 2023 More efficient ocean voyages could help the shipping industry reduce emissions. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. Shipping companies are eager to help reduce emissions. The industry is seeking lower-carbon fuels to power ships, but it also hopes to consume less energy by improving ships\u2019 efficiency. This week, McKinsey speaks with an executive from a start-up that uses data-driven insights to help shipping get greener. Meanwhile, a separate article looks at strategies to create more equitable outcomes for Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women in UK workplaces. The Copenhagen-based start-up ZeroNorth uses advanced analytics to help vessels cross oceans more efficiently. The company says it helped prevent more than 440,000 tons of CO 2 from being emitted by its customers\u2019 ships last year through techniques including optimizing routing in response to weather and monitoring the performance of components such as propellers and hulls. Partner Matt Stone spoke with Pelle Sommansson, chief operating officer of ZeroNorth, about bringing AI to the maritime world, listening to insights from captains and crews, and attempting to transform an industry that is sometimes resistant to change. In 2019, Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani workers in the United Kingdom earned about 15 percent less than White British workers. Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women, in particular, face disadvantages on key metrics of workplace equitability. In light of the strong business case for diversity on executive teams that previous McKinsey research has identified, senior partners Tania Holt, Tunde Olanrewaju, and coauthors suggest four ways for UK workplaces to make progress on equity for Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women: communicate the importance of this endeavor from the CEO down through the whole organization; collect insights through an intersectional lens; prioritize actions specifically targeted at meeting the unique needs of Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women; and rigorously track and course correct efforts while celebrating success. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features senior partners Eric Lamarre, Kate Smaje, and Rodney Zemmel speaking about their new book, Rewired: The McKinsey Guide to Outcompeting in the Age of Digital and AI (Wiley, June 2023), which debuted in the third spot on the Wall Street Journal\u2019s list of bestselling business books. The authors share details from the playbook they use to help companies undertake digital transformations.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #52, June 29, 2023 Farms can embrace new agricultural methods to decarbonize. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. Agricultural land is responsible for 70 percent of the world\u2019s freshwater withdrawals, and food systems are the world\u2019s primary driver of biodiversity loss. Any path to a greener future will need to involve changes in how we farm. This week, a McKinsey report examines efforts to create more sustainable agriculture. Meanwhile, a separate article looks at the potential to convert petroleum refineries into renewable-fuel production centers. Changes up and down the agricultural value chain\u2014including reductions in food waste, shifts in the global diet, and initiatives to conserve and reforest land\u2014could play an important role in meeting the world\u2019s decarbonization goals. But farms can also alter their own practices to reduce emissions. Partners Vasanth Ganesan, Joshua Katz, Pradeep Prabhala, Peter Mannion, and coauthors identify 28 measures that could help farms decarbonize, including electrifying on-farm machinery, converting from flood to drip or sprinkler irrigation, and using advanced feed additives. Refitting existing petroleum refineries can be faster and cheaper than building new facilities for renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from scratch. But not all refineries are good candidates for this switch. Partners Khush Nariman, Brian Roth, and coauthor offer a checklist for conversion decisions. Among important considerations: Is the refinery close to sources of RD and SAF feedstocks such as soybean oil and beef tallow? Will it benefit from regional policy incentives? And can the local marketplace for renewable fuels support the conversion? Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Joanne Lipman, former editor in chief of the USA Today network, speaking about her new book, Next! The Power of Reinvention in Life and Work (Mariner Books, Spring 2023). The author explains her four-step process for self-reinvention: search for information and experiences, struggle to change, stop your old life, and find your new solution. McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #51, June 22, 2023 The aviation sector will need to determine which green initiatives provide the greatest returns. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. The aviation industry has committed to achieving net-zero flying by 2050. It will be a challenging process, but there are useful steps the sector can take now. This week, McKinsey analysis examines a method that can help aviation players assess which decarbonization actions should be prioritized. Meanwhile, a separate article investigates whether mining of metals that are critical to the energy transition can keep up with projected demand, given regulatory constraints. And a piece looks at environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies tailored to fit railway companies. Aviation stakeholders can evaluate the costs and effects of various decarbonization actions by using a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC). A typical airline MACC might look at operational steps (such as creating incentives for pilots to fly and taxi more fuel efficiently), fleet issues (updating fleets too soon could mean missing out on the greener potential of next-generation aircraft), and fuel choices (the pathway to scaling advanced biofuels remains uncertain). Partners Axel Esqu\u00e9, Robin Riedel, Daniel Riefer, and coauthors suggest that aviation companies should incorporate MACCs into business planning cycles now to account for the significant lead time associated with some decarbonization investments. The energy transition will necessitate increased mining of metals such as copper, lithium, nickel, and cobalt. But regulatory hurdles (including mine permitting, which can routinely take up to ten years in some jurisdictions) often slow production. Senior partner Harry Robinson and coauthors recommend that companies, communities, and governments collaborate to make regulations consistent, streamline permitting processes, and create transparency around decisions. Railway companies can benefit from developing holistic ESG strategies. When elements of ESG are intertwined with a railway\u2019s business, opportunities emerge for new partnerships, new products, and additional revenue streams. Senior partner Nicola Sandri and coauthors offer a four-step plan for developing a comprehensive ESG strategy: diagnose strengths and weaknesses, define commitments, embed the strategy in the business, and report results externally. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features strategist John Horn speaking about his new book, Inside the Competitor\u2019s Mindset (MIT Press, April 2023). The author explains the value of using cognitive empathy to help us look through our competitors\u2019 eyes. What might seem irrational to us might make perfect sense for a competitor.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #50, June 15, 2023 McKinsey is assessing its own efforts to foster sustainable, inclusive growth. Our weekly digest of insights explores that topic and more. This week, McKinsey shares its annual environmental, social, and governance (ESG) report. It examines our most recent efforts to create sustainable, inclusive growth through our actions and our work with clients. Among other findings, the report assesses McKinsey\u2019s progress toward reaching its goal of becoming the world\u2019s largest private-sector catalyst for decarbonization. Elsewhere, a separate article examines tactics that could help the solar industry deliver capacity-adding projects more efficiently. And another piece looks at one company\u2019s plan to encourage more companies to accept US government benefits through digital payments. McKinsey clients have contributed 80 percent of the world\u2019s reported reduction in CO 2 emissions. McKinsey itself has donated, since 2020, about $620 million in cash and in-kind support toward social-responsibility initiatives. To learn more about our firm\u2019s ESG-related actions and commitments, read comments from global managing partner Bob Sternfels, and download the entire document, visit McKinsey\u2019s 2022 ESG report. America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act offers funding for solar-energy projects, but various bottlenecks are hampering the quest to deliver on those projects. Among them: labor shortages in engineering and construction, limited access to land and permits, inflation, and supply chain constraints. Senior partner Humayun Tai and coauthors suggest that renewables players could rethink their delivery strategies by putting more focus on forming partnerships, revisiting the risk allocations in their contracts, developing their workforces, and adopting digital solutions. Ofek Lavian, cofounder and CEO of the payments start-up Forage, wants to help more businesses accept online payments via government-issued electronic benefit transfer cards (what was once broadly referred to as \u201cfood stamps\u201d). Food assistance recipients in the United States often face hurdles that make it harder for them to shop online for groceries. In a conversation with McKinsey\u2019s Matt Cooke, Lavian recounts how he was inspired to fix this problem when the COVID-19 pandemic transformed online grocery shopping from a luxury into, for many Americans, a necessity. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features David Moinina Sengeh, chief innovation officer for the government of Sierra Leone, speaking about his new book, Radical Inclusion: Seven Simple Steps to Help You Create a More Just Workplace, Home, and World (Flatiron Books, May 2023). The author details specific actions that can help us remove barriers to inclusion\u2014including, to start, being sure that we precisely define \u201cexclusion.\u201d McKinsey strives to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #49, June 8, 2023 Short-haul air travel might be poised to take off. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. In 2019, air travel was the mode of choice for only about 8 percent of trips covering a distance of roughly 95 to 500 miles in the United States, and only about 4 percent of such trips in the European Union. That might change as short-haul flying becomes more convenient, affordable, and sustainable. This week, McKinsey analysis examines the rise of regional air mobility (RAM). Elsewhere, an interview with the CEO of the Global Infrastructure Hub looks at strategies for ramping up the construction of sustainable infrastructure. Travelers often decide that shorter trips will be cheaper, easier, and quicker by car than by air. But technological innovations in the design of small aircraft, thicker congestion on roadways, the increasing salience of sustainability, and the rise of user-friendly apps that turn mobility into a service could combine to make short-haul flying more attractive. Partners Axel Esqu\u00e9, Robin Riedel, and coauthors say several developments could help enable the RAM transition, including continued advances in decarbonized aircraft propulsion technology and improved infrastructure at regional airports. The Global Infrastructure Hub is a nonprofit organization formed by the G-20. Its CEO, Marie Lam-Frendo, recently spoke with McKinsey about the quest to build more sustainable infrastructure around the world. Lam-Frendo says that public\u2013private partnerships will be crucial in the effort to derisk infrastructure investment. She adds that infratech\u2014which involves embedding technology into infrastructure\u2014could cut expenses and create more efficient outcomes. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Dr. Sheena Iyengar, a Columbia Business School professor, speaking about her new book, Think Bigger: How to Innovate (Columbia Business School Publishing, April 2023). The author offers a step-by-step methodology for inventing new solutions to existing problems.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #48, June 1, 2023 Seven specific traits might determine a company\u2019s ability to create financial value while also achieving positive social impact. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues have gained salience with consumers, investors, and regulators, companies have become motivated to examine their own efforts in these realms. This week, a McKinsey survey assesses how organizations are thinking about their ESG initiatives. Survey results suggest that companies that exhibit seven specific traits are more likely to create value while reinforcing values. Meanwhile, a second article examines approaches that could improve retention, promotion, and satisfaction rates for women working in the public sector. The newest McKinsey Global Survey asks some 1,100 respondents across the world about their organizations\u2019 ESG outlooks. More than nine in ten say that ESG issues are on their companies\u2019 agendas. One-third say their organizations\u2019 ESG-related actions have improved employee retention. Senior partners Lucy P\u00e9rez, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Sneessens, and coauthors suggest that the survey\u2019s results point to seven organizational characteristics that can help ESG initiatives succeed. Among them: being accountable to external stakeholders, linking compensation to ESG metrics, and empowering a specific C-suite executive to define and oversee ESG efforts. Although women are better represented in the public sector than in the private sector, women remain underrepresented at the top of the public sector\u2019s talent pipeline. Senior partner Nora Gardner and coauthors offer three suggestions for leaders who are hoping to do more to foster women\u2019s career development: train managers to effectively run diverse, inclusive, hybrid teams; expand the scope of sponsorship programs that connect women with organizational advocates; and fine-tune performance evaluations to better recognize women\u2019s positive achievements.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #47, May 25, 2023 Nuclear power could play a critical role in decarbonization. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Energy production currently accounts for about 30 percent of global emissions, and electricity demand could triple by 2050. It\u2019s clear that meeting the world\u2019s climate goals will require decarbonizing the power sector. This week, a McKinsey commentary suggests that nuclear energy could be a significant part of the solution. Elsewhere, an article examines the new infrastructure requirements that will be created by the transition to battery- and hydrogen-powered aviation. Nuclear energy can provide reliable, 24\/7 power while using less land than wind or solar arrays. It is already the largest single source of zero-carbon power in the United States. Senior partners Daniel Pacthod, Humayun Tai, and coauthors suggest that nuclear power could play a growing role in meeting the world\u2019s net-zero targets, but only if the industry first overcomes obstacles such as public skepticism, nonstandardized plant designs, and an aging expert workforce. Aggressively reallocating capital to the sector, streamlining licensing processes, and training a new generation of workers could help the nuclear industry meet the challenges ahead of it. Aircraft powered by batteries or hydrogen could comprise 21 to 38 percent of the world\u2019s commercial and cargo fleet by 2050. Stakeholders should begin to prepare for the infrastructure changes that will be needed to accommodate these new technologies, according to a report from the Target True Zero initiative of the World Economic Forum (for which McKinsey provided knowledge support). Large airports, in particular, will need to increase and alter their energy capabilities. McKinsey partner Robin Riedel and coauthors say that an intercontinental air hub might need to allocate approximately $3.9 billion toward infrastructure updates by 2050, while a major regional airport might need to invest about $1.3 billion. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features senior partners Eric Lamarre, Kate Smaje, and Rodney Zemmel speaking about their new book, Rewired: The McKinsey Guide to Outcompeting in the Age of Digital and AI (Wiley, June 2023).

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #46, May 18, 2023 What will it take for one of the world\u2019s largest nations to become a farming powerhouse? Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Agriculture technology, or agtech, could add $95 billion to the Indian economy annually by 2030. This week, a McKinsey report examines which digital resources and other technologies could help rural Indian farmers embrace modern farming. McKinsey research focusing on Europe, meanwhile, explores how leaders could think about allocating precious land for renewable-energy projects. And the question of how to scale clean hydrogen is the subject of a column from a leader on McKinsey\u2019s global hydrogen team. Agriculture remains a central part of the Indian economy, accounting for more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s GDP. But hundreds of billions of dollars in growth could be left on the (farm to) table\u2014unless the Indian agriculture industry embraces agriculture technology, or agtech, as McKinsey senior partner Avinash Goyal and coauthors uncover in their latest report. The space is gaining traction: Indian agtech start-ups raised about $1.6 billion in funding from investors in the past four years, mostly focused on platforms and products that play across the value chain, create digital solutions, or offer \u201cagribiotech,\u201d which uses biotechnology to create sustainable new products. European leaders have set lofty goals to expand their renewable-energy sources (RES) by 2030. But one rigid problem stands in their way: land. Finding land to use for RES projects is difficult. Leaders should weigh the benefits of using the land for RES projects versus agriculture\u2014if they don\u2019t opt for land conservation altogether. Combining geographic information, satellite data, and AI, McKinsey partner Raffael Winter and his coauthors identify which areas are best suited for RES projects when weighing the costs. Demand for hydrogen production is expected to grow four- to sixfold by 2050 and could cut global emissions by up to 20 percent annually in that time. Despite its promise, not all hydrogen is produced equally, as McKinsey partner Markus Wilthaner explains in his take on how to scale clean hydrogen. To realize hydrogen\u2019s decarbonization potential, production costs need to drop, infrastructure needs to evolve, and investors and executives need to close the $460 billion investment gap. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features retired United Airlines chairman and CEO Oscar Munoz and his new book, Turnaround Time: Uniting an Airline and Its Employees in the Friendly Skies (Harper Business, May 2, 2023), cowritten by Brian DeSplinter. In it, Munoz explains why listening to employees before diving into a company\u2019s turnaround strategy is what distinguishes a successful transformation.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #45, May 11, 2023 What is the world\u2019s leading electric-vehicle adopter doing to meet rising demand? Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Norway has more than 22,000 public electric-vehicle (EV) chargers, serving more than half a million electric vehicles. This week, a McKinsey report analyzes the Scandinavian nation\u2019s approach to scaling EV charging infrastructure, offering lessons to other markets that build on the Norwegian experience. Elsewhere, McKinsey research sheds light on how organizations can reduce Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that appear across the value chain. And an interview with an industrial-agriculture executive highlights the role of biotech in raising livestock. Norway provides a useful case study on how to scale EV charging infrastructure, as McKinsey partners Kjartan Kalstad, Swarna Ramanathan, and coauthors uncover in their latest report. To illustrate how quickly demand has grown in the country, whose pioneering approach to energy infrastructure has also become front-page news, consider this: it took four years to sell the first 10,000 EVs in Norway, but it only took four weeks to sell that many in 2022. To meet demand, a variety of actors have entered the competitive market to provide charging stations\u2014although a clear leader hasn\u2019t emerged, offering an opportunity to operators. Reducing Scope 3 emissions (which arise throughout an organization\u2019s value chain) is a must-solve issue as regulatory and investor pressures mount. Reducing those emissions begins by addressing six key dimensions\u2014including supplier and customer selection and green-portfolio strategies\u2014which simultaneously allow companies to capture value, according to McKinsey senior partners Jukka Maksimainen, Michel Van Hoey, and coauthors. In the chemicals industry, for example, sourcing from or partnering with providers of low-carbon raw materials could increase the share of recycled or biobased feedstock, which helps to reduce emissions both up and down the value chain. Despite the rise in alternative proteins, animal-based food sources will continue to play an important role in the global food supply, according to Tina Sejersg\u00e5rd Fan\u00f8, executive vice president for agriculture and industrial biosolutions at biotech company Novozymes. For that reason, the focus should be on making animal production as sustainable as possible, Sejersg\u00e5rd Fan\u00f8 explains to McKinsey senior partner Harry Bowcott and colleague. They discuss emerging innovations in the sector, such as a product that reduces the use of antibiotics in poultry farms, as well as examples of industry collaborations that could help to get us one step closer to a net-zero global economy. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: Today, 31 percent of nurses say they may leave their current jobs in direct patient care in the next year, reflecting the persistent challenges affecting the nursing labor market, according to our latest survey of frontline nurses in the United States. McKinsey senior partner Gretchen Berlin and coauthors examine what healthcare organizations can do to help attract and retain nurses. Firms that adopt a \u201cone-firm\u201d operating model\u2014where the \u201cwe\u201d takes precedence over the \u201cI\u201d\u2014are more than twice as likely to be in the top quartile of high-performing organizations. How does a one-firm business function in practice? McKinsey senior partner Scott Keller and coauthors outline the mechanics. What is an effective meeting? Chances are, you could describe what isn\u2019t an effective meeting. Consider this latest McKinsey Explainer the ultimate framework in deciding \u201cCould this be an email instead?\u201d A recent edition of Author Talks features University of Oxford professor Paulo Savaget and his new book, The Four Workarounds: Strategies from the World\u2019s Scrappiest Organizations for Tackling Complex Problems (Flatiron Books, March 2023). In it, the author shares how unconventional approaches to problem solving can bring the best results.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #44, May 4, 2023 What is the current status of organizational thinking about inclusion? Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. More than 70 percent of companies express transformative ambitions around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). But less than half say they have the infrastructure in place to realize those ambitions. This week, a McKinsey report analyzes the shifting landscape faced by organizations\u2014including the challenge of translating DEI aspirations into results. Elsewhere, McKinsey research delves into consumer attitudes about the sustainability of product packaging. And a piece investigates whether AI can help insurers mitigate climate-related property risks. The State of Organizations 2023 report\u2014compiled by senior partners Dana Maor, Michael Park, Patrick Simon, and coauthor\u2014identifies the ten most significant shifts confronting organizations today. Among them: the push to make meaningful progress on DEI. More than 20 percent of survey respondents who were asked about DEI said they can\u2019t confirm that there is a sense of community and inclusion in their organizations. (Other topics covered in the report include the growing capabilities of AI, the changing expectations regarding talent attraction and retention, and the rise of the hybrid workplace.) The newest McKinsey survey on packaging finds that about half of American consumers say they\u2019re willing to pay more for products that are sustainably packaged. But, on average, respondents rank hygiene, ease of use, and durability as more important packaging characteristics. Senior partner David Feber and coauthors note that 40 percent of respondents living in urban neighborhoods cite the environmental impact of products as an extremely or very important factor in their buying decisions\u2014compared with only 21 percent of respondents living in rural areas. Executives from the analytics platform ZestyAI speak with partners Doug McElhaney, Christie McNeill, and Uma Sandilya about the potential for AI to help property and casualty insurers account for climate-related risks. AI-aided property assessments might also help inform property owners about strategies for reducing those risks. Insurers hoping to incorporate AI into their operations must sometimes contend with outdated tech infrastructure and regulatory limitations. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features poet Maggie Smith\u2014best known for the viral poem \u201cGood Bones\u201d\u2014speaking about her new book, You Could Make This Place Beautiful (Atria\/One Signal Publishers, April 2023). Smith\u2019s memoir offers hard-earned perspectives on loss, forgiveness, and perseverance. McKinsey is striving to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #43, April 27, 2023 Ships will need to run on greener fuels\u2014but which ones? Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. The world is seeking ways to decarbonize on land and at sea. In the maritime world, most ships are currently powered by fossil fuels, but greener fuel possibilities abound. This week, McKinsey analysis examines shipping companies\u2019 plans and expectations as the industry prepares to adopt lower-carbon fuels. A separate article looks at the quest to decarbonize aluminum production. And a survey about retail banking assesses American consumers\u2019 interest in climate-linked financial products. To discover how shipping industry leaders are thinking about the adoption of lower-carbon fuels (such as ammonia and hydrogen), the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation, the Global Maritime Forum, and the M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping recently conducted a survey\u2014with analysis by McKinsey\u2014of shipping companies that own and operate fleets comprising roughly 20 percent of the world\u2019s total capacity. About one-third of respondents say they don\u2019t know which types of fuel they expect their vessels to run on in future decades. Partner Matt Stone and coauthor suggest that there is opportunity for first movers to shape future fuel scenarios. Aluminum can be infinitely recycled, with no loss of quality. But because much of the electricity needed for the world\u2019s aluminum smelting comes from coal-fired power plants, the industry accounts for roughly 2 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Partners Jeffrey Lorch, Alex Ulanov, and coauthors outline potential actions for stakeholders\u2014including the finance sector (which could back investments in greener production processes), policy makers (who could offer grants to offset the costs of the transition), and aluminum customers (who could pledge to pay a 5 or 10 percent premium for green aluminum). A McKinsey survey reveals that nearly 40 percent of American consumers report interest in enrolling in a climate-linked financial product (such as a climate-screened index fund). That interest extends across regions and income levels. Senior partners Marie-Claude Nadeau, Dan Stephens, and coauthors say that climate-linked financial products don\u2019t need to be \u201cconcessionary\u201d offerings since, in many cases, consumers express a willingness to pay more for them. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research on sustainable, inclusive growth: A recent edition of Author Talks features venture capitalists Freada Kapor Klein and Mitchell Kapor speaking about their new book, Closing the Equity Gap: Creating Wealth and Fostering Justice in Startup Investing (HarperCollins Publishers, March 2023). The authors invest in tech start-ups that help close gaps of access, opportunity, or outcome for disadvantaged communities, and they maintain that this approach has resulted in top-quartile financial returns. McKinsey is striving to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #42, April 20, 2023 Decarbonization could transform the steel industry. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. The steel industry is in a volatile moment, with a fragile outlook for the next decade. Decarbonization will play a major role in shaping steel\u2019s future. This week, a McKinsey article looks at how industry players can navigate the current crossroads\u2014with an eye toward greening the sector. Meanwhile, a separate article examines lessons learned from efforts to decarbonize the chemical industry in Germany. And a piece investigates the potential for recirculating the tech devices that large companies provide en masse to their employees. An uncertain long-term demand forecast is complicating decision making for steel industry stakeholders. Partners Oleksandr Kravchenko, Benedikt Zeumer, and coauthors offer an analysis of potential scenarios, including an examination of decarbonization\u2019s possible impact. While overall steel demand growth is expected to slow or stagnate, global demand for low-carbon steel is expected to grow tenfold over the next decade. Producing green steel will require significantly more power, which means regions with lower energy costs could attract investment\u2014shifting the industry\u2019s geographical footprint. The chemical industry is large, energy-intensive, and responsible for roughly 2 percent of the world\u2019s total emissions. Senior partners Ulrich Weihe, Thomas Weskamp, and coauthors present takeaways from the industry\u2019s decarbonization initiatives in Germany. They identify four high-priority levers for reducing emissions: using a greener mix of fuels for steam generation, recapturing wasted heat, procuring renewably produced electricity, and maximizing energy efficiency. Large corporations lease an immense number of tech devices such as smartphones, laptops, and computer monitors. The Berlin-based start-up circulee acquires preowned devices from large organizations, tests them, and recirculates them to smaller enterprises in need of tech hardware\u2014offering a solution that\u2019s both green and cost-effective. Thomas Gros, the CEO and cofounder of circulee, spoke with associate partner Tomas Laboutka about the challenge of convincing customers that preowned devices don\u2019t incur additional risk or inconvenience. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: Nine McKinsey colleagues spoke at this year\u2019s South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. A recap of their presentations touches on, among other topics, the business case for alternative proteins, the potential for Formula 1 auto racing to reshape the broader mobility sector, and the power of empathy to counteract employee burnout. McKinsey is striving to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #41, April 13, 2023 Hubs for carbon capture, utilization, and storage could let companies collaborate to achieve their net-zero goals. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) systems could help many hard-to-abate sectors achieve net-zero targets. Creating CCUS hubs\u2014with capabilities shared across multiple companies or industries\u2014might ease uptake of the technology. This week, McKinsey research examines ways to accelerate the development of CCUS hubs. Meanwhile, a separate article looks at the potential for reusable (not to be confused with recyclable) packaging. CCUS hubs that serve multiple companies or sectors could lower costs, reduce risks, and attract government funding. There are currently about 15 CCUS hubs around the world in various stages of development. McKinsey analysis suggests that approximately 700 CCUS hubs could eventually be established. Partner Luciano Di Fiori and coauthors say that the business case for these hubs will depend, in part, on the availability of renewable energy to power carbon removal and the willingness of parties from different industries to cooperate on hub formation. Reusable packaging (picture the returnable glass milk bottles of yore) has seen renewed interest lately, given its potential for minimizing waste. But reusability faces scaling challenges relating to infrastructure, safety, and cost. Senior partner Oskar Lingqvist and coauthors outline key questions to answer, including: How many times must a package be reused before gains are realized? How far will the average reusable package travel between uses? And will consumers be willing to adapt their behavior to reusability? Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Don Norman, a former Apple executive and founding director of the University of California Design Lab, speaking about his new book, Design for a Better World: Meaningful, Sustainable, Humanity Centered (The MIT Press, March 2023). Norman draws a distinction between human-centered design (which aims to help people understand and use products) and humanity-centered design (which aims to reduce those products\u2019 harmful effects on the environment). McKinsey is striving to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities. By preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow, propelling wealth creation for working families, and supporting racial equity, McKinsey is helping build an economy that works for everyone.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #40, April 6, 2023 Automotive suppliers will need to adapt as electric vehicles become more prevalent. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. As the electric-vehicle (EV) market grows, automotive suppliers will need to accommodate changing demand. By 2030, sales of EV parts such as electric powertrain components are projected to comprise a much larger portion of suppliers\u2019 revenue pools. This week, a pair of McKinsey articles looks at the opportunities and challenges that automotive suppliers are likely to encounter as vehicle electrification accelerates. Meanwhile, an interview examines the potential for wireless charging of EVs. Between 2020 and 2022, EV sales grew by more than 90 percent in both the United States and Europe and by more than 300 percent in China. This surge has had dramatic effects up and down the automotive value chain. Components for electric powertrains, in particular, are now in high demand. Partners Brian Loh, Lukas Michor, Patrick Schaufuss, and coauthors offer guidance for suppliers of these components. Among their suggestions: cooperate with manufacturers to identify emerging needs; investigate M&A opportunities, which can come to the fore when marketplaces are in transition; and maintain focus on supply chain resilience as the industry landscape shifts. Although demand for parts such as batteries and electric motors will grow as EVs proliferate on the world\u2019s roads, senior partner Andreas Venus and coauthors note that many standard parts\u2014such as axle systems and suspensions\u2014will remain core components even as vehicles increasingly become electrified. These core components will generate a shrinking portion of total market revenues (declining from 69 percent in 2022 to 55 percent by 2030) but will still represent a significant source of value for suppliers. Suppliers will benefit from remaining focused on these core components even as they monitor the evolution in demand. Wireless charging of EVs could be just as efficient as wired charging\u2014without the inconvenience of a cord. Partners Florian N\u00e4gele and Shivika Sahdev interview four executives from companies hoping to provide wireless EV-charging solutions. Though widespread adoption is likely years away, wireless charging\u2014which can be functionally similar to using an induction cooktop\u2014has much potential: for instance, it might enable autonomous EVs to charge themselves. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: Hotels are facing acute labor shortages. Partner Ryan Mann and coauthors offer three techniques to improve hotel staffing models: use more granular metrics to better predict the ebbs and flows of staffing needs, redesign roles to combine multiple responsibilities, and assign staff to cover a network of locations instead of just one hotel. Customer experience is becoming a primary differentiator for telecom companies. Senior partners Nicolas Maechler, Rohit Sood, and coauthors counsel telcos to redesign customer service in ways that make it more proactive\u2014for instance, presenting customers with support options before they realize their Wi-Fi has gotten spotty. Satellites using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can see through clouds and darkness to gather images. Partner Dale Swartz and coauthor spoke with Payam Banazadeh, founder and CEO of Capella Space, a company that has provided SAR capabilities for defense and intelligence purposes. Banazadeh says SAR has commercial applications, such as allowing companies to monitor their global infrastructure. Partner John Means spoke with David Arena, head of global real estate at JPMorgan Chase. The company\u2019s new headquarters building in Midtown Manhattan features state-of-the-art office amenities. Among them: a pleasant smell. \u201cWe\u2019ve done lots of due diligence on aromatherapy,\u201d says Arena. A recent edition of Author Talks features Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, speaking about his new book, The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism (Penguin Random House, February 2023). Wolf expresses his view that the marriage of democracy with the market economy is failing and that we must reverse this failure or risk succumbing to antidemocratic forces.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #39, March 30, 2023 Insufficient access to healthcare, high-speed internet, and financial services can harm Black communities. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. White Americans have 80 percent more wealth than Black Americans. Lack of inclusivity in the financial-services sector is among the culprits. This week, a guest on The McKinsey Podcast discusses ways to close the wealth gap\u2014and also narrow racial inequities relating to healthcare and technology. Meanwhile, a separate article outlines opportunities for property and casualty (P&C) insurers hoping to aid the net-zero transition. And a compendium of McKinsey pieces on the global food crisis examines, in part, how global food systems have been disrupted by climate change. A recent McKinsey report on Black economic mobility identified eight potential areas of investment to help support Black-owned businesses and Black communities. Senior partner Shelley Stewart III, coauthor of the report, discussed its findings in an appearance on The McKinsey Podcast. Stewart says better access to financial services and broadband internet could expand opportunities for Black Americans. But he adds that any effort to remedy racial disparities should not ignore access to healthcare, as good health is a crucial starting point for meaningful participation in the economy. The net-zero transition could present growth opportunities for P&C insurers. Senior partner Sylvain Johansson and coauthors say insurers can attempt to capture value by providing decarbonization advisory services, developing products that transfer net-zero-related risks, and launching new business models. One example of a potential new model: using customer data to connect building owners with solar-energy companies while insuring the installation and operation of solar equipment. A briefing examines the harmful disruption of the global food system. Climate change is threatening the world\u2019s breadbaskets. Inefficient production processes squander a significant portion of harvested food before it reaches grocers\u2019 shelves. Lack of access to nourishing food can exacerbate inequity: more than three billion people around the world can\u2019t afford a healthy diet. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: This Women\u2019s History Month, McKinsey leaders spoke about their roles as women in the workplace\u2014and beyond.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #38, March 23, 2023 Innovative new designs could accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Global power consumption could triple by 2050 as vehicles, building operations, and industrial processes all become electrified. It\u2019s not clear, however, that renewables such as wind and solar will be able to keep pace with demand. This week, McKinsey research examines whether nuclear power\u2014a zero-carbon energy source that currently generates roughly 10 percent of the world\u2019s electricity\u2014can scale up to fill the gap. A separate article outlines opportunities created by the passage of America\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which will provide more than $1 trillion in public investment. Elsewhere, a piece considers the tangential business impacts that could result from electrification of America\u2019s commercial vehicle fleets. Nuclear power plant projects have frequently been hampered by construction delays and cost overruns. A new generation of smaller, less complex reactors has been designed with the goal of cutting costs and accelerating build times. Partner Bill Lacivita and coauthors suggest several approaches that could help quickly scale up construction of plants, thereby aiding efforts to reach decarbonization targets. Among them: establish streamlined international licensing processes, standardize designs for plant systems and components, and consider building multiple reactors at a single location. Clean-energy funding provided by the BIL could be available to a wide range of stakeholders involved with projects up and down the value chain\u2014from electric-grid improvements to carbon capture initiatives to the development of clean hydrogen. Roughly 40 percent of funding has been launched, but new funding cycles are expected to begin in early 2023. Partner Adam Barth and coauthors say that organizations that can tell a compelling story focused on economic development, environmental justice, and equity are more likely to seize funding opportunities. The transition to battery-electric-vehicle commercial fleets will create myriad new business possibilities, such as charge point servicing and battery recycling. Partner Malte Hans and coauthors foresee resulting value pools being captured primarily by vertically integrated players, such as OEMs and utility companies. Strategic partnerships might improve the odds of success for others. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at Columbia University and University College London, speaking about his new book, I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique (Harvard Business Review Press, February 2023). The author expresses his view that, in the AI age, the right questions might be more valuable than the right answers. McKinsey is striving to create inclusive growth through collaborations with clients and local communities.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #37, March 16, 2023 Climate technologies must be scaled faster to meet net-zero goals. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. To meet current net-zero targets, climate technologies will need to be scaled faster. But challenges remain\u2014particularly amid an uncertain economic moment. This week, a McKinsey article outlines promising areas of action for builders of green businesses. A separate piece looks at growth in climate-related investing and highlights key factors for investors to consider. Elsewhere, McKinsey research examines opportunities for recyclers of electric-vehicle (EV) batteries. Climate tech must accelerate rapidly to meet net-zero commitments. Even mature technologies such as wind and solar will need to scale six to 14 times faster (exhibit). Bold decisions are necessary to stave off the direst climate change outcomes. Senior partners Rob Bland, Laura Corb, Tomas Naucl\u00e9r, and coauthors suggest three moves to make now: develop supply chains by seeking partnerships across sectors (upstream, downstream, and horizontally); close the skills gap (by, for instance, launching new training facilities or partnering with universities on talent-building initiatives); and explore new financing avenues (such as blended finance models, which mix private, public, and philanthropic funding). Climate-related investments grew significantly in 2022\u2014up 6.6 percent from the year before\u2014despite secular headwinds. Growth in energy transition financing has been bolstered by both policy support and general alignment in capital markets. Senior partners Fredrik Dahlqvist, Anders Rasmussen, and coauthors outline several factors essential to the success of climate-related investments. Among them: demonstrated effectiveness of technologies, a clear path to cost competitiveness for products, and the ability of leadership teams to attract necessary talent. More EVs on roads means more EV batteries\u2014and a greater need to recycle those batteries. More than 100 million EV batteries are expected to be retired in the next decade. These batteries can be refurbished and given second lives in other applications, but the battery recycling market remains far from maturity. Senior partner Martin Linder and coauthors say that to be successful, battery recyclers should secure sufficient access to end-of-life batteries, build partnerships up and down the recycling value chain, and keep tabs on the latest trends in battery design. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features former IBM chair and CEO Ginni Rometty speaking about her new book, Good Power: Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work, and World (Harvard Business Review Press, March 2023). The author describes her journey from childhood poverty to the C-suite and explains her conviction that asking for help is a sign of strength.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #36, March 9, 2023 Decarbonizing cement and concrete production could lead to business opportunities. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Global demand for cement and concrete nearly tripled over the past 20 years and is expected to remain consistent in upcoming decades. But producing these materials is a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. This week, McKinsey research looks at strategies for creating sustainable\u2014and profitable\u2014cement value chains. Elsewhere: an examination of the shifting landscape for real estate investors suggests that they should embrace sustainability initiatives as opportunities for value creation. And a piece about design thinking offers tips on how best to design with sustainability in mind. Circular technologies could help cement players generate profits while reducing emissions. Examples of circular approaches include deriving energy from recovered heat, capturing and storing carbon, and repurposing waste materials (for example, turning demolished structures into gravel for roads). Senior partners Jukka Maksimainen, Daniel Pacthod, Humayun Tai, Michel Van Hoey, and coauthors say that the use of circular technologies could help eliminate or mitigate roughly two billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Climate change is already shaping real estate valuations. Real estate investors would be wise to consider physical risks (such as floods) and transition risks (such as changes in regulatory requirements) that could stem from climate-related disruptions. Amid a broader examination of the real estate landscape, senior partners Daniele Chiarella and Aditya Sanghvi and coauthors offer guidance for real estate players looking to navigate climate change. Among their suggestions: carefully evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities attached to any prospective property, consider decarbonizing existing properties to enhance their value, and explore potential new businesses (such as offering emissions reduction services to other property owners). Careful product design can aid decarbonization efforts. A McKinsey Explainer about design thinking outlines strategies for generating sustainable products. Smart design approaches can reduce emissions from both a product\u2019s manufacturing process and its end use. \u201cSkinny design\u201d can create products that require less material and packaging. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features leadership coach Sally Helgesen speaking about her new book, Rising Together: How We Can Bridge Divides and Create a More Inclusive Workplace (Hachette Book Group, February 2023). The author describes her simple test for identifying inclusive workplaces: do most employees speak about the organization as \u201cwe\u201d or as \u201cthey\u201d?

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #35, March 2, 2023 A resilience agenda could help leaders weather short-term disruptions while maintaining focus on sustainable, inclusive growth. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Organizations are seeking ways to build resilience in a world where they\u2019re confronted with continuous, overlapping disruptions. Maintaining long-term perspective is crucial even amid short-term crises. In conjunction with the World Economic Forum, McKinsey presents a \u201cresilience agenda\u201d to help guide leaders who are attempting to foster sustainable, inclusive growth during a challenging moment. Elsewhere: an article offers guidelines for oil and gas companies looking to invest in the sustainable-power value chain. And McKinsey analysis reveals the value of employing neighborhood-level data in crafting American racial-equity initiatives. Leaders should avoid being overwhelmed by immediate issues, even as disruptions mount. Choices about how to create a resilient world can translate into trillion-dollar swings in GDP growth\u2014and incalculable differences in the quality of human life. McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels and World Economic Forum president B\u00f8rge Brende present a resilience agenda that offers a framework for building resilience across dimensions such as climate, healthcare, technology, and geopolitics. A holistic approach, a long-term mindset, and openness to public\u2013private collaborations are all vital enablers of resilience. Energy markets are changing rapidly, and the traditional business models of oil and gas players are under pressure. Senior partner Humayun Tai and coauthors say that oil and gas companies are strongly positioned\u2014given their global scale, significant resources, and unique capabilities\u2014to play key roles in the energy transition. Among the most promising areas for investment by these companies: offshore project development, hydrogen production and transportation, and electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. Nationally aggregated data about racial inequity can sometimes miss crucial details that are specific to American cities or neighborhoods. McKinsey research has revealed important microlevel differences relating to issues such as education and food security. McKinsey Global Institute director Kweilin Ellingrud and North America social responsibility leader Ramesh Srinivasan suggest that a greater understanding of equity gaps between neighborhoods could help stakeholders prioritize in a more targeted manner. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features University of Southern California adjunct professors of entrepreneurship Garrett Brown and Colin Coggins speaking about their new book, The Unsold Mindset: Redefining What It Means to Sell (HarperCollins Publishers, February 2023). The authors express their views that manipulation and smarm are ineffective sales techniques and that authenticity and emotional intelligence can help salespeople close deals.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #34, February 23, 2023 Corporate monetary pledges aimed at fighting racial injustice have become more difficult to track. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. In recent years, many large companies have made monetary pledges to fight racial injustice. This week, the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility analyzes those pledges. New research reveals, among other insights, that these commitments have become more broadly targeted and more difficult to track. Elsewhere, an article looks at how supply chain snarls can impede renewable-energy projects. Companies\u2019 monetary commitments in support of racial equity have become less specifically targeted since 2021. Companies increasingly direct monetary pledges toward broad initiatives that don\u2019t always disclose how funds are spent. McKinsey partner Duwain Pinder and coauthors offer suggestions for companies looking to make future pledges. Among them: be transparent and specific about the timelines and targets of pledges, and don\u2019t forget\u2014while making those external pledges\u2014to also make internal commitments to employees. Supply chain tangles have created difficulties for developers of renewable energy. Labor shortages and the geographic concentration of vital raw materials are among the most pressing obstacles to the construction of new (and in-demand) wind and solar capacity. Senior partner Alberto Bettoli and coauthors say vertical integration could be one solution: renewables companies that can acquire or partner with materials suppliers might be better able to keep projects on track. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor Robert Waldinger speaking about his new book, The Good Life: Lessons From the World\u2019s Longest Scientific Study of Happiness (Simon & Schuster, January 2023). Waldinger, who oversees the Harvard Study of Adult Development, says the 85-year-old longitudinal study reveals that the strongest source of happiness is good relationships, a successful career does not always result in contentment, and no one is happy all the time.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #33, February 16, 2023 Banks need better methods for handling data on sustainability. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. The banking industry faces increasing pressure to disclose data relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Achieving greater transparency will require banks to adapt their IT infrastructure. This week, a McKinsey piece lays out an ESG-data road map for banking\u2019s IT leaders. Separately, an interview with the chief sustainability officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore looks at approaches to financing the net-zero transition. And McKinsey research reveals that meat consumption trends in China could have environmental implications. To keep pace with regulatory changes and consumer needs, banks need to integrate ESG-related data into their IT systems and processes. McKinsey partner Henning Soller and coauthors offer banking\u2019s IT leaders best practices on the topic. Among them: give investors real-time visibility into the ESG-related aspects of their portfolios, ensure that ESG data handling is sensitive to both shifting market demands and location-specific regulatory requirements, and encourage cross-functional collaboration to avoid data silos. Severe weather events resulting from climate change pose a grave threat to Southeast Asia. Gillian Tan, chief sustainability officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, spoke with McKinsey partner Bharath Sattanathan about the potential to use a blend of public and private finance to help combat climate change. Tan wonders whether financial institutions could be offered inducements\u2014such as different treatment of loans for green initiatives\u2014to take more action in the fight against carbon emissions. Results of a McKinsey survey of Chinese consumers identify trends in meat consumption, including attitudes toward sustainability. Senior partners Sheng Hong and Roberto Uchoa de Paula and coauthors note that awareness of food sustainability issues is rising in China but has not yet resulted in increased enthusiasm for alternative meat. Almost 80 percent of survey respondents report that they dislike the taste of alternative meat products. About 20 percent dislike the price. Here are other recent notable findings from McKinsey research: A recent edition of Author Talks features University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School professor Tess Wilkinson-Ryan speaking about her new book, Fool Proof: How Fear of Playing the Sucker Shapes Our Selves and the Social Order\u2014and What We Can Do about It (HarperCollins Publishers, February 2023). Wilkinson-Ryan maintains that decision making suffers when people are scared to look foolish but improves when people make themselves cognizant of that fear.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #32, February 9, 2023 Consumers say they care about sustainability\u2014but what do their wallets say? Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. In surveys, American consumers often signal that sustainability matters to them. But are they in fact more likely to buy a product if it\u2019s sustainably produced? This week, McKinsey research investigates whether products that make claims related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sell better than products that don\u2019t. Meanwhile, a separate article looks at ways to close the Black tech talent gap. And a piece examines decarbonization efforts in the cement and concrete industry. Consumer products that made ESG-related claims on their packaging grew faster over a five-year period than products that made no claims, according to a study jointly conducted by McKinsey and NielsenIQ. Among other findings from the study (which analyzed sales data covering 600,000 individual product SKUs representing $400 billion in annual retail revenues): ESG-related claims boosted sales across varied product categories and brand sizes, and less-common claims tended to be associated with larger sales effects. Senior partner Steve Noble and coauthors say that consumer-packaged-goods companies could benefit from ramping up development of environmentally sustainable and ethically produced products. Black people constitute 12 percent of the US workforce but only 8 percent of tech employees and 3 percent of C-suite tech executives. As a result, Black households could lose out on more than a cumulative $350 billion in tech job wages by 2030. Senior partner Mark McMillan and coauthors suggest several actions that could help close the Black tech talent gap. Among them: develop stronger partnerships between corporations and historically Black colleges and universities and upskill Black tech employees to ease advancement into leadership ranks. Cement production is a crucial target for decarbonization as it generates 7 percent of global CO 2 emissions. Senior partner Jukka Maksimainen and coauthors identify three emissions-reduction levers that could aid the effort: replace clinker (a lumpy substance\u2014often used as a binder in cement products\u2014that accounts for 90 percent of cement production emissions) with alternative materials such as fly ash or metal slag; use electric kilns to cut energy-related emissions; and store and reuse remaining CO 2 . Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features father\u2013daughter duo Alex Jadad and Tamen Jadad-Garcia speaking about their new book, Healthy No Matter What: How Humans Are Hardwired to Adapt (Penguin Random House, January 2023). The authors elucidate, among other themes, their concept of \u201cenoughness\u201d: health strategies can err both by doing too much (overtesting, overdiagnosing) and too little (failing to control risk factors such as high blood pressure or high blood sugar).

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #31, February 2, 2023 Executives are navigating a serpentine path to net zero. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Getting to net zero will involve trade-offs between long-term goals and short-term realities. It could be a serpentine path, full of setbacks and adjustments. This week, a McKinsey podcast looks at possible next moves for executives trying to balance decarbonization efforts against pragmatic concerns. Meanwhile, a separate article examines the economics of electrifying America\u2019s commercial-vehicle fleets. Many executives might be wondering how to advance toward a decarbonized future while enduring near-term economic shocks. In an episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Anna Moore and senior partner Humayun Tai discuss this duality and its ramifications. One way to make pragmatic strides toward decarbonization is to search for win\u2013win scenarios in which decarbonization initiatives lead to market share gains. Operators of American commercial-vehicle fleets have been hesitant to embrace electrification\u2014in part because they have memories of an earlier transition (to engines powered by compressed natural gas) that failed to successfully materialize. But Moritz Rittstieg, Saleem Zafar, and coauthors say shifting economics are making this an appealing moment to make the switch to electric fleets. Facts to consider: electricity is now three to five times cheaper than diesel fuel, and battery electric vehicles might outperform internal-combustion-engine vehicles in terms of total cost of ownership as soon as 2025. Investments related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns have attracted increasing levels of interest\u2014and scrutiny\u2014in recent years, and companies have endeavored to solidify their ESG-related policies. Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features senior partners Venkat Atluri and Mikl\u00f3s Dietz speaking about their new book, The Ecosystem Economy: How to Lead in the New Age of Sectors without Borders (John Wiley & Sons, October 2022). The authors maintain that cross-sectoral ecosystems\u2014bundling a variety of offerings from different industries\u2014are poised to create increasing levels of value while making life easier for consumers.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #30, January 26, 2023 Inadequate broadband access for Black households could factor into lower Black representation rates in the American tech workforce. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. In the United States, Black households lag behind White households in digital skills, ownership of desktop and laptop computers, and access to high-speed internet. It\u2019s a gap that can be interpreted as both a cause and an effect of inadequate Black representation in the American tech workforce. This week, McKinsey analysis looks at ways to narrow that digital divide. Meanwhile, a separate piece assesses the shortfall of women working at European tech companies\u2014and offers suggestions to redress the imbalance. Only 69 percent of Black Americans have desktop or laptop computers, compared with 80 percent of White Americans (exhibit). Disparities like this can skew hiring for tech jobs\u2014which often pay better than other occupations\u2014thereby exacerbating income and wealth gaps. Kunal Modi, Todd Wintner, and coauthors posit five steps that could be taken to help promote digital equity and inclusion. Among them: conduct comprehensive surveys of underserved locations to ensure that Black communities receive their fair share of tech-enabling government funding, and partner with local stakeholders to ensure that eligible households then take advantage of these subsidies. Women occupy only 22 percent of all tech roles across European companies. The percentage of European women in STEM drops off precipitously during the transition from secondary school to university and again during the transition into the workforce. Senior partner Sven Blumberg and coauthors suggest four interventions that could improve women\u2019s representation in European tech. One potential approach is to retrain and redeploy women to place them in tech fields where hiring is growing fastest. Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Ha-Joon Chang, professor of economics at SOAS University of London, speaking about his new book, Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World (PublicAffairs, January 2023). Chang explains why he uses stories about food to elucidate economic arguments, while also expressing his belief that countries can benefit from strong, government-led industrial policies.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #29, January 19, 2023 As Davos 2023 continues, sustainable and inclusive growth lies at the center of many discussions. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. The World Economic Forum (WEF) gathered leaders from around the world this week. As a strategic partner to the WEF, McKinsey is engaging with Davos 2023 participants\u2014including decision makers from government, business, and civil society\u2014to identify opportunities for creating sustainable, inclusive growth across the globe. Our WEF overview page is the place to find McKinsey\u2019s latest Davos-related insights and interviews. Elsewhere: McKinsey analysis points to six areas of action for business leaders and policy makers who hope to enable an orderly transition to renewable energy. And a look at the future of batteries examines strategies for making the industry more sustainable and resilient as battery demand rises. Sustainability and inclusivity are central discussion topics at Davos 2023. Senior partner and chief marketing officer Tracy Francis and senior partner Daniel Pacthod explain why the WEF matters more than ever as leaders around the world reimagine globalization for a new, uncertain era. In partnership with the WEF\u2019s Centre for the New Economy and Society, senior partners Kweilin Ellingrud and Lareina Yee and coauthors examine best practices for improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and suggest ways to make DEI efforts more quantifiable and scalable.

Senior partners Hamid Samandari and Humayun Tai and coauthors outline six steps for reducing emissions while maintaining a resilient energy supply. Among them: securing and developing land for renewable energy. To meet some climate goals, a high proportion of the land suitable for generating solar or onshore wind power will need to be used efficiently. As global demand for lithium-ion batteries grows, the industry will face new opportunities and challenges. In collaboration with the Global Battery Alliance, senior partners Mikael Hanicke and Martin Linder and coauthors suggest ways to scale up effectively and responsibly. Three important components for healthy growth: diversified supply chains, decarbonized operations, and a circular value chain, in which materials are reused, repaired, or recycled. Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Myra Strober, founding director of Stanford\u2019s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, speaking about her new book, Money and Love: An Intelligent Roadmap for Life\u2019s Biggest Decisions (HarperCollins Publishers, January 2023), written with Abby Davisson. Strober explains her \u201c5Cs\u201d framework for making decisions about money and love: clarify, communicate, consider a broad range of choices, check in with family and friends, and anticipate likely consequences.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #28, January 12, 2023 Davos 2023 begins next week, with global sustainability and inclusivity expected to be major focal points. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) kicks off next week in Davos, Switzerland. As a strategic partner to the WEF, McKinsey will engage with Davos 2023 participants\u2014including decision makers from government, business, and civil society\u2014to identify opportunities for creating sustainable, inclusive growth across the globe. Our WEF overview page will be the place to find McKinsey\u2019s Davos-related insights and interviews. In the meantime: a McKinsey article offers four strategies for fashion brands looking to become more inclusive by connecting with Black consumers (whose spending on apparel and footwear is expected to reach $70 billion by 2030, with much new business up for grabs in the interim). And a piece examines the rise of virtual healthcare, while suggesting ways to include populations that are getting left behind in the rush to telemedicine. Davos 2023 will run from January 16\u201320. Sustainability and inclusivity are poised to be central discussion topics. Chief marketing officer and senior partner Tracy Francis and senior partner Daniel Pacthod have hosted a sneak preview video covering what to expect. And next week, Pacthod will join senior partner Kate Smaje to host an on-site event\u2014that welcomes virtual attendees\u2014providing firsthand accounts of what they\u2019re seeing and hearing on the ground in Switzerland. To prepare for the WEF, check in on what young global leaders view as top Davos agenda items. (If you\u2019re in need of a primer, read McKinsey\u2019s explainer: \u201cWhat is Davos?\u201d) When shopping for apparel, Black consumers are 11 percentage points more likely than non-Black consumers to prefer e-commerce options. Senior partners Tiffany Burns and Shelley Stewart III and coauthors analyze data on Black consumers\u2019 buying habits while suggesting four effective strategies for reaching these shoppers: amplify products made by Black creators (and inspired by the needs of Black consumers); employ diverse marketing campaigns (that include user-generated content from Black consumers); make products affordable (and offer flexible payment models); and build digital and physical shopping realms in which Black consumers feel welcome. Telemedicine represented 1 percent of patient visits prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It now represents 14\u201317 percent of visits. But there are emerging gaps in access to virtual healthcare: for instance, though rural areas are often physically farther from in-person health services, they still trail urban areas when it comes to virtual-healthcare adoption. Alex Harris and coauthors suggest that telemedicine\u2019s potential could be bolstered by improving uptake rates for lower-income patients, older patients, and patients with less access to technology. Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features marketing professor Peter Fader and retail scientist Michael Ross speaking about their new book, The Customer-Base Audit: The First Step on the Journey to Customer Centricity (Warton School Press, November 2022). Fader and Ross maintain that long-term business growth begins with a deep understanding of how customers think and behave\u2014and with an acknowledgment that some customers provide far more value than others.

Sustainable and inclusive growth: Briefing note #27, January 5, 2023 A majority of luxury-vehicle owners are ready for the shift to electric vehicles. Our weekly digest of McKinsey insights explores that topic and more. Luxury-vehicle owners around the world are open to buying electric vehicles (EVs). They also profess very little brand loyalty. This week, McKinsey research examines the global luxury-vehicle sector and the opportunities that could emerge as it transitions to an EV-heavy future. A separate article looks at the entrance of Asian EV brands into the European market\u2014and what European incumbents might learn from it. Meanwhile, a look at the potential benefits of using drone-powered package delivery services finds that drone deliveries could eventually be cheaper and greener than other last-mile delivery options. A global McKinsey survey of owners of luxury vehicles (retailing for $200,000 or more) finds that 62 percent of respondents who own luxury vehicles with internal-combustion engines are open to switching to EVs or plug-in hybrids. And 95 percent of luxury-vehicle owners say they\u2019d consider switching brands for their next vehicle purchase. Senior partner Jan-Christoph K\u00f6string and coauthors suggest that many luxury-EV customers could soon be up for grabs and that manufacturers might boost brand loyalty by fostering exclusive owners\u2019 communities replete with special events and services. Asian EV makers are gaining a foothold in the European market. Their strategies have varied widely, ranging from direct-to-consumer approaches to partnerships with local importers. Among the customer frustrations these new players are attempting to address with better solutions: puzzlement at opaque vehicle pricing and disappointment over long delivery wait times. Niels Dau and coauthors suggest that incumbent European brands might seize this unsettled moment amid the ongoing EV transition to make overdue changes\u2014or risk getting left behind by disruptive Asian competitors. Thousands of commercial drone deliveries already occur every day around the world. Drones could potentially offer lower carbon emissions than other last-mile delivery options such as cars and vans (even electric ones). But, say Robin Riedel and coauthors, labor costs could be a limiting factor: for drones to succeed, regulations and technology will need to permit a single operator to control many drones simultaneously. Here are other recent notable findings from our research: A recent edition of Author Talks features Jacob Harold, cofounder of Candid, speaking about his new book, The Toolbox: Strategies for Crafting Social Impact (John Wiley & Sons, December 2022). Among the powerful tools Harold recommends for enacting social change and building a better world: game theory, mathematical modeling, design thinking, and storytelling.

EAFs and electrolyzers, used for hydrogen production, will demand considerable electrical energy. As a result, clear, clean electricity goals are needed on the federal and state levels. Furthermore, renewable energy generation must be facilitated to meet the needs of decarbonizing industries. On the federal level, the White House set a target of reaching 100% carbon pollution\u2013free electricity by 2035, focusing on generation, transmission, storage, and the use of CCUS on existing power plants. The IRA\u2019s clean energy credits, such as 45V, 48C, 45Y, and 48E, aim to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy generation and storage capacity. The IRA also allows developers to stack certain credits to drive down costs further. For instance, if the renewable electricity generator and hydrogen facilities are separate entities, a hydrogen project procuring exclusively renewable electricity could claim investment and production tax credits for clean hydrogen and clean electricity (subject to the soon-to-be-released time-matching criteria of 45V). In the Great Lakes, Minnesota set a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, and Illinois and Wisconsin by 2050. Michigan uses different language, setting a goal to reach economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, all states in the Great Lakes except Indiana, which has renewable portfolio goals, have enacted renewable portfolio standards. Yet there is still a lack of renewable energy generation (hydro, wind, and solar) penetration in the region, with only Wisconsin (26%), Illinois (11%), and Indiana (10%) at or above 10%, mainly due to onshore wind production. There is a need for bold renewable energy and power sector decarbonization policies across the Great Lakes, considering the region\u2019s importance for EAFs and hydrogen development. One of the main barriers is the time it takes projects to connect to the grid. PJM and MISO, the two main electricity operators in the Great Lakes, have 3,042 and 1,734 active projects in interconnection queues, respectively. Most of these projects are solar and wind generation or battery-based storage. PJM has publicly stated that it currently has a two-year backup for its grid connection queue and had to pause review of new requests until at least 2025. Policymakers in the region need to monitor the interconnection queue issue and find ways to streamline the process and unlock clean energy capacity already in the permitting process. Given the regional nature of transmission organizations like PJM and MISO this challenge is not one that states can resolve individually Advocating for forward looking transmission planning within states and across state lines will be essential to support the development and interconnection of new renewable generation capacity. All states in the Great Lakes have a statewide interconnection policy, providing a process customers can follow and avoid arbitrary delays. However, only Illinois and Minnesota have adopted procedures that align with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission model rules. Steel producers also have the option to avoid grid connection delays by constructing behind-the-meter renewable power systems. Cleveland-Cliffs and US Steel have made successful and highly profitable businesses by vertically integrating their value chains from coal and iron mining through steel production and finishing. Incorporating upstream processes is nothing new for these companies, which also already operate power generation facilities at several of their BF-BOF locations. Finding methods to incentivize steel producers to pursue behind-the-meter projects could provide a way to expedite low-emissions steel production and contribute to faster regional decarbonization. Clean Hydrogen As explored, clean hydrogen and near-zero-emissions steel go hand in hand. To catalyze a thriving lower-emissions steel industry, clean hydrogen production must be prioritized. The federal government published the US National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap and Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen to provide insights on how and when hydrogen could reach full-scale commercial adoption. For hydrogen, the IRA provides the 45V production tax credit, which could offer up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen based on the emissions intensity of the hydrogen production pathway. All hydrogen production pathways, including fossil fuel\u2013based hydrogen production, are eligible for the credit, with the credit value received depending on achieving the same emissions intensity thresholds.[xii] This new tax credit will make US-produced hydrogen some of the most cost competitive in the world and in doing so make hydrogen-based steel production in the United States uniquely profitable. Hydrogen development is also being supported federally via the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program facilitated by OCED. The program includes $8 billion in total funding to establish multiple hydrogen production hubs leveraging diverse production methods and off-take sectors. Multiple hydrogen hubs in the Great Lakes region have received a notice of encouragement on their concept papers and have now submitted full applications for funding; details about each are included in Figure 17. Figure 17: Developing Great Lakes Hydrogen Hubs At present, the United States lacks comprehensive federal regulation governing hydrogen. There are significant gaps in US hydrogen\u2019s regulatory structure. The federal government has yet to decide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over interstate hydrogen pipeline, storage, import, and export facilities. Also, it needs to establish common standards for blending hydrogen in interstate natural gas pipeline systems, considering that states such as Minnesota already allow gas utilities to submit innovation plans including hydrogen-based fuels as alternatives. Local regulations also apply for production, transportation, and use of hydrogen. In Minnesota, Executive Order 22-22 ordered agencies to evaluate the state\u2019s regulatory preparedness for hydrogen, and the Illinois Senate passed SB 3613 to create the Hydrogen Economy Act and the Hydrogen Economy Task Force to identify barriers to the widespread development of hydrogen. States need to proactively follow Minnesota\u2019s and Illinois\u2019 lead to understand their specific hydrogen regulatory landscape and be ready to assess and fill gaps when federal agencies announce updates in regulations and authority oversight. This is crucial to minimize any unexpected delays or unnecessary costs and challenges to project development. Pennsylvania passed HB 1059, which provides a tax credit of $0.81 per kilogram of hydrogen to companies that buy hydrogen made in Pennsylvania and $0.47 to companies that buy natural gas in order to make hydrogen. These incentives have no environmental safeguard nor standard that applicants must meet to receive funding, incentivizing the production of fossil-based blue hydrogen and the purchase of natural gas. With federal subsidies financially supporting the hydrogen and CCS pathways, states in the Great Lakes can look to take a stronger role in supporting the required infrastructure and coordination of these projects. Finally, Michigan is the only state in the region with a hydrogen roadmap, created by the University of Michigan with support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which identifies steelmaking as a potential candidate to use hydrogen. The roadmap provides a high-level overview of the main steel facilities assets in the states that could adopt hydrogen and estimates GHG emissions reductions as well as implementation costs. Other Great Lakes states should leverage existing EDO and university efforts to craft similar technology road maps. Carbon Capture and Storage The DOE\u2019s carbon management report provides a common fact base of the path to commercial liftoff for carbon capture technologies. There are multiple reports stating that the Great Lakes region is uniquely positioned to become a global hub for carbon capture technologies, especially for primary steel production facilities in the region because production sits near viable CO 2 storage sites. Michigan and Pennsylvania have ordered reports to assess the opportunities, risks, and policy recommendations to advance the development of carbon capture technologies. Companies will require a Class VI permit from the EPA if they intend to pursue subsurface sequestration for their CCS projects, but the process is notoriously long. Thus, several states are seeking primacy over Class VI wells to have their own regulatory agencies take on permit applications. Currently, only North Dakota and Wyoming have state primacy over Class VI and Ohio is the only state in the region seeking it. The IIJA provides $50 million in grant funding to award underground injection control grants and to support states\u2019 efforts to develop programs leading to primacy. Separately, the law includes $25 million in funding for the EPA to permit Class VI storage projects in those states that do not yet have Class VI primacy or choose not to pursue it. In addition to Class VI primacy, states need to complementarily establish pore space ownership, permitting processes, and long-term stewardship programs for carbon capture projects deployment. States must establish the foundations to regulate carbon capture technologies by following the example of Indiana. Michigan is starting to lay the groundwork for future projects by including CO 2 as a pipeline carrier and allowing CO 2 pipelines to be viable for permitting and construction from the Michigan Public Service Commission. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has also taken ownership of reviewing two pipelines currently in development and setting precedent for environmental review processes moving forward. Even though these efforts are in the right direction, much more work is needed. Indiana is taking the lead in the Great Lakes under HB 1209, making the state an early adopter in CCS regulation in the region. The state built up a regulatory structure to address pore space ownership, liability, permitting, monitoring, and mineral rights primacy. On top of funding from the IIJA, the IRA increased the 45Q tax credit from $50 to $85 per ton of CO 2 captured and stored and provides a direct pay option for developers. Cost estimates for CCS implementation at steel facilities range from $40 to $100 per ton of CO 2 , with transmission and storage potentially adding an additional $24 per ton. In this cost range, with further declines expected, 45Q has the potential to eliminate a large percentage, if not all of the investment required for CCS implementation at steel facilities. Workforce It is essential to ensure that the region\u2019s primary steelmaking and coal mining workforce can transition to fossil fuel\u2013free steelmaking. The jobs associated with hydrogen, renewables, and carbon capture technologies will require training programs and facilitated transitioning processes. Recent federal legislation includes specific funding focused on retraining workers as well as tangential policies that can be used to support the labor transition. The IIJA contains at least $800 million specifically dedicated to workforce development. The IRA has numerous workforce development opportunities, particularly in high-demand sectors such as clean energy and construction. In the Great Lakes, Illinois has the most comprehensive and robust clean energy workforce development framework, through the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (2021), including programs that prioritize iron and steelworkers. Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have several generalized workforce development programs, including for former fossil fuel communities, but without steel-specific retraining programs. On an individual project basis, steps must be taken by developers to ensure that quality jobs and community benefits are prioritized. Legally binding project labor agreements can help enforce local hire requirements and other financial and health\/safety protections for employees. Training programs at local universities, community colleges, and other publicly funded educational institutions can help the Great Lakes states position themselves ahead of the curve when it comes to producing a workforce uniquely poised to support a low-emissions steel economy. Land Land-based policies to support economic growth can take the form of enterprise or renaissance zones for economic, workforce, and community development, where businesses receive incentives to locate operations in these specific zones. On the federal level, the Lawrence Livermore National Lab administers the High Performance Computing for Energy Innovation (HPC4EI) Program, which funds domestic manufacturers innovating in the energy space while encouraging them to collaborate with nonprofits and universities in opportunity zones. In 2021, one of the project recipients was steel producer ArcelorMittal, which received the award for research on creating energy-efficient steelmaking. Furthermore, the Biden administration\u2019s Buy American program incentivizes domestic manufacturing, which encourages the placement of manufacturing sites on land in the United States. All states in the Great Lakes region have an enterprise zone program that could benefit steelmakers. Although there are examples of steel distributors or producers of steel products taking advantage of these zones, there are no specific incentives or standards tied to steel that could encourage facilities, especially mini mills, to be in one of the zones. The redevelopment of abandoned, underutilized, or closed steel mills also represents an opportunity to help boost a regional solar industry by installing solar panels in these brownfield sites. The federal government offers a range of grant and loan programs designed to support brownfields redevelopment and reuse. For over two decades, the EPA has managed a range of federal brownfields grants, and most of these received historic increased funding from the IIJA. The IRA has three new grants programs that can supplement \u201cbrightfield\u201d development. The DOE\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program offers $5 billion for low-cost loans to retool, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure, and the EPA\u2019s Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants program gives $3 billion to invest in community-led projects in disadvantaged communities. All states in the Great Lakes have funding opportunities for brownfield remediation, including for former coal mines, mostly dedicated to on-site renewable energy projects. The installation of a 133,000-square-foot solar array on a former Pittsburgh steel mill, developed by Pennsylvania\u2019s Regional Industrial Development Corporation, is a good example of how to leverage existing unused infrastructure to support economic growth and provide benefits to local communities.","filter_flag":1}

My thanks to Cuba for hosting this gathering of the G-77+China on an important topic at a crucial time. A time when the triple planetary crisis \u2013 fuelled by unsustainable consumption and production \u2013 is a dead weight slowing sustainable development. Many developing nations are reeling under climate change. Struggling with nature and biodiversity loss \u2013 including desertification. Choking with pollution and waste. These challenges drive other crises. Human health. Cost of living. Poverty. Hunger. Conflict. And there is, of course, massive injustice inherent in the triple crisis, particularly climate change. So, it is understandable that trust is low. But every nation of the world must now work, together, towards a low-carbon, nature-positive, pollution-free future. It is time for unity, not division. There is too much at stake, for all of humanity. That is not to say that every country should follow the same path. Rich industrialized nations have a responsibility to slash emissions and pollution \u2013 with G20 economies responsible for around 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Give nature a chance to recover. Support the adaptation needs of developing nations and address loss and damage. Developing nations have a responsibility, primarily to themselves and their citizens, to take an entirely different path to prosperity. To reap the benefits of development that prioritizes a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. As President Ruto of Kenya told the Africa Climate Summit, the developing world needs \u201can audacious leapfrogging\u201d. Science, technology and innovation, or STI, gives developing nations the chance to not just leapfrog, but to bound energetically into a future of prosperity, resilience and equity. STI has proven its worth many times in the environmental sphere. In dealing with persistent organic pollutants. In solar tech and electric vehicles. In pivoting the cooling industry to protect the ozone layer and climate. Excellencies, Let me here make two important points on STI. First, let\u2019s remember that nature is the original technology. Nature stores carbon. Filters water. Protects against extreme weather. And much more. Nature-based solutions can\u2019t do everything, but they can do a lot: for example, deliver about one-third of the climate mitigation needed annually to stay on track for the goals of the Paris Agreement, all while creating new jobs and economic opportunities. So, before we turn to new technology, we should look first to what nature can do. Second, STI should not be used to seek quick fixes or fanciful magic bullets. Technologies such as Solar Radiation Modification, for example, are fraught with risk. They are not a replacement for cutting emissions. STI should be used only to help us work smarter and harder to reshape societies and economies. Let me just give a few examples of where STI will be crucial. Implementing the upcoming deal to end plastic pollution will require chemists, manufacturers and process engineers to design out plastics from products and create new environmentally friendly products. Make products suitable for reuse, refill, repair, recycling and disposal. Deploy green and sustainable chemistry to get rid of harmful chemicals and find safe alternatives \u2013 because 3,200 substances associated with plastics have one or more hazardous properties of concern. Innovation is key. As the Convention on Biological Diversity has said, synthetic biology can bring new solutions to issues such as biodiversity loss, climate change, hunger and vector-borne diseases. Sharing these benefits, for example those derived from digital sequencing information under the Global Biodiversity Framework, will be crucial for fairness and equity. Developing countries must be able to benefit from these resources, not just corporations in the global north. So, we need to share technologies while ensuring safety and considering whole of society approaches. As the electric vehicle and renewable energy transition intensifies, we will see significant increases in demand for critical minerals like copper, cobalt and nickel. For example, from 2017 to 2022, the energy sector drove a tripling in demand for lithium. These scarce resources will need to be marshalled: through efficiency in use and recycling materials into new products. Deploying STI in this space would reduce the pressure that mining places on the environment. And reduce the pressure on people and communities who work in mines under conditions incompatible with human dignity and sustainable development. Friends, Let me now look, in broad strokes, at three areas in which STI can help developing nations leapfrog, and how UNEP \u2013 as one of only two UN organizations headquartered in the Global South \u2013 can help. One, inclusive digitalization and data access. If we use digital tools well, we find more solutions and we get them out in a way that is relevant. This is why UNEP has elevated the role of digital transformation. Part of UNEP\u2019s vision is to democratize access to data so that it can be used to make a difference. Through data frameworks that are fit-for-purpose and inform action. Through the World Environment Situation Room, which aims to get real solutions to real people. Through sharing data to bring real-world impact \u2013 by, for example, providing UN Country Teams with environmental information to improve on-ground delivery in the developing world. Two, predicting, and preparing for, the future. Forewarned is forearmed, as the saying goes. STI can both forewarn and forearm the world. UNEP\u2019s ongoing strategic foresight exercise has identified several hundred signs of new developments, across all facets of society, that could affect planetary health. These range from physical changes to emerging technologies. UNEP plans to have an initial mapping of these signs and a global foresight report next year. Together with the rest of the UN system, UNEP works to implement the Early Warnings for All Initiative, which uses remote sensing, AI and analytics to enhance disaster preparedness and response. As climate impacts intensify, such efforts will save lives, protect livelihoods and build resilience in developing countries. Three, promoting inclusivity in science and solutions. Science has, for too long, been a relatively closed shop. This must change. We must use every piece of knowledge \u2013 from respected scientists to indigenous women to youth. This is how we find solutions that work. This is why UNEP is collaborating with The International Science Council to bring impactful diversity to science and solutions. Friends, We have the science and technology. And we have the tools to collaborate. UNEP is using them to ensure developing nations have the technology they need for a brighter future. Through the Climate Technology Centre and Network. Through the SE4All Africa Hub for energy solutions. Through the Kigali Cooling Efficiency programme. And so much more. Now we must all do more. Through the impetus provided by today\u2019s deliberations of the G77+China. Through putting technology in the hands of people through digital public infrastructure. Through using STI to prepare for the future. Through bringing the wisdom of all groups to the table. Above all, through putting in the hard yards to create a greener, safer and more equitable world for everyone.","filter_flag":1}

The roadmap responds to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s recent findings, backed by the United Nations, that drastic action must be taken \u201cnow or never\u201d in order to avoid \u201cdisaster\u201d. A new survey from Ipsos, commissioned by Mars, also consulted adult participants across the UK, Germany, France, China, Japan, India, and the USA; 69% believed businesses should invest the same amount (32%) or more (37%) of their efforts into tackling climate change than current economic challenges. Additionally, almost half of respondents held multinational businesses and governments responsible for addressing climate change. As such, Mars has outlined its plans as an open-source strategy, hoping that other companies use the roadmap to pursue its own net zero goals \u2013 placing action over commitments, making tangible progress, and removing or offsetting all emissions with decisive action and high-quality carbon credits. Mars intends to invest $1 billion over the next three years and continually commit financial resources wherever necessary until greenhouse gases are significantly reduced, with other emissions that cannot be eliminated balanced by removals. Its emissions footprint is currently said to match that of a country the size of Finland and the company plans to halve its carbon emissions in absolute terms by 2030, cutting out around 15 million metric tons in a target reviewed by the Science Based Targets Initiative. In order to achieve net zero, it plans to transition into 100% renewable energy. This will involve powering its factories, offices, and veterinary hospitals with alternate energy sources \u2013 addressing energy used by its farmers, how the company sources its ingredients, and how energy is used by retailers and consumers. Logistics will serve as another area of focus. The company will look into the electrification of vehicles, potentially utilising green hydrogen, and other methods of redesigning its networks, methods of transportation, and finding new energy sources for its operations. It is also set to embed climate reductions into the planning of its governance and business by including it as a shareholder objective, in variable remuneration plans of senior executives, investment planning processes, its merger and acquisition strategy, and more. Alongside redesigning its supply chains to enhance the transparency and traceability of key ingredients and prevent deforestation, Mars seeks to scale up initiatives in smart climate agriculture, including regenerative agriculture, sourcing optimisation, and a transition into renewables. It also plans to optimise its recipes to use less carbon-intensive ingredients in its products. According to the company, it peaked emissions in 2018 and has since reduced greenhouse gases in absolute terms by 8%, or 2.6 million metric tons, against a 2015 baseline while expanding the business by 60%. \u201c2050 can seem to be in the distant future, but the progress we make in the next seven years is critical,\u201d said Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch. \u201cMy generation of CEOs has the ability and responsibility to deliver actual emission reductions and put business on a clear path to Net Zero by 2050. \u201cThat\u2019s why Mars is committed to delivering a 50% reduction in GHG by 2030. We cannot wait for the economy to improve; we must push forward with investments that protect our business today and in the future. \u201cAs I have said before, profit and purpose are not enemies. Investment in climate is not a trade-off between planet and productivity, or between environment and employment. Consumers and our Associates clearly want both \u2013 and so do we. Investing in emissions reductions is sound business policy, it is achievable, affordable, and it is absolutely necessary. \u201cCompanies must be judged \u2013 Mars included \u2013 on the actual results we deliver against our climate plans, not just the scale of the commitment we make \u2013 just as we are judged by our boards and investors on the delivery of financial results, not the quality of our financial forecasts.\u201d Barry Parkin, Mars chief sustainability and procurement officer, added: \u201cMars has always followed the science, and the science says we must cut our emissions across our full value chain by 50% by 2030. Science points us to five fundamentals that Net Zero roadmaps should consider to deliver real impact, for example that there is no place for exclusions or exceptions and that we must prioritize performance over promises. \u201cIn preparing our roadmap, we\u2019ve learned that this is both entirely possible to deliver with existing science and technology as well as entirely affordable. We can both grow our business and cut emissions. I hope our roadmap clearly and powerfully demonstrates what Mars is doing and, critically, what we believe needs to happen at scale to help tackle the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d Earlier this year, Smurfit Kappa reported that it has reduced CO2 emissions by 43.9% since 2005, which is thought to keep the company on track for its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Taylor, director of sustainability at UPM Raflatac, also spoke to Packaging Europe about its own action plan in the pursuit of sustainable operations. This includes joining The Climate Pledge in a bid to achieve net zero by 2040 and unveiling new products that claim to offer customers a lower carbon footprint. Similarly, Apple is seeking full decarbonisation by 2030 and working towards its own \u2018low-carbon\u2019 transportation and label application processes with the rollout of its new Apple Watch line. It will ship at least 50% of the combined weight using non-air modes of transport and has developed a custom, high-resolution printer that can print directly onto the back of its boxes \u2013 a method expected to cut down on 3700 metric tons of carbon emissions.

As our judges discovered in The Vodka Masters 2023, the reason for this is quality liquid made with care and passion. Vodka remains to be the leading spirit in sales and volume in the US, according to data from the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. The vodka category in the US generated US$7.2 billion in revenue in 2022, down by 0.3% year on year, while its volume fell by 1.5% to 76.9 million nine-litre cases. While sales appear to be stagnant for the category in the US, producers continue to invest in new products, capitalising on trends such as sustainability, low-ABV and provenance. Even ready-to-drink brands, such as White Claw and Truly, have made moves into the vodka category as demand for hard seltzers falters. The future is also bright for products at the higher end of the price bracket. The IWSR said the premium-and-above vodka segment has seen more positive growth, expanding in volume consumption by 6% in 2022, with an expected compound annual growth rate of 3% in volume from 2022 to 2027. This year\u2019s Vodka Masters headed to the Hippodrome in London, where three panels of judges were tasked with dishing out medals to worthy entrants. The first panel was formed of: chair David T Smith, spirits consultant, writer and co\u2010founder of the Craft Distilling Expo; Claire Filer of The Filer Files; Anne Jones, drinks expert at Waitrose; and Marie Cheong-Thong of The Larder at 36. The second panel was chaired by Bryan Rodriguez-Curtis, wine and spirits buyer at Harvey Nichols, who was joined by: Antony Moss MW; Evan Prousaefs, bar manager at Sexy Fish in London; and Tatti Sukamongkol, wine and spirits specialist, and contributor to Malt Review. Melita Kiely, editor of The Spirits Business, and chair of The Global Spirits Masters Competitions (GMSC) led the third panel, which included: Matt Chambers, spirits writer and co-founder of the Whisky For Everyone blog; Joyce Chou, Wine & Spirit Education Trust\u2019s translation project manager; Zaloren Gonzalez Fontes, assistant manager of Hometipple; and Herchelle Perez Terrado, founder of Drinks Partnership. The first round, Standard (priced up to \u00a310), saw Count Pushkin Premium Imperial Vodka win a Gold, praised for its \u201cpleasant lemon, touch of tonka on the nose and dried vanilla\u201d. Moving up the price bracket to vodkas priced between \u00a311 and \u00a320 was where the first Master of the day was discovered. Stock Prestige Vodka took home the top award, enjoyed by Jones for its \u201clovely smooth texture, lightly floral, plenty of character and peppery spice but very soft and approachable \u2013 great value\u201d. Four Golds and a Silver were also awarded. Among the Gold medallists were Cruz Vodka Vintage Black, with its \u201cbright nose and lovely viscosity\u201d, and Absolut Original, with its \u201cvanilla ice cream on the nose, good texture and a hint of liquorice\u201d. Filer said of the Premium flight: \u201cA flight with impressive quality, considering the value of the products; some still have the distinctive \u2018cheap vodka\u2019 flavour and texture, but some present a balance and complexity that is impressive for the price point.\u201d Two Masters were found in the following flight, Super Premium, which gave medals to vodkas priced between \u00a321 and \u00a330. Master-winning Discarded Grape Skin Vodka was praised by Smith for its \u201cfloral bubblegum notes with tart tannic grape notes, lots of almond and cherry\u201d. Also taking home the top award was 8 Mile Vodka, which Perez Terrado said offered: \u201cClean, grapefruit aroma, great body and mouthfeel around the tongue, followed by delightful peppery heat balance with light bitter astringency.\u201d Nine Golds were also discovered, including one for Pravda, which offered \u201cfloral grain notes, an absolutely superb texture, bit of pepperiness, but nice and full with crisp grain notes\u201d. Other Golds went to Koskenkorva Vodka Climate Action, enjoyed for its \u201cdelicate sweetness and hints of white chocolate and earthy spice\u201d, the \u201csweet and earthy\u201d Jean Marc XO Vodka, and the \u201cclean and crisp\u201d White Claw Spirits Triple Wave Filtered Premium Vodka. Smith called the flight a \u201cstep up in interest and complexity from the previous category, with a more developed character from some of these products\u201d. The highest price bracket, Ultra Premium, was the most successful flight of the contest with five Master medals being awarded. The first went to Desi Daru Mango Vodka, which Rodriguez-Curtis enjoyed for its \u201cfleshy and vibrant\u201d nose. He said: \u201cThe palate is smooth, pleasant, good level of mango flavour and good level of enjoyability. The mango has a brilliant freshness. Chilled out of the fridge or freezer, this vodka would be brilliant to enjoy.\u201d Louers Vodka walked away with the top award, described by Prousaefs as having: \u201cLemon peel and freshly cut grass on the nose. Excellent mouthfeel with very long aftertaste and a hint of bitterness at the end.\u201d Banks and Bloom Ice Vodka impressed Filer, who said: \u201cSoft nose with some creamy vanilla, lemon and grain. A smooth and oily mouthfeel with a saline element, and a balanced profile of peppery grain with sweet citrus, and no disruptive heat.\u201d Absolut Elyx also took home a Master, impressing Rodriguez-Curtis with its \u201cclean nose, lemon and ripe stone fruit. The palate has a pleasant mouthfeel, good texture and well balanced alcohol\u201d. Completing the Master line-up was Ewe Whey Vodka, with Filer calling its \u201crich, nutty, malty nose, like a sweet beer ferment. On the palate \u2013 similar notes, nutty malt, some caramel sweetness, hints of milk chocolate, some balancing citrus and pepper. Warming texture.\u201d Smooth palate Eleven Golds were given out, including one to Neft Vodka, enjoyed for its \u201csmooth palate with a nice body and texture\u201d, and Sapling Climate Positive Vodka, with its nose of \u201cfresh and toasted grain\u201d and \u201cnutty sweetness\u201d on the palate. Other Gold winners included: Into the Wild Vodka, with its \u201cclean and neutral nose\u201d and \u201cspice and pepper\u201d; \u201ccreamy and sippable\u201d Tanzanite Vodka with its \u201ctouch of crushed pine needle freshness and lime zest\u201d; \u201csoft and floral\u201d Riverland Rose Vodka; and Incognito Vodka, with its \u201ccreamy sweetness and tangy citrus\u201d on the palate. Moving on to vodkas with different bases, and a flight of Grain Blend bottlings were sampled next. Golds were given to Meili Vodka, with its \u201cvanilla and white chocolate\u201d aroma, and Short Story Grain Vodka, described as \u201ctangy and vibrant\u201d with \u201clots of lime zest and a hint of fresh basil\u201d. Silver medal winner Pur Sang completed the flight. A single entry in the potato-based vodka round saw Nine Tines take a Gold, enjoyed for its \u201csweetness on the nose and palate, and nice balance \u2013 would be great sipped neat, or in a Martini\u201d. Pulse Vodka won a Silver in the following flight, Vodka Base \u2013 Corn. Meanwhile, Pod Pea Vodka was the worthy recipient of a Master medal in the Vodka Base \u2013 Pea round. Chou particularly enjoyed this expression: \u201cExpressive green, grassy, leafy, lactic notes on the nose. Very complex, with sweet caramel on the palate.\u201d The Smooth flight saw Desi Daru Mango Vodka take home another Master, enjoyed for its \u201clovely juicy mango on the nose\u201d and \u201cwarming and smooth texture without excessive heat\u201d. The \u201cbright and elegant\u201d Muff Vodka and Altumura Vodka with its \u201cluxurious texture\u201d took home Gold medals. Desi Daru Mango Vodka secured its third Master medal, in the Microdistillery flight. Chambers said: \u201cTonnes of fresh mango on nose, fresh pulp with bitterness from skin, soft and sweet on the palate, with a very complex flavour profile, lots of fresh mango \u2013 this is great to experience, compared with something more confected. It\u2019s juicy and delicious, with a delicate peppery note underneath.\u201d Two Silvers were also awarded in the flight. Meanwhile, a trio of Master medals were found in the Organic flight. The first went to Pluto Vodka, described by Rodriguez-Curtis as being \u201csmooth, very well done, rounded, creamy and enjoyable. It would work in a killer Martini\u201d. Prousaefs was particularly enamoured of Summum Single Estate Vodka: \u201cVery smooth, crisp and light on the nose and palate. Super easy going and easy to drink, with an almost excellent mouthfeel and lasting finish.\u201d Nykur Super Premium Organic Vodka completed the Master streak. Rodriguez-Curtis said: \u201cThe palate is fantastic, the alcohol is perfectly integrated, balanced well and the texture rounded. The slightly higher alcohol adds to the texture. It feels grown-up and premium, like a vodka you want to enjoy in a Martini.\u201d A Gold was given to Grainger\u2019s Deluxe Organic Vodka, and a Silver was awarded to Koskenkorva Vodka Organic. A hat-trick of Golds was discovered in the Europe fight, including one to Ostoya Vodka, described as \u201cclean, elegant, with green grass and a touch of spice\u201d. Neft and Altamura Vodka also secured Golds. The next flight, Scandinavia, saw Anora Group\u2019s Koskenkorva Vodka Original win a Silver medal. Eastern Europe saw Dima\u2019s Vodka from Ukraine grab a Gold, praised for its \u201clemon and green apple on the nose\u201d and \u201cnutty and savoury mouthfeel\u201d. A Silver went to Flirt Vodka from Bulgaria. The Rest of the World round awarded two Golds and two Silver medals. Gold winner Meili Vodka was described as \u201ccomforting and rich\u201d, with \u201clemon rind, cacao nibs and a hint of dried vanilla\u201d on the nose. Fellow Gold medallist The Community Spirit Vodka offered a \u201ccrisp and clean nose\u201d and a \u201clong and lingering finish\u201d. The largest flight of the competition, Flavoured\/Infused Vodka, saw Desi Daru Mango Vodka come out on top. Jones said that it offered: \u201cLovely natural mango aromas and more pulpy on the palate with a hint of tannic structure. Smooth and well-integrated alcohol.\u201d Six Golds and 13 Silvers were also awarded. Koskenkorva won three Golds for its 7 Botanicals, Lemon Lime Yarrow, and Sauna Barrel expressions. Gold winner Maple Vodka was lauded for its \u201cmaple syrup and caramel on the nose\u201d and \u201csweet and syrupy palate\u201d. Other Gold medallists included Absolut Peppar, with its \u201cfresh, savoury and pepper aroma\u201d, and Sapling Zero Waste Raspberry + Hibiscus Vodka, with flavours of raspberry and a \u201chint of tropical, late peppery spice\u201d. Filer offered some insight into flavoured vodkas: \u201cSome wild variation in quality in this round, with some very good examples of flavoured vodkas, and, sadly, some poorly balanced and artificial-tasting examples. More care could be taken in production in this category.\u201d Chou noted: \u201cI can see some very expressive combinations of flavours, and some of them did very well in bringing different flavour profiles. The fruity ones were a little bit watered down, and too fake. But the more herbal, savoury ones did very well. There were expressive characters.\u201d Three Silvers were given out in the penultimate flight, Flavoured\/Infused Vodka-Based Spirit Drink, including two for White Claw Spirits Co. The final flight of the day, Vodka Liqueur, saw a Gold go to Edwards 1902 x Bottlegreen Elderflower Liqueur. It was praised for its \u201clight elderflower notes\u201d and \u201cgood acidity\u201d. But the tasting didn\u2019t end there, as judges were tasked with choosing the best liquid of the day. A retaste of the highest scorers saw Desi Daru Mango Vodka selected as this year\u2019s Vodka Taste Master. As evidenced by our Taste Master winner, perhaps a renewed focus on flavours from vodka producers will help to drive growth of the category.

Earlier this week, the company started working with two Australian institutions: The University of Technology Sydney and The University of Sydney Union. Refilled's strategy involves replacing a significant number of these vending machines with its new BYO-Bottle system. The company plans to capitalise on the trend of reusable bottles by providing consumers with a wide range of flavoured and nutritionally enriched options beyond plain tap water. The business has developed 'Refillers,' a fusion between a fridge and a \"giant\" SodaStream, offering chilled still and sparkling drinks in various flavours. These beverages can be further customised with optional boosters like caffeine, vitamins and exercise-oriented nootropics. Refilled aims to build and install 100 Refillers machines by 2024. This initiative is said to eliminate over 1 million single-use plastic bottles from polluting our environment or filling up landfills every year. In addition, it aims to eliminate 100 million single-use plastic bottles by 2030. According to the company, a single Refiller has the capacity to stock ten times more beverages than a standard vending machine. Consequently, it can \"dramatically reduce waste\" and lower emissions produced by frequent deliveries and restocking of traditional beverages. Moreover, Refilled is employing technology to track the number of saved bottles in real time. It has introduced reusable bottles featuring QR codes that can be scanned at the Refiller to pay for drinks, eliminating the need for cards, phones or cash. Refilled founder and CEO Ryan Nelson said: \"Refilled is transforming the ordinary, everyday act of drinking water into climate action. Most people have good intentions and want to do good for the planet, but not everyone can afford to buy an electric vehicle or install solar panels.\" He continued: \"Armed with just a reusable bottle and a couple of bucks, our Refillers offer an affordable, achievable way to eliminate plastic pollution. If we can replace even a fraction of drink vending machines, which are an outrageous source of plastic waste, we will stop millions of plastic bottles going to landfills.\" University of Sydney Union president, Naz Sharifi, added: \"As part of our ongoing efforts to expand our sustainable practices and reduce the usage of single-use plastic bottles, we are thrilled to be partnering with Refilled, who share our social, environmental and ecological aspirations. This will allow our members access to filling stations in key locations around campus.\"","filter_flag":1}

Mettler is Vice President, Europe, at Breakthrough Energy, working on cleantech innovation in pursuit of a net-zero-emissions future. Before her current role, she worked for many years in European public policy. She was head of the European Political Strategy Center, the in-house think tank of the European Commission, from 2014 to 2019. In this podcast, she covers topics including the following: Investing for climate impact The challenges in Europe\u2019s clean energy technological ecosystem Useful innovation beyond new products The new priority of energy security accelerating the net-zero transition Janet Bush (co-host): Michael, looking at new challenges we face in the energy arena\u2014the invasion of Ukraine, the spike in inflation, worries about energy supply chains\u2014are you more or less optimistic about the net-zero transition? Michael Chui (co-host): If I am being honest, I am not sure whether we will get to the 1.5 degrees target that some people have put out there. Nevertheless, there are some optimistic signs about diversifying away from fossil fuels. Janet Bush: In Europe, at least, our guest today is very much in the optimistic camp. She looks at the recent disruptions and thinks it\u2019s going to accelerate our progress. Michael Chui: I look forward to listening in to the conversation. Janet Bush: Welcome to the podcast, Ann. Ann Mettler: It\u2019s great to be here. Thank you for having me, Janet. Janet Bush: You\u2019re very welcome. So listen, we always like our listeners to know a little bit about you, where you came from, your childhood, where you were educated, and how did you end up in public policy. Subscribe to the Forward Thinking podcast Ann Mettler: It\u2019s a long story. In terms of my background, I\u2019m a quintessential European. I have a German father, a Swedish mom. I was born in Sweden but raised in Germany. I\u2019m a child of the 70s, so my dream was always to study in the United States. That wasn\u2019t very easy in the early 1990s. So I decided to sort of take a short cut and actually begin my studies at the American College in Greece. So I moved to Athens. I was 19, studied there for two years, studied business. I thought, at the time, I wanted to study business, but then realized I actually wanted to study political science. Then I managed to get a scholarship at the University of New Mexico. I moved from Athens to Albuquerque, in New Mexico, where I first received a bachelor\u2019s and then a master\u2019s degree. I really wanted to move to Washington, DC, and really experience politics. So I just packed my bags and moved to DC. I got very, very lucky in the sense that I ended up working for a senator, John Glenn, the former astronaut. That year in Washington, DC, was transformative for me because I got to really experience public policy in a way that I just hadn\u2019t. But it also really gave me the urge to want to go back to Europe. So I moved to Bonn, Germany, for a year. I got my second master\u2019s. And then, bizarrely, I actually ended up moving to Switzerland. I got a very attractive job offer at the World Economic Forum. I started out in the North America team but then was made, at the time, the youngest director ever, in charge of the Europe department. It was an incredible opportunity. By then, I was in my early 30s. And my lifelong dream\u2014and I consider myself, really, an entrepreneur at heart\u2014was to run my own organization. So I quit my job after a few years and decided that I was going to co-found a think tank in Brussels. It\u2019s called the Lisbon Council. The slogan was \u201cMaking Europe fit for the future.\u201d I\u2019ve always thought a lot about preparing Europe for the future. And I ran the think tank for 11 years, until I was approached by the team that supported the new incoming president of the European Commission back in 2019, Jean-Claude Juncker. They asked me if I wanted to run the European Political Strategy Center, the in-house think tank. I became a director general in the European Commission, came in from the outside at the highest level. It was really quite daunting, I have to say. But I was very glad to serve the entire term of five years. Towards the end of that time, I was approached by the private office of Bill Gates to see if I wanted to open up an office in Europe for them to work on energy and climate change, which, as you know, Bill Gates very much cares about, and really was looking to Europe as a best practice in climate policy and in the energy transition. So I decided to accept that offer. Janet Bush: It\u2019s very interesting that you worked in Europe when the large enlargement happened and our Eastern European neighbors came into the European Union. Looking back, it was challenging at the time. How do you see it now? Ann Mettler: Honestly, that moment with the Big Bang Enlargement was a moment just so ripe with opportunity. We thought democracy had prevailed, and now this was going to be the foremost governance system, that the entire world would embrace. And I think today, we\u2019re in a very different spot. I think public policy is probably always very intense. But I feel like we are just living through changes that are so profound that sometimes it can be really difficult to even wrap your minds around it. It was difficult at the time to always understand what is on the horizon. And I won\u2019t lie about it, it was oftentimes unsettling, because we didn\u2019t like a lot of what we saw coming. Janet Bush: So, talking about big issues and uncertainty, you are now engaged in the business of climate change, sustainability, cleantech. That has to be the biggest challenge for all of us. Ann Mettler: Absolutely. And this is maybe one thing to say, that towards the end of my time at the Commission\u2014this would have been 2018, 2019\u2014it was very evident for me that at least with regards to the EU, that the energy transition was going to be the biggest thing going forward. And I wanted, with all my heart, to help Europe to succeed in this cleantech revolution. And I say it as someone who accompanied Europe pretty much from the very beginning of the internet till now, and seeing how Europe just fell further and further behind when it came to digital technologies. Janet Bush: Tell our listeners about Breakthrough Energy, what you\u2019re doing. Ann Mettler: Breakthrough Energy is an extremely eclectic and interesting organization. It\u2019s very much a brainchild of Bill Gates. It is about investment, but not investment in a traditional sense\u2014with a return-on-investment frame of mind, but the investment thesis is very much centered around the climate impact. So, the technologies that we invest in, what is their potential at scale? And we will only invest if we believe that it has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by half a gigaton a year. It\u2019s a very high threshold for an investment. So it\u2019s investment, but done differently. Number two, it\u2019s also philanthropy. You asked about my job. When I look at Europe, what Europe needs is perhaps not so much just to focus on climate, because broadly speaking, Europe gets this. However, where Europe lacks is in the innovation ecosystem. It\u2019s essentially in not only developing these technologies, but deploying them at scale. So a lot of our philanthropy is actually focused on the innovation ecosystem. Then I would say that the third element is really very centered around public policy, because in energy, you don\u2019t lift a finger without having to focus on what\u2019s the regulatory and public policy environment. Coming back to my own work, we are sort of a microcosm of the larger organization in the United States, but also very focused on the particular challenges that Europe has. And as I said, in Europe, broadly speaking, there\u2019s consensus that climate change is real. We have very ambitious targets. We have climate law. All of that is in place. But we really need to show up our performance when it comes to scaling up these technologies. And this is what I\u2019m committed to do. Janet Bush: What are the shortcomings of the ecosystem, the technological ecosystem in Europe that is needed to make this happen? Ann Mettler: I wish there was one. But broadly speaking, if you look at an innovation cycle, it goes from development to deployment, scaling up. And Europe is very strong in the early stages of the innovation cycle. And that\u2019s a real strength. Breakthrough innovations, technologies will come out of Europe. Where things then go astray is a little bit beyond the R&D phase. We\u2019re getting better at producing promising start-ups, but where then things really break down is in the scaling up. Europe does not have a great track record in helping young companies to grow big. And that is becoming a problem. It\u2019s really very much around the deployment of the technology, rather than just the development. And that\u2019s what I spend a lot of my time on. I would say more recently that Europe has also lost some leadership in manufacturing, frankly. I\u2019m very concerned, if I can say that right now, about the wind industry. Europe stood up the solar energy and lost that, and Europe also helped stand up the wind industry, including offshore wind. And I worry that we are sleepwalking into a situation where we will lose the wind industry as well. So that\u2019s problematic. I think that we really need to have this on our radar screen. Janet Bush: You talked about Europe\u2019s opportunity in cleantech. The commitment\u2019s there. The opportunity was there. Do you think that the opportunity is lost, or can it be regained? Ann Mettler: It\u2019s not lost. Nothing\u2019s ever lost. And Europe will always have niche areas where it can be strong. But broadly speaking, and if I look now on the other side of the Atlantic, and the transformative changes that have been brought about by the Inflation Reduction Act, which really has put the US on the cleantech agenda in a very short period of time, then I worry that Europe is not necessarily maybe losing ground, but others are getting faster, because we\u2019re not standing still. This is one thing that I realize, in comparing to when I started my job back in early 2020. Europe was really sort of a leader. But that was before every other geography got into the cleantech game. My point is the entire world is looking right now, \u201cHow can I get a piece of this pie?\u201d So it\u2019s not necessarily that Europe is falling behind so much that others are going faster and are being more ambitious. And this is what we\u2019re trying to remedy. Janet Bush: What is it about Europe that makes it so slow at things? Ann Mettler: It is slow. But I will also say when it does move, it\u2019s a little bit like a tanker. It won\u2019t move fast, but when it does move, it is palpable. And so I always want to give the EU the benefit of the doubt. It is cumbersome. It is slow. But I believe we need to find the solutions within the system. Janet Bush: So when you look at the innovation that is happening in Europe, what most excites you? Give us some examples. Ann Mettler: There are amazing start-ups. I said before that cleantech plays to Europe\u2019s strength. We have a very strong industrial base. We have deep expertise in deep tech and engineering. We have a lot of entrepreneurs who really worry about climate change. They are really dedicated. So there isn\u2019t one sort of innovation that I am excited about. It\u2019s more the nascent ecosystem around these technologies that I am trying to strengthen by connecting the start-ups at the technology frontier with bigger corporate players. This is what I consider my job. However, I will also say\u2014and I thought a lot about what kind of innovation Europe needs\u2014I think we are too stuck with an intellectual paradigm that looks at innovation in cleantech as if we were developing sort of a new iPhone. That\u2019s not the case. If I look at what kind of innovation Europe needs, it can be much more around speeding up certain developments. How do I speed up processes? How do I deploy technology faster through process innovation? What kind of innovation do I need to be able to mass manufacture again? Also, using the same standards, and thereby accelerate the deployment of a technology? The point that I\u2019m making, what I\u2019m learning about cleantech, is that oftentimes, because the innovation is so undifferentiated that we need to take a different path than we sometimes do in other areas of innovation. What do I mean with that? So for instance, if you fly on an airplane that flies with sustainable aviation fuels, it won\u2019t palpably feel different than if you fly on an airplane with kerosene. So you won\u2019t have the typical sort of user experience, right, that underpins an innovation, a product innovation. But you will have a much more expensive airplane ticket. An innovation can be, \u201cHow do we manage to increase to scale to bring down the cost?\u201d What Bill Gates calls \u201cthe green premium.\u201d That can be an innovation, too. So I\u2019m trying to sort of steer the debate more into what kind of innovation do we need so that we get out of our paradigm that an innovation always needs to be a new product. Janet Bush: Are you making progress on that front? Ann Mettler: Yes. Absolutely. We\u2019re seeing now that speeding up permitting has become a major issue. We\u2019re seeing that policy levers that can be deployed to reduce the cost of clean energies, such as what\u2019s called carbon contracts for difference. This is where the government pays the difference between a CO 2 -intensive product versus a clean product, so that you start using the clean product. So carbon contracts are different. There are some exciting developments in Germany. The next frontier here is to bring back some manufacturing capacity. But still, it\u2019s still too slow. It doesn\u2019t scale fast enough. So this is where, really, we need to focus in on the speed, the scale, the simplicity. These regulations have to speak to companies so that they have confidence in investing. So this is what I would be focusing on if I were still in my old job. Janet Bush: The three Ss, very important. So putting all of this into the context of a more fractured world, a more contested world, a less certain world, a world with inflation for the first time in 20 years, and the rest of it, a world with Russia and Ukraine, how does this impact the chances of cleantech and, in general, the net-zero transition unfolding as it should? Ann Mettler: My prediction is that it will accelerate the energy transition. And, at least here in Europe, when natural gas became weaponized by Russia against us, it was very clear that we would have an urgency to get off fossil energy, and natural gas in particular, that we had never felt before. I wanted to use that opportunity and really, really, really use it to accelerate the energy transition because honestly, between the urgency of climate change and the urgency of a war that is based on the weaponization of energy, if you cannot muster the resolve to really speed things up then, then I don\u2019t know if you ever can. I was, at the time, and I continue to be optimistic, that it will accelerate the energy transition away from fossil energy. But, I think there\u2019s no global consensus around it. And so the question is, \u201cWhat do we do about this?\u201d I personally believe that climate action has always been plagued by a collective action problem, that those that moved ahead the fastest thought that if others don\u2019t pull along, that it is too much of a risk. I think that perception is changing now, and that essentially now that energy has become a security issue, that prioritizing what I call energy resilience will become an overriding focus. And I think that, at least in Europe and the United States, that\u2019s been understood. Janet Bush: It\u2019s very interesting that MGI did some work called The complication of concentration in global trade. And it shows that many countries source what they need from a very, very small number of trading partners. And we\u2019re seeing that changing, because people know that they have to diversify for resilience. But we\u2019re also seeing, in some cases, new oil licenses being granted, new coal-fired power stations being built in different parts of the world. So there\u2019s an element of going back to fossil fuels at the same time as forging ahead with clean energy. Ann Mettler: Yes. I don\u2019t dispute that, which is why I believe our approach is so important, because essentially, unless you can make a business case that the clean energy is the better energy, I think this is going to be exceedingly difficult. For instance, the renewables have now proven themselves. They\u2019re cost competitive. They\u2019re cheaper than fossil energy. And this is the promise of standing up a new generation of clean technologies, because imagine how much less hope we would have today if we didn\u2019t have renewables, if we didn\u2019t have wind, solar, if we didn\u2019t have batteries\u2014but also how much more hope the world would have if we had green hydrogen at scale, if we had sustainable fuels, if we had carbon dioxide removal technologies, if we had long-duration energy storage, if we had geothermal at scale. My point is really, from a policy perspective, my recommendation is focus on the business case, make it profitable to do the clean energy business, and then, essentially, things will fall into place. But we don\u2019t have time. Climate change is a reality. With wind and solar, it took 40 years. What took 40 years in the past, we now need to do this decade. It\u2019s a tall order. Janet Bush: It\u2019s interesting. A previous podcast guest was Claire O\u2019Neill, who was the British representative at COP in Glasgow. And she said it was interesting that in the final communiqu\u00e9, business wasn\u2019t even mentioned. The word \u201cbusiness\u201d did not appear. But is it business, really, that is going to make the change? Ann Mettler: I don\u2019t think we can bring about the desired change without business, so it\u2019s not sufficient on its own. I will also say that business is not some homogeneous lump. Business is a multitude of actors. What I have been focusing on recently is more at the interplay of large industry players and start-ups at the technology frontier. I think this is not sufficiently explored, because especially energy\u2014and I hope no one will take offense\u2014on balance, energy is an innovation-poor sector. One must, in fairness, say, energy has never been told to be very innovative. The goal of energy was be cheap and be reliable. And broadly speaking, that\u2019s what was supplied. This is what we got. Now, we have all sorts of expectations in the energy sector on what they should do. And this is why I\u2019m saying bringing them together with these start-ups that are working on these breakthrough innovations and breakthrough technologies is really a fruitful way of going about. And what I learned, and it\u2019s anecdotal, but I know that, for instance, in China, big corporations get subsidies from the government to work closely with start-ups. And then they take these breakthrough innovations and technologies and bring them back into the big company, which of course has global value chains, has just capacities that a small business doesn\u2019t have. I think we need to understand better how we can bring the innovative prowess in these young companies into the bigger companies and then help them to jointly scale the technologies and bring the innovations to market. I know that in Europe, this has not been sufficiently explored. It has not been sufficiently incentivized. So oftentimes, let\u2019s be very clear about this, when we talk about business, we talk about economic industry incumbents. More often than not, they are not the ones at the technology frontier. They are often the ones that feel very threatened by new technologies. They fear the disruption that innovation brings. So I think we need to be more nuanced in our approach to business. We can\u2019t do it without them, but we must show that we really bring the totality of business, and here in particular those that are at the technology frontier, really around the table. Janet Bush: It\u2019s exactly the same in biotech, by the way, the same thing as in cleantech. There\u2019s a lot of innovation in Europe. You can\u2019t scale it. You can\u2019t commercialize it. There isn\u2019t an ecosystem. Same thing. Ann Mettler: The best example of that is BioNTech, which developed the mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 but essentially couldn\u2019t mass manufacture it, which is how they ended up collaborating with Pfizer. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying\u2014here it was incentivized. We understood what are the strengths of each player and brought them together in conducive ways. Why can this not be done in energy? Janet Bush: Are you seeing movement on that front in Europe and in the US? Ann Mettler: In the US, yes. And one thing that I really like about the IRA is it does not discriminate. You deploy the technology, you will get your tax credit. In Europe, the subsidies are, at the European level, handed out through what are called the IPCEIs\u2014Important Projects of Common European Interest. More often than not, these are big industry players, there\u2019s a really lengthy process to qualify, et cetera. I don\u2019t experience, per se, that the environment for cleantech start-ups is super empowering in Europe, that they have the same access to subsidies, or to public policy, for that matter. So I think we really stand to improve here. And as I said, this is not only about the start-ups. This is really about this interplay really bringing the right actors together so that we can deploy, because let\u2019s face it, you have a new company that\u2019s sort of an exciting start-up in, let\u2019s say, low-carbon cement. Until they can really rival the four to six global companies that dominate the cement market, it will take, at a minimum, a decade, if not more. We need to think creatively. How do we do this in a much more fruitful way? There should be a lot of opportunity in Europe because we have a lot of big global industry players. So we have what we need. We have the start-ups. We have those players. But we have no systems to bring them together and to really create meaningful projects that have the policy support, the focus. Also, from a derisking perspective, so that they can then deploy the technology and scale faster, much faster than they otherwise would. Janet Bush: So beyond the system points, which I absolutely see, is there enough money going into cleantech, overall? Ann Mettler: There\u2019s obviously never enough money, but probably not. I\u2019ll give you an example. If I look at Europe, since the beginning of the [Russia-Ukraine] war, European governments have subsidized the continued use of fossil energy to the tune of \u20ac600 billion. We have a project that we call the Energy Resilience Leadership Group. There is a fabulous company that has come out of X, the Google accelerator that does long-duration energy storage in coal mines. And they need about \u20ac2 billion to deploy this technology. Two billion euros sounds like an unbelievable amount of money. And it is. It is for an individual start-up. But then if you compare that to the \u20ac600 billion, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. What I\u2019m missing is a master plan\u2014being much more strategic. Of course, we were in a complete crisis situation, a panic situation in Europe\u2014you really can\u2019t say it any other way\u2014after the war started and we were looking at a winter with real distress. So I get it. But now, we are in year two of the war. We need to start shifting away and really deploying a lot more money into these emerging clean technologies. It\u2019s just a fact that it costs a lot of money and that for these individual companies, it\u2019s too much of a risk, including for a lot of investors. So we need to think of ways that we can socialize these risks, because honestly, especially in this summer, where we\u2019ve had a lot of extreme weather events, however much this would cost, the cost will pale in comparison to what these extreme weather events will cost over time. So as I said, it\u2019s never enough money. And we need to deploy that money in a much smarter way than I think we have done to date. Janet Bush: What do you mean by \u201csocialize the risks\u201d? Ann Mettler: That means that right now, that if you are an investor and you come across very promising clean technologies, you shoulder a lot of that risk. And then, this is without any sort of understanding, \u201cIs there a market on the other side of this? Will I really be making money? When will I be making money?\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If you have a traditional return-on-investment perspective, a lot of these technologies continue to be very risky. And this is where governments need to step in\u2014and, in fairness, do step in\u2014and try to derisk. But it\u2019s too slow moving. I remember when I started my job and I saw that Europe was really doubling down on renewables, which of course is completely laudable. But I\u2019m like, \u201cHow is this supposed to work without long-duration energy storage? Because both wind and solar are intermittent sources of energy. So what do you do if there\u2019s no wind and there\u2019s no sun?\u201d But back then, at least, long-duration energy storage was not on the radar screen at all. I remember talking to previous colleagues and saying, \u201cWe need targets. We need funds. We need to make this a big policy priority.\u201d Now, we\u2019re getting there, but it\u2019s pretty slow moving, I have to say, all things considered. And the same on green hydrogen. We\u2019ve spoken so much about green hydrogen, but it\u2019s not really deploying. There\u2019s not really a market. No one\u2019s really buying it. We really need a reality check and not just have ever-more-ambitious targets, but really looking at what are the final investment decisions, is anyone buying these clean technologies, and is there real demand? Because without that, only the clean technologies that are actually being used will decarbonize. If it\u2019s just something that exists in a lab, at the end of the day, it won\u2019t really make a difference. Janet Bush: What do you think would unlock the potential of green hydrogen? And who will unlock it? Ann Mettler: That\u2019s a good question. What I learned about green hydrogen is it\u2019s more complicated than, let\u2019s say, batteries. I was part of the team that put together the European Battery Alliance. And building a battery value chain, honestly, is peanuts compared to green hydrogen, because with green hydrogen, you\u2019re talking system change, and that\u2019s always extremely difficult to do. First of all, I think what no one really realized is that in order to have the green hydrogen, you need abundant and cheap renewable power, which only exists in very few places in Europe. So mostly in northern Sweden, and the Nordics more broadly, because of wind and hydropower, and then in the Iberian peninsula because of sun and wind. If you\u2019ve been really slow in the rollout of your renewables, chances are you\u2019re not going to be a leader in the production of green hydrogen. Then you need electrolyzers, which is a very nascent industry. Can we produce these electrolyzers at scale and at an affordable cost? Also big question mark. But that being said, we have great companies in Europe. Then you need to transport green hydrogen, which is notoriously difficult. So many issues that we need to think through. But one issue that I learned from my days in digital technologies that I would really encourage us to think about is, I saw this because Europe really had a very difficult time with the data economy because, as you know, the data protection, a very restricted use of data was only made possible. I worked on the artificial intelligence strategy at the time. And artificial intelligence was the flavor of the day. Everyone said, \u201cWe want to be leaders in artificial intelligence.\u201d And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen because if you cannot work with data, where does the intelligence in AI come from? It comes from volumes of data that you can aggregate.\u201d And I feel the same here. We want to be leaders in green hydrogen, but we\u2019ve been really slow for many years in the rollout of renewables. I\u2019m sorry, this is just sort of a reality check. And from a public policy perspective, I would very much encourage understanding a cascading effect that technologies can have, where new technologies build on an old or mature technology. And I think we don\u2019t sufficiently build that into our thinking and to our strategies. Janet Bush: What about the climate issue? Where are you on that? Optimistic, pessimistic? Ann Mettler: Optimistic, because you have to be optimistic. And I believe that the way to make progress is to lead, essentially, a race to the top, is to demonstrate that clean technologies are safer, better, make us more resilient. And that\u2019s the game that I\u2019m in. Janet Bush: What one piece of advice would you give to our listeners? Ann Mettler: Just to understand that the world is changing in profound ways. To really keep your eyes wide open, to not look at issues just from a unidimensional perspective.

This target is a Shareholder Objective. Mars is investing $1b over the next three years alone to drive climate action \u2014 from farm to table and pet food bowl, supply chain to store, and home to veterinary clinics. It comes as a major new Ipsos survey found on average 69% of adults across the world's seven largest economies think businesses focus on tackling climate change should be equal to or greater than tackling economic challenges. MCLEAN, Va. , Sept. 14, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Mars, Incorporated today released The Mars Net Zero Roadmap, a decisive action plan for achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its full value chain by 2050. The Mars Roadmap includes a new target reviewed by the Science Based Targets Initiative to cut emissions by 50% by 2030, from a 2015 baseline, with a pathway to Net Zero by 2050. MARS& PUBLISHES \"ACCELERATED, AFFORDABLE AND ACHIEVABLE\" NET ZERO ROADMAP TO CUT EMISSIONS 50% BY 2030 ACROSS FULL VALUE CHAIN The company peaked emissions in 2018, and has reduced GHGs in absolute terms by 8% or 2.6 million metric tons against a 2015 baseline, while growing the business 60% during that time.* As part of the action plan, Mars will invest over $1 billion over the next three years and continue to commit financial resources as needed until Net Zero is achieved. From the farms where food is grown for people and pets to the veterinary clinics where our pets are cared for, Mars is taking immediate action to reduce GHG emissions across its businesses to help build a better, more sustainable future for all. Net Zero refers to a state when greenhouse gases are significantly reduced while ensuring that any other emissions that can't be eliminated are balanced by removals. The roadmap comes after recent findings by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that it is \"now or never\" to take drastic action on climate change to avoid \"disaster.\" It comes as a major new Ipsos survey, commissioned by Mars, found that despite current difficult economic circumstances, on average 69% of adults across the world's seven largest economies think businesses should focus the same amount (32%) or more (37%) on tackling climate change rather than economic challenges. The research involved 14,468 people in the USA, UK, China, Japan, Germany, France, and India. It also found that nearly half in the world's seven largest economies place \"a great deal\" of responsibility on multinational businesses and governments to make changes to address climate change. Full results can be found in the notes to editors below. Poul Weihrauch, Mars CEO said: \"2050 can seem to be in the distant future, but the progress we make in the next seven years is critical. My generation of CEOs has the ability and responsibility to deliver actual emission reductions and put business on a clear path to Net Zero by 2050. That's why Mars is committed to delivering a 50% reduction in GHG by 2030. We cannot wait for the economy to improve; we must push forward with investments that protect our business today and in the future. As I have said before, profit and purpose are not enemies. Investment in climate is not a trade-off between planet and productivity, or between environment and employment. Consumers and our Associates clearly want both \u2013 and so do we. Investing in emissions reductions is sound business policy, it is achievable, affordable, and it is absolutely necessary.\" Poul Weihrauch continued, \"Companies must be judged \u2013 Mars included \u2013 on the actual results we deliver against our climate plans, not just the scale of the commitment we make \u2013 just as we are judged by our boards and investors on the delivery of financial results, not the quality of our financial forecasts.\" Barry Parkin, Mars Chief Sustainability and Procurement Officer, said: \"Mars has always followed the science, and the science says we must cut our emissions across our full value chain by 50% by 2030. Science points us to five fundamentals that Net Zero roadmaps should consider to deliver real impact, for example that there is no place for exclusions or exceptions and that we must prioritize performance over promises. In preparing our roadmap, we've learned that this is both entirely possible to deliver with existing science and technology as well as entirely affordable. We can both grow our business and cut emissions. I hope our roadmap clearly and powerfully demonstrates what Mars is doing and, critically, what we believe needs to happen at scale to help tackle the worst impacts of climate change.\" With an emissions footprint of a country the size of Finland, Mars aims by 2030 to reduce its emissions by 50% in absolute terms, or approximately 15 million metric tons, building on the 8% GHG reduction to date. The Mars Net Zero Roadmap includes details about how we believe Net Zero is achievable for Mars and serves as an open-source strategy companies across sectors can use to implement meaningful Net Zero action immediately. This means including all emissions, prioritizing performance over promises, advancing progress with real milestones, making decisions today that reverberate tomorrow, and covering what can't be cut with high-quality carbon credits. To achieve Net Zero, Mars will accelerate its focus on: Transitioning to 100% renewable energy \u2013 by changing how it powers its factories, offices and veterinary hospitals, addressing energy used by farmers, how it sources ingredients, and even the energy used by customers (retailers) and by consumers and pet owners at home. \u2013 by changing how it powers its factories, offices and veterinary hospitals, addressing energy used by farmers, how it sources ingredients, and even the energy used by customers (retailers) and by consumers and pet owners at home.

It will be a \u201cmultifaceted\u201d hub for \u201ccross-sector collaboration.\u201d Innovation is all around, and it is one of the key words of the debate on climate warming. Decision-makers, journalists, and businesspeople laud innovation to leverage the advent of sustainable development. Innovation and Technology Between the publication of the Brundtland report in 1987, laying the foundations of sustainability (not compromising the needs of the future generations), and the public debate triggered by Al Gore (An Inconvenient Truth) at the turn of the century, industrial ecology emerged. Engineers wanted to bring a pragmatic response to identified environmental issues, from pollution to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). In the perception of public opinion, the solutions were within reach. This belief that inventions, namely technological revolutions, will compensate for the damage done remains still. Innovation could be the daughter of progress, a Western concept implying that tomorrow will be better than today. Over time, technological progress \u2013 and innovations \u2013 could, for instance, reduce energy consumption. The radical transformation of cars into viable and feasible fuel-efficient vehicles in the last four decades is the best illustration. In the National Determined Contribution (NDC), most of the countries identify technological innovation as a key enabler of the green transition. The UAE has gone further with innovation as a driver of its development \u2013 an ambitious vision that combines technology with innovation. The authorities have emphasized that they are keen to partner with other stakeholders to share best practices, technologies, and innovations. The two best examples are cloud seeding and agriculture. In 2018, at the COP26 in Glasgow, USD 4 billion of investments were announced in innovative techniques such as cloud seeding. Innovation in agritech drove the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a multi-country commitment to increasing innovation in the agricultural sector. In a nutshell, the UAE has accumulated a portfolio of \u201cclean tech innovations.\u201d Despite the goodwill of governments and stakeholders, relying solely on technologies, including new ones in the form of innovation, cannot fix the main environmental issues. As far as the scientific domain is concerned, innovation consists mostly of the elaboration of an existing product. Nevertheless, in economy, it extends to new processes, organizations, and markets. Innovation, a Business Cluster The private sector faces a dilemma. It needs permanent expansion to generate profits. However, this process has globally been based on exploiting fossil fuels since the second industrialization in the 20th century, and on the perceived unlimited or boundless availability of raw materials generating a culture of overconsumption. Unlimited growth associated with overconsumption has led to global warming and the sixth mass extinction (or Holocene extinction). To overcome the contradiction between exploitation and conservation, companies have used innovation in their discourse and practices. Yet, what does it mean in reality? In the banking sector, for instance, banks need to innovate by launching new products to remain competitive in the market. A pioneer bank, like any company, always wants to be ahead of its competitors. Now, with sustainability, it means that it should not compromise the wellbeing of future generations. Edward Freedman, in 1984, was the first to formulate the concept of stakeholders, a third-party which would be affected or would affect the banks because of their decisions. All stakeholders working against climate warming should, therefore, be heard. Contrary to this contemporary understanding and global commercial movement, in July 2022, Stuart Kirk, global head of responsible investment at HSBC gave a presentation at a conference on why investors should not worry about the climate risk. While the employee consequently resigned from HSBC, the affair generated an international outcry. Stuart Kirk ultimately paid for honestly expressing what his peers in his sector think. His argument was that despite the first tangible evidence of global warming with floods and wildfires, the most dramatic effects will be recorded in 20-30 years. From a risk-analysis point of view, the finance person might be right, there is no need to worry or to change now. We\u2019ll see in 20 years. The current fear that coastal cities like Miami \u2013 or Dubai \u2013 are under serious threat of rising sea levels has generated innovative approaches to brace for this kind of imminent impact. Recent research on climate change, as well as the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have been summarily dismissed by political and commercial bodies whose investments collide with global sustainability efforts. This trend somewhat echoes the post-1973 oil-shock discourse. In the West, politicians are reassuring: scientists will find a substitute for oil, and everything will be fine. Embracing back then the same notion of \u201cwe\u2019ll see in 20 years.\u201d Yet, half a century after 1973, there is still no efficient substitute for oil and gas. The Rio Earth Summit highlighted it in 1992, and the scientific community since then confirmed the degradation of the environment without short-term solutions. No new technologies, no invention will turn the tide; they will at best mitigate the effects of Global warming. Sometimes, we may also wonder if rhetorical stances on innovation and sustainability are not a way to downplay the business community\u2019s responsibility in environmental degradation. Innovation is first and foremost understood as a tool to improve performance. The objective is not sustainable development along the SDG guidelines per se, but to keep on generating profits and\/or to maintain market shares, rather thanmitigation of global warming; in one word, competitiveness, for instance, with the photovoltaic systems. Is Innovation Desirable for the Environment? For the business sector, in the (post-)industrialized world, innovation is conceived as the basis for a competitive economy. New products, organizations, and new companies (startups) maintain the spirit of innovation. It even becomes a driver in a sustainable economy, a new economic field with immense financial potential. The green transition is estimated at 2 to 4% of the global GDP, in the same range as military expenditures and, therefore, an attractive field for investors. Here too, the UAE have been seen as a proactive innovation supporter but in cleantech innovation and nature-based solutions. Indeed, innovation, an avatar of the progress ideology, should prevail as long as it\u2019s morally acceptable, for instance, if extraction of rare earth elements causes no pollution in developing countries or in the maritime domain. That said, long-term consequences of innovations could be detrimental to the environment and public health. Commercial agriculture with the spread of mechanization, the use of pesticides, and agricultural inputs sometimes affect public health either directly through ingestion or indirectly by polluting water sources. Glyphosate (Roundup) has been put under the spotlight because of its potential damage to public health. Other mainstays of modern conveniences are endocrine disruptors, perfluoro alkylated substances (PFAS)\u2026etc. Yet, these chemical innovations have not only become essential for modern lifestyles, but also generate economic growth, maintain market shares and profits. Harmful as they may be, these innovations are representative of the essential building blocks of the economic viability of modern states and economies. Without them, businesses cannot compete either locally or globally. Since the 1950s, the moral and ethical responsibilities of business towards society have been discussed. After corporate social responsibility, corporate sustainability shows that there is a responsibility towards society. In the European Union, for instance \u2013 a very pro-business regional organization \u2013 companies are held responsible for their impact on society, meaning on people\u2019s lives and the environment. From a consumer\u2019s point of view, innovation has magic virtues. It sustains the belief that the rich, be they the wealthy populations of the industrialized countries or the upper classes of the developing countries, will maintain their lifestyle without moving out of their comfort zone. Billions of dollars are at stake. For instance, should car makers stop the production of combustion engines? Instilling the idea that electric cars could replace them would possibly be a business opportunity, but also an illusion. It might maintain economic activity but with no environmental gains. As the green motor industry relies more on lithium for car batteries, the fact that there are not enough resources in the world to expect such a universal change, and not without harming environments and communities, has been downplayed considerably to support the surge in production. Depletion of rare earths, as well as pollution in the extraction sites, are significant side effects of the green movement in the car industry. Therefore, reducing the use of individual cars should be the key objective -- all cars. The same could be said regarding tourism. With a high impact on carbon emissions (7 % of the total), aviation should reduce its activity. Downgrading mobility \u2013 giving preference to public transport (train\/metro\/buses) over individual cars, except for carpooling \u2013 is the fastest way to reduce carbon emissions. There is no need for innovation to implement such policies; indeed, the only change, or innovation, required is a lifestyle change, far less costly to the individual yet far less profitable for many markets. Reducing meat consumption is another matter of lifestyle and profits: reduction would also have an impact on carbon emissions, yet no innovation could reduce the carbon footprint of commercial agriculture. However, policies which crack down on overconsumption are not likely to be popular in corporate sectors and, arguably, in political circles. In fact, such requirements in lifestyle change may equally not be popular amongst the various levels of all society and may antagonize the public against the policymakers. Changing our habits implies changing the system. While innovation is a worthwhile means of combating climate change and global warming, it has serious limits and consequences. Lifestyle change may not be a popular direction in pursuing the same end, but it is worth the attention. ","filter_flag":1}

Soil Association head of farming policy Gareth Morgan commented: \u201cIt is shocking that the government\u2019s Net Zero Strategy makes only a passing mention of the impact of fossil fuel-based fertilisers on the climate and environment and even more alarming that they have no plan in place to support farmers to reduce their reliance on them.\u201d A new campaign is urging the public to sign the \u2018There\u2019s no Net Zero without fixing fertiliser\u2019 petition, calling for the government to put an immediate plan in place to cut fossil-fuel-based nitrogen fertilisers. The Soil Association said it was working with farming and environmental NGOs to establish an action group on nitrogen to press the government. Not only is nitrogen a key contributor to climate change when released as nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more potent at warming the atmosphere than CO2, farmers\u2019 reliance on \u201cexpensive and polluting\u201d fossil fuels also makes them vulnerable to major price spikes and events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Morgan said. \u201cAgriculture and the food system are responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions and failing to address this will mean that the government has simply no prospect of meeting its net zero target,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt is vital that the government demonstrates its commitment to net zero by setting a target for reducing fossil fuel-based fertiliser in UK farming and offers incentives and advice to support farmers to reduce their dependence on nitrogen fertiliser and adopt cheaper, more nature friendly approaches to fix nitrogen on their farms.\u201d He said the experience of organic farmers could be used to steer the industry toward more nature-friendly farming practices. \u201cOrganic farmers build natural fertility using nature friendly farming practices incorporating natural fertiliser, crops including legumes and clover in rotations, and a whole farm system approach,\u201d Morgan explained. \u201cThis experience can help conventional farmers to reduce their reliance on costly inputs which will deliver significant benefits for the climate and biodiversity.\u201d Critical role In defence of the role played by mineral fertilisers in agriculture, Jo Gilbertson, head of fertiliser at the Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC), expressed some doubt over the large-scale shift to organic farming and stressed the efforts the sector was making toward decarbonisation. \u201cMineral fertilisers play a critical role in food production as part of a range of necessary inputs, with these products supporting sustainable, resilient farm businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe evidence clearly shows that a large-scale shift to organic farming practices would mean increased atmospheric and water pollution caused by expanding cropping areas by as much as 200 per cent to produce the same amount of food. This would also result in higher food costs and detrimentally impact the UK\u2019s food security. \u201cThe fertiliser sector is continually innovating to decarbonise manufacturing processes. New products, such as green ammonia-based nitrogen fertilisers and other low carbon footprint minerals, are in development and farmers are being encouraged to look at their nutrient use efficiency.\u201d Organic September A survey by Soil Association Certification to coincide with Organic September found that 69 per cent of UK citizens are worried by recent evidence of climate change, but just a third are aware of fossil fuel-based fertilisers\u2019 contribution to warming, air pollution, dying rivers and poor soil health. According to the survey, two-thirds think agriculture should be a higher priority for all political parties, while three-quarters believe farmers need more support in producing food in harmony with nature. \u201cOur over-reliance on artificial fertilisers is contributing to air pollution, dying rivers, depleted soils and the rapidly warming climate,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cEmissions from fossil fuel-based nitrogen fertilisers are contributing to the climate emergency. This fossil fuel-reliant system has been a quick fix for producing more food but has come at a huge cost to nature, climate and human health. \u201cOrganic standards ban the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. Modelling, by French think tank IDDRI, suggests that if the whole of Europe switched to an organic or agroecological food and farming system combined with key dietary changes, we could see a 40 per cent drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Half of this drop would result from a cut in the use of fossil fuel-derived nitrogen fertiliser.\u201d The message of this year\u2019s Organic September campaign is \u2018Organic is climate action\u2019. According to Soil Association, the campaign will urge the public to support organic by \u201cmaking one small swap to organic\u201d on their next visit to the shops.","filter_flag":1}

How is the public sector adapting to green requirements? There are highly ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors. Law and policy often mandate that the public sector shows leadership by making swifter progress, particularly through decarbonisation of its building and transport stock. For example, in negotiations to finalise a Recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, MEPs want to see all new buildings occupied, operated or owned by the public sector being zero-emission by 2026 (as opposed to 2028 for other buildings). This will require Governments to act as pioneers in this respect. To achieve the transformation required, awarding authorities will need to embed greenhouse gas emission reduction at every stage of the public procurement processes. The 2020 Programme for Government committed to implementing green public procurement (\u201cGPP\u201d) in all tenders using public funds by 2023 and the Climate Action Plan 2023 commits to updating the EPA\u2019s GPP Guidance for the Public Sector in Q3 2023. GPP means \u201ca process whereby public \/ semi-public authorities meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities by choosing solutions that have a reduced impact on the environment throughout their life-cycle, as compared to alternative products\/solutions.\u201d1 Effectively an authority will be required to look at the bigger picture in terms of the product \/ service \/ works they are purchasing and consider its impact on the environment for the entire project life cycle, starting with sourcing and supply chain, production and manufacturing processes, and site working practices, through to the sustainability of distribution, operation, use, recycling and final disposal. There is sometimes a perception that public procurement legislation stymies innovative approaches to embedding environmental considerations in public competitions. On the contrary, however, Directive 2014\/24\/EU on public procurement supports green purchasing, as shown in the examples in table 1. On a practical level, what are some examples of what awarding authorities can do? Market Engagement The contracting authority should explore the potential of innovative solutions through appropriate pre-market engagement and consider what is required from the outset. If the product \/ service \/ works is in existence on the market, specific green criteria should be considered in the tender documents. Otherwise, engagement gives an opportunity to encourage innovation and collaboration. This is also an opportunity to hear about regulatory hurdles to sustainable solutions (for example in planning and building control), and for the awarding authority to feed this back, as appropriate, to the relevant Department. Selection Criteria Contracting authorities can assess bidders on their previous experience and capacity to deliver GPP aspects of a contract. Some examples are set out below. \u2013 Human and technical resources: Does the bidder have the capacity to deliver what the contracting authority requires? \u2013 Previous experience \/ references: Can the bidder demonstrate previous experience in respect of the current requirement, including experience relating to GPP? \u2013 Professional qualification \/ certificates: Can the bidder adequately evidence that they are proficient or skilled in delivering the requirement in a sustainable manner, in accordance with certain qualifications? \u2013 Environmental management system: Does the bidder have in place environmental management systems, which assist in identifying, managing and controlling their activities that impact on the environmental? \u2013 Supply chain management: Can the bidder adequately show where supply chains are sourcing materials, and that it is being done in a sustainable and ethical fashion? How is this being monitored and reported on? Award Criteria Award criteria can harness the potential of a well-developed technical specification to support energy efficiency, extended warranty periods, circularity and full life cycle costing. At the heart of public procurement, we will still need to respect the core principles. Therefore, even with the application of GPP criteria in tender documents, this must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner, and be related and proportionate to the subject-matter of the contract. Contract Last but not least, the form of contract needs to be considered at the outset. Contracts will increasingly include obligations to report on emissions, and other green performance criteria. Once that becomes a requirement, the question arises around the further mechanisms that will help drive green processes and outcomes: for example, the inclusion of carbon budgets, incentives to improve on performance as the contract is delivered, and mechanisms (such as remediation plans) to get the parties back on track if performance becomes sub-optimal from a green perspective. Talk of green clauses bring us on to collaborative contracting. While this is gaining more traction in private sector contracts, and posing some challenges in public sector contracts, it is possible to utilise this to develop innovative solutions as projects progress. The key is to frame clear and transparent contract mechanisms from the start. In this context it is worth bearing in mind the role of the public sector in delivering the Climate Act Plan 2023, described as follows: We will lead by example, embedding climate action as a central value across all public sector organisations, relentlessly focussing on continuous improvements that deliver real progress. Keeping an eye on the budget We are now halfway through the term of our first five-year carbon budget. By the end of the second carbon budget in 2030, the public sector is required to have cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 51% compared to 2018 levels and to have improved its energy efficiency by 50%. This is to be done by specific actions to decarbonise its buildings, transport, waste and energy usage, required to be set out in an annually updated Climate Action Plan. While the concept of GPP is not new, the EPA reported that only 24% of the total number of procurement contracts over \u20ac25,000 which were signed in 2021 incorporated GPP \u2013 this was down from 26% in 2020. While GPP has been a voluntary structure, the legislation requiring action to reduce emissions is not. Driving down emissions through the effective and focused use of procurement processes is here to stay.

Scientists also combine the newly gained understanding of biological processes and the latest technologies to create groundbreaking innovations for a bio-based economy. However, the transition to a bioeconomy means a profound change for society. Therefore, the new national bioeconomy strategy also includes social, political and economic research. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany defines the bioeconomy as the production, exploitation and use of biological resources, processes and systems to provide products, processes and services across all economic sectors within the framework of a future-oriented economy. The bioeconomy harbours the potential to provide sustainable solutions in order to protect resources and ensure our prosperity. Joining forces for the bioeconomy In its national bioeconomy strategy, the Federal Government lays down the guidelines and objectives for its policy on the bioeconomy and lists measures for their implementation. The strategy builds on the 'National Research Strategy Bioeconomy 2030' [Nationale Forschungsstrategie Bio\u00d6konomie 2030] and the 'National Policy Strategy Bioeconomy' [Nationale Politikstrategie Bio\u00f6konomie] to weave the various political strands together within a single coherent framework. The new strategy is designed to substantially support sustainable development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide an important framework. By 2030, these will demand sufficient food, health and well-being, affordable and clean energy, decent work, economic growth, responsible consumption and production and climate action, inter alia. All of these goals are addressed in the new bioeconomy strategy. Guidelines of the new bioeconomy strategy The new bioeconomy strategy provides the conditions to develop the full potential of the bioeconomy for Germany to strengthen its role as a bioeconomy leader and to create the technology and jobs of tomorrow. Two overarching guidelines support the objectives and actions set out in the national bioeconomy strategy. The first guideline highlights how biological knowledge and advanced technology are the pillars of a future-oriented, sustainable and climate-neutral economy. Novel, bio-based production systems can, for example, supply tailored ingredients for industry. Optimised microorganisms or individual components such as enzymes deliver new raw materials or products. To this end, science aims at better understanding how biological systems work and interact with one another \u2013 from the fundamental molecular principles to the complex interplay in ecosystems. Bioeconomy research is designed to translate this knowledge into real-life applications. Bioeconomy is integrative and combines interdisciplinary research and systemic solutions. Findings in life sciences are converging with other branches of science and technologies. The second guideline relates to the raw materials used by industry and the need for a sustainable economy based on biogenic resources. The focus is on biomass as a renewable raw material. It can consist of plants, microorganisms, algae or fungi, for example. Today, the focus is also increasingly on bio-based residues and waste materials. Sustainable production and an efficient, cycle-oriented use of biogenic raw materials are essential. It is also important to preserve the fertility of the soil and biodiversity, and not to pollute the environment, including the water. Biogenic resources can replace much more than just fossil raw materials. With their help, completely new products are created, such as nutritional supplements for improved baby food, new composite materials for building houses or car bodies, or optimized crops that are robust and productive. The Federal Government's strategy on the bioeconomy addresses a broad spectrum of objectives at different levels of society and across all economic sectors. It can be summarised in six common strategic goals: 1) Develop bioeconomy solutions for the sustainability agenda 2) Recognise and harness the potential of the bioeconomy within ecological boundaries 3) Enhance and apply biological knowledge 4) Provide a sustainable raw material base for industry 5) Promote Germany as the leading location for innovation in the bioeconomy 6) Involve society in the bioeconomy and intensify national and international collaboration","filter_flag":1}

The bourse operator released a sparkling set of earnings for its fiscal 2023 (FY2023) ending 30 June 2023. Revenue was up 8.5% year on year to S$687.9 million while net profit jumped 26.5% year on year to S$570.9 million. The blue-chip group also raised its quarterly dividend to S$0.085 from S$0.08 previously. In line with the strong results, shares of SGX have also hit a 52-week high of S$9.98 recently. The bourse operator recently unveiled a new corporate structure to spearhead further growth. Can investors feel confident that the group will continue to see rising profits and dividends? A new corporate structure Just last week, SGX announced a new corporate structure to accentuate the strengths of its multi-asset offering. The new structure will also cater to continued growth across its products and platforms. Michael Syn, who has been head of equities since July 2019, will be appointed as SGX\u2019s President and the head of the Global Markets division. All SGX\u2019s asset classes, including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities except for indices, will be under his purview. Lee Beng Hong will be the head of Wholesale Markets & Platforms that oversees foreign exchange (FX) technology and workflow solutions. These two positions ensure that SGX can continue to broaden its multi-asset offerings and expand its geographic reach. The Indices division will be taken care of by Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ng Yao Loong who will also help to focus on partnerships to increase SGX\u2019s offerings. These changes will take place from 1 October. Launching new products Even before this corporate re-jig, SGX was already releasing a slew of new products into the market to broaden its offerings. These new products not only offer investors and fund managers greater choice but also help to cement SGX\u2019s standing as an Asian multi-asset hub. Back in May, SGX launched Singapore Depository Receipts (DR) under a DR linkage with the Stock Exchange of Thailand. In August, Structured Certificates (SC) were launched and made available for trading from 30 August. SC are third-party-issued financial instruments that offer investors yield enhancements and better payoffs if certain conditions are met. This launch was the first in Asia and greatly helped the group to meet the diverse needs of different investor profiles. On the Indices front, the bourse operator has also been very active. Back in June, SGX welcomed the listing of CSOP iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index ETF. This ETF offers investors access to the digital technology sectors in India and Southeast Asia. August saw the introduction of the CGS Fullgoal Vietnam 30 Sector Cap Index ETF. Starting with S$35 million in assets under management (AUM), this ETF offers investors access to the fast-growing Vietnam market. And just this month, SGX partnered with BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) to list the iShares MSCI Asia ex-Japan Climate Action ETF. This is the largest equity ETF launched in Singapore with a starting AUM of US$426 million. Growing its commodities and forex pillars Apart from introducing new products and beefing up its Indices division, investors should not forget that SGX is also scaling up its commodities and FX divisions. For FY2023, SGX recorded a 35% year on year jump in daily average volume (DAV) to 160,000 for its Commodities division. Of note, iron ore DAV hit a record high of 140,000 in FY2023, up from just 99,000 a year ago. The group also expanded its client base for commodities by including more financial clients. Over at its FX division, currency futures enjoyed a 28.7% year-on-year growth in volumes with SGX\u2019s CNH and INR contracts among the top 10 traded listed FX futures globally. SGX\u2019s over-the-counter (OTC) FX franchise recorded an average daily volume of US$75.8 billion for FY2023 and is on track to exceed US$100 billion by FY2025 or earlier. Get Smart: A potential further increase in dividends SGX has proven its ability to not only increase its breadth of offerings but has also forged partnerships to further increase its slate of products. It is an encouraging development and coupled with the recent reorganisation, promises to help spearhead more growth for the bourse operator. SGX has also communicated its intention to increase its dividend per share by mid-single-digit percentage compound annual growth rate subject to earnings growth. Investors can look forward to not just higher profits but also potentially larger dividends in the years to come. The best gift a responsible parent can give their child is a secure, comfortable financial future. And we found that dividend investing is one of the easiest and effortless methods to do it.

A new report by Strategic Perspectives compares the performance and provides a snapshot of the global race to the top in five major economies \u2013 China, European Union, United States. Strategic Perspectives is a European think tank that works in a collaborative way to ensure effective climate action is the solution to a multitude of crises the world is facing. The report compares the 5 major economies and shows that: A global race to the top on zero-carbon technologies is well underway China and India shows significant potential to grow its importance in the global supply chain. The EU and the US competing for leadership. All countries are seeking to position themselves in this new industrial era, with its associated socio-economic benefits. Manufacturing and investing in renewable energy, battery electric vehicles and heatpumps provide a competitive advantage for the countries at the forefront of the technology race. Japan is not yet fully, maximising its potential due to weak policies. The report shows how national transition plans such as the European Green Deal, China\u2019s 14th Five-Year Plan, India\u2019s Energy Conservation Act, Japan\u2019s Green Growth Strategy and, more recently, the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are being transformed into industrial growth engines. The analysis is based on existing data presented with the support of the international research group Zero Carbon Analytics. Key findings on the five economies: \u25cf China clearly leads in most areas we analysed. It shows the biggest advances in manufacturing of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines (narcelle) and lithium-cells for batteries, as well as jobs and investments. The country aims to capture a large part of the growing net-zero market as well as control of technology and component supply chains for the rest of the world. \u25cf The EU is decarbonising its economy fast, with the largest share of wind and solar electricity generation accounting for 22% of the electricity mix in 2022. The EU is also leading on heat pump investment and deployment. It is the strongest competitor to China on green jobs, sales of battery electric vehicles, wind manufacturing and on investments (NB. The data precedes the Inflation Reduction Act). \u25cf The United States performs strongest on innovation through investment in research, development and demonstration (RD&D). It is in a neck and neck race with China on absolute spending and with Japan if measured per capita. The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to challenge Chinese leadership and could allow the US to surpass the EU on investments, jobs and renewable energy share in electricity; it currently ranks second ahead of China. \u25cf Japan is a strong competitor on innovation if RD&D is assessed on a per capita basis. Taking battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hybrid cars together, Japan had the biggest fleet of these vehicles in 2021. Japan could be much more competitive if it was to fully commit to the energy transition with a coal phase-out and put stronger incentives in place on heat pump deployment for heating and cooling. \u25cf India is an emerging economy with ambitions to position itself in the global net-zero supply chain. It still faces a different set of challenges but these could be overcome faster if it received more financial support. India is making progress in incorporating solar and wind into its electricity generation, almost doubling its share from 2017 figures (5% to 9%). With additional investment, India could become a showcase of successful net-zero development in other sectors. The electric vehicle industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 49% between 2022 and 2030. \u201cA new industrial era based on zero-carbon technologies has emerged. China, the EU and the US are competing to seize the biggest shares in the growing global markets and secure supplies for their domestic demand. In a world where you lead or risk being left behind, manufacturing zero-carbon technologies turns into a precondition for industrial growth, innovation and competitiveness\u201d, emphasised Linda Kalcher, Executive Director of Strategic Perspectives. \u201cThe net-zero industrial race between major economies is on. China\u2019s industrial leadership has proven successful in driving growth and job creation, prompting the US to launch the IRA. Countries that miss the train on the net-zero transition will likely lag behind in industrial development, remaining heavily dependent on costly gas, oil and coal\u201d, said Neil Makaroff, Director of Strategic Perspectives. \u201cWhile Europe is rapidly deploying renewables, heat pumps and electric vehicles, it cannot rest on its laurels. To maintain its position in the global race to net-zero, it is time to turn the European Green Deal into a major reindustrialisation plan. Building factories for solar panels, batteries and heat pumps will not only secure Europe\u2019s net-zero transition, it will also create quality jobs\u201d, highlighted Neil Makaroff, Director of Strategic Perspectives.

This agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the HanesBrands Board of Directors, is the successful conclusion of the Company\u2019s previously announced evaluation of a range of strategic options for the global Champion business. HanesBrands has made significant progress in recent years to reignite its innerwear business, increase market share, attract younger consumers, and strengthen its operating model. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company intends to focus on extending its leadership position in the innerwear category and generating above-market growth through continued consumer-centric product innovation and increased investment across its portfolio of leading brands, including Hanes, Bonds, Maidenform, and Bali. Bill Simon, Chairman of the Board said, \u201cFollowing a thorough review of options for the global Champion business with the support of our financial and legal advisors, we are pleased to have reached this agreement with Authentic Brands Group that we believe maximizes value for Champion and best positions HanesBrands for long-term success. Importantly, we believe this transaction will enable the Company to accelerate its debt reduction while positioning HanesBrands to deliver consistent growth and cash flow generation through a focused strategy on advancing its leading innerwear brands and optimizing its world-class supply chain.\u201d Steve Bratspies, CEO stated, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of significant effort by our teams to position all of our brands on the optimal path for the future. Over the past three years, we have taken necessary actions to enhance the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance \u2013 returning to historical gross margins, reducing our cost structure, lowering our debt levels, and generating consistent cash flow. The successful completion of this transaction further simplifies our business, deleverages our balance sheet, and enhances the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance. As we begin the next chapter for HanesBrands, we believe we\u2019re in an even stronger position to further extend our leadership in innerwear, pursue new cost reduction opportunities as we ensure we have the right operating structure in place, and advance our multi-year flywheel to drive strong shareholder returns.\u201d The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024. Subsequent to the closing, HanesBrands will provide certain transition services for Champion, including operating the business in select regions through a transition period. HanesBrands expects net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $900 million, including working capital adjustments and other customary transaction costs and excluding the contingent cash consideration. In line with HanesBrands\u2019 commitment to debt reduction, the Company will utilize all net proceeds from the transaction to accelerate its reduction of debt and expects meaningful deleveraging on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. On a trailing 12-month basis as of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the global Champion business generated approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is net of approximately $60 million of stranded costs. The Company has specific plans to remove all stranded costs within a year of the transaction closing as it completes the transition of the business. The Company intends to classify Champion as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024 and as a result, expects to update its full-year 2024 guidance in conjunction with the release of its second-quarter earnings results. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Evercore are serving as financial advisors to HanesBrands, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Jones Day are serving as their legal advisors.","filter_flag":1}
