The target for all EU members is to achieve a 10% landfill rate by 2035. \u201cWaste-to-energy is an alternative to landfill and a final sink for waste that is not recyclable or reusable, thus fulfilling a hygienic task,\u201d explains Johnny Stuen. \u201cLandfills are dangerous places, whereas waste-to-energy in the EU is strictly regulated.\u201d Hazardous waste that needs immediate safe treatment as well as waste that cannot be recycled because of contamination or composition may find its way into a waste-to-energy plant. \u201cSome countries depend heavily on landfills and it should not be the first thing. But our goal is to get better at sorting, drive up the recycling rates and put everything that cannot be recycled in sanitary landfill. Of course, we aim to minimise landfill but it is preferable to incineration,\u201d argues Janek V\u00e4hk. One point on which both sides agree is that no recyclable waste should end up in an incinerator. The problem: too many recyclables end up in the residual waste and too much recyclable waste is not recycled as yet. \u201cI strongly advocate efficient source separation. This is essential for quality recycling. When we have to deal with mixed waste it\u2019s already too late,\u201d says Ella Stengler. Stuen agrees: \u201cWaste-to-energy is not the solution by itself. Good sorting systems are essential. And we need a lot more sorting technology so no recyclable waste ends up in an incinerator.\u201d A harmonised collection system might be helpful, according to Janek V\u00e4hk, \u201cbecause it is very confusing what to put in what bin.\u201d \u201cWaste-to-energy plants don\u2019t have an influence on what they get to burn. Therefore, legislation is needed. They cannot reduce the waste by themselves,\u201d says CEWEP\u2019s Ella Stengler. But of course, just because selective collection is compulsory in the EU, this doesn\u2019t mean that it is homogeneous throughout its territory. A concern expressed by the EU and NGOs alike is related to the design of the plants. Driving up recycling rates \u2013 and in the best case scenario, recycling innovation especially for plastics \u2013 will result in a smaller amount of residual waste and therefore less material that may end up in an incinerator. \u201cShould we significantly reduce waste generation, the waste-to-energy plants are flexible and can reduce their volume. But I wouldn\u2019t shut them down just yet,\u201d says Ella Stengler, also pointing to the change in waste that will be delivered to waste-to-energy plants in the future. \u201cWe will have less fossils in waste-to-energy thanks to better source separation. So more biogenic input and less fossil fuels will really make an impact.\u201d Another aspect Stengler stresses is independent heat production: \u201cEurope is highly dependent on fossil fuels. Waste-to-energy can supply energy and so on a local level replace other energy sources and thus make us a little less dependent on other countries.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The concept of a circular economy is gaining increasing traction as a means to address the challenges of resource scarcity and environmental sustainability. In a linear economy, products are manufactured, used, and discarded, leading to significant waste generation and the depletion of finite resources. However, in a circular economy, the focus is on designing products with longevity in mind and promoting practices that maximize resource use while minimizing waste. A range of examples illustrates this approach, from upcycled fashion and closed-loop textile recycling to remanufacturing and the sharing economy. Circular Economy Examples Upcycled Fashion Upcycled fashion is a sustainable trend in the apparel industry that takes discarded clothing and textiles and transforms them into new, fashionable pieces. This approach not only reduces textile waste but also promotes creativity and craftsmanship. For instance, companies like Patagonia repair and resell used outdoor gear, extending the lifespan of their products and reducing textile waste. Closed-Loop Textile Recycling Eileen Fisher\u2019s \u201cTake Back\u201d program showcases a closed-loop system in fashion. It involves collecting old garments from customers, disassembling them, and using the materials to create new clothing. This initiative not only reduces the fashion industry\u2019s environmental footprint but also highlights the potential for circularity in the world of apparel. Electronic Waste Recycling Many electronics manufacturers, including Apple, now offer trade-in programs for old devices. These programs encourage customers to return their old gadgets, which are then refurbished and resold. The company Fairphone, creates products that are meant to extend the lifespan of electronic products and reusing their components, electronic waste is significantly reduced. Reusable Packaging Businesses, such as TerraCycle, Loop, RePack, offer reusable packaging systems where customers receive products in containers that are returned, cleaned, and reused, reducing single-use packaging waste. Refill + Reuse Products For years, cleaning product bottles were designed for single use and then disposal. Companies like Method have since introduced a new chapter, starring sleek aluminum bottles paired with concentrated refill pouches. The innovative system saves over 96% of the plastic compared to Method\u2019s traditional single-use plastic bottles each time the aluminum bottle is refilled with all-purpose cleaner or foaming hand wash. The bottles are crafted from infinitely recyclable aluminum while the pouches use 60% less plastic than a typical jug. Together, the bottle and refill offer an endlessly reusable solution that keeps plastic waste out of oceans and landfills. Plaine Products is another company in this space. They designed a sustainable packaging initiative that encourages customers to participate in a packaging revolution. Customers are asked to order products in refillable bottles, replacing the lid with a pump. When low on the product, they can order a refill or subscribe for scheduled deliveries. Empty bottles can be rinsed and returned in a provided box with a prepaid return label. The goal is to reduce waste and conserve resources through reuse. Food Waste Reduction Apps like Too Good To Go tackle the issue of food waste by connecting consumers with surplus food from restaurants and grocery stores. Users can purchase these items at a reduced price, diverting edible food from landfills. This not only reduces food waste but also saves consumers money and supports sustainability in the food industry. Biomaterials and 3D Printing A growing trend in the circular economy is the use of biodegradable materials in 3D printing. For instance, mycelium-based packaging and products are becoming popular alternatives to traditional plastics. These biomaterials are sustainable and can be easily composted at the end of their useful life, reducing plastic waste. Rental and Sharing Economy Sharing of products through websites like FriendWithA, enable individuals to share resources and reduce the need for new products. Car-sharing services like Zipcar and Turo promote shared vehicle usage, reducing the number of cars on the road and the resources required for manufacturing and maintenance. Shared commercial kitchens like Kitchen United rent out fully equipped cooking spaces to food businesses. These examples illustrate various approaches to creating a circular economy, where products and resources are used efficiently, waste is minimized, and environmental impact is reduced. The circular economy is a key strategy in addressing sustainability challenges and conserving resources for future generations.","filter_flag":1}

The products are generally durable, can be repaired and refurbished, and have a customer base that cares about preserving the environment. I\u2019m an avid tent camper and have run through my share of sleeping bags over the years. The newest circular economy innovation in outdoor gear that excites me is a synthetic sleeping bag from Nemo Equipment. The Forte sleeping bag has been a bestseller for some time for Nemo, which has long encouraged users to repair its bags to keep them in use longer. Other brands have dipped their toes into circular economy solutions to varying degrees and with mixed results. One of the first efforts was Patagonia\u2019s \"Don\u2019t Buy This Jacket\" campaign in 2011, which aimed to educate consumers about the environmental impacts of purchasing new products. It was a clever program, but quickly resulted in increased sales of new Patagonia gear. Patagonia has continued its circularity journey and is viewed as a leader in this space. More recently, the likes of Arc\u2019teryx, REI and Cotopaxi have launched into resale with Trove\u2019s recommerce platform. Again, resale is a great step, but we haven\u2019t seen data to show that recommerce for these brands is leading to decreased sales of new products. Circular economy efforts are also showing up prominently in outdoor brands\u2019 sustainability reports. VF Corporation, whose brands include The North Face, Icebreaker and Smartwool, devoted a whole section of its 2022 \"Made for Change\" report to circularity. There it highlights efforts in product design, maximizing product lifecycle, managing for products' end-of-life and developing reverse supply chains. In other words, a circular economy for outdoor gear and apparel is no longer a fringe concept. We ask ourselves: Is this product worth the resources it will require to make it? Nemo has designed its newest Forte sleeping bag, released in the spring, for full recyclability at the end of its useful lifetime. While most sleeping bags use five to 10 polymers, the Forte\u2019s designers set out to achieve maximum recyclability through limiting the number of materials, according to Nemo. More than 97 percent of the sleeping bag by weight is from a single material, mostly recycled polyester (rPET). This design, combined with a recycling partnership with Unifi, allows Nemo to keep these bags out of the landfill. The Forte Endless Promise is a great innovation that should excite anyone interested in the circular economy. Nemo is also releasing several more products in the Endless Promise line over the coming years, including down sleeping bags and backpacks, with its sights set on eventually becoming fully circular for all products. Not only has Nemo designed a sleeping bag with recycling in mind, but it has foregone a small pilot to fully apply the new circular model to all Forte synthetic sleeping bags. This all-in mentality, avoiding messy pilot programs, feels like the best way to avoid confusion in the market and frustration for users. I had a chance to chat by email this past week with Theresa McKenney, Nemo\u2019s director of sustainability. Nemo, a New Hampshire-based company founded in 2002, sells its products at retailers such as REI and Cabela\u2019s as well as through direct sales on its website. Nemo is well-regarded for high quality and thoughtful design, so this foray into circularity does not come as a surprise. Jon Smieja: Tell us a bit about why Nemo is taking on this challenge around circularity and the Endless Promise line of products? Theresa McKenney: Eighty-seven percent of Nemo\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions happen before our products leave the factory. Our first design directive is to never bring anything to market that doesn\u2019t offer a meaningfully better experience for the customer. We ask ourselves: Is this product worth the resources it will require to make it? Should this product exist? If we think it should, we then try to make it with the best performing, most sustainable materials possible. To us, circularity is the final piece of the puzzle. The goal of our Endless Promise program is to keep good gear out of the landfill with vetted repair, resale and recycling pathways. Smieja: One product is out, the synthetic Forte Endless Promise sleeping bag. I have one and love it. If you could, I'd love to hear what kinds of challenges you faced in developing that product and how you overcame them? McKenney: The Forte Endless Promise brings a circularity-focused update to our No. 1 selling synthetic sleeping bag line. We didn\u2019t want to approach the problem with a small pilot; we wanted to encourage systemic changes in our product development process. Our first challenge was finding a recycling partner to understand our design parameters. What makes a product recyclable? For our first Endless Promise product, a synthetic sleeping bag, we learned that it could be mechanically recycled if the materials were as mono-polymer as possible. Forte is greater than 97 percent polyester by weight \u2014 mostly rPET [recycled polyester]. We did have some challenges during the design process. Our initial recycling partner needed a 40,000 pound test run; that\u2019s the equivalent of a year\u2019s worth of sleeping bags for us. We went back to the drawing board and connected with Unifi, a recycler based in North Carolina. We passed their recyclability testing and launched our first Endless Promise product. Smieja: Based on conversations we've had in the past, I know you are working with other partners on these projects as well. Can you share some of those partnerships up and down your supply chain making this work possible? McKenney: Unifi was our first recycling partner with the 2023 launch of Forte Endless Promise. In 2024, we\u2019re expanding our Endless Promise collection to two additional categories. Down sleeping bags and backpacks, a completely new product line for us. Both down bags and backpacks required different recycling streams. We needed to extract down as a new process step, and the backpacks were too materially complex for mechanical recycling. We\u2019re partnering with two Los Angeles-based companies to solve these issues: Allied Feather & Down and Ambercycle. We started in the U.S., but we\u2019re expanding repair and recycling options in mainland Europe in 2024. We\u2019ll be announcing those partnerships at ISPO [in Munich] next month. Smieja: I know you follow regulatory action around the globe. Are any of those policies helping drive this work, or do you see the Endless Promise work as a way to get out ahead of them? McKenney: Our Endless Promise line is more reflective of our values as a team than a response to regulatory pressure. That said, there\u2019s a lot of EPR activity happening right now, both in the U.S. and abroad. We\u2019re in support of producer responsibility and are working alongside organizations like California Outdoor Recreation Partnership and Outdoor Industry Association to provide feedback to legislators. Smieja: I'm curious about the product design teams. How were they trained to think about circular economy principles? Were they excited to take on this added challenge? What have you learned about training internal teams? McKenney: Circular design and sustainable design are now integrated into our development process, but it has been something that we\u2019ve been working towards since our early days as a brand. Back in 2008, Cam [Brensinger, founder & CEO of Nemo Equipment] and the design team challenged themselves to build a tent that could be put in your curbside recycling bin at the end of its useful life. While the systems were not available to us at that time, we did launch the Nano OZ backpacking tent made from recycled polyester fabrics, reground polyoxymethylene and recycled ABS hardware, and we even had an option for handmade bamboo poles. For us, a win is when we design a product that delivers the best performance and has the lowest footprint possible. In 2019, as a company, we read Paul Hawken\u2019s book \"Drawdown.\" It was a great step in getting the entire team thinking differently from a personal and work perspective. Our product team led the charge on the Endless Promise project \u2014 once they had guidance on design constraints, they made it happen. It\u2019s been an energizing project for all of us. Nemo's sustainability team will set up trainings on big-picture topics, but much of the value we can bring is sustainability troubleshooting. How do we get the product back to NEMO? What is the network of chemical recyclers in Europe? We can chase down a lot of those questions. Smieja: How are you going about training customers? Retailers? Clearly the biggest benefit of this program will come if the products are returned as anticipated. How do you make sure that happens? McKenney: I think it\u2019s a brand\u2019s responsibility to make circularity easy for consumers and retailers. In the U.S., Nemo offers a $20 incentive to trade in products for recycling. Every Endless Promise product is clearly marked with a QR code inviting folks to learn more about the program. From that menu, you can learn how to repair, resell and recycle the product, based on where you are. As we expand circularity options to more markets, we\u2019ll continue to update the page. Smieja: To some degree I have to imagine your customers self-select as the kind of people that might care about these initiatives. First question is whether that is your experience. Second, any advice for brands thinking about circular economy initiatives that might not have the same motivated customer base? McKenney: Sustainability is becoming increasingly important to customers \u2014 both retailers and consumers. We still see performance as the top priority. For us, a win is when we design a product that delivers the best performance and has the lowest footprint possible. For brands thinking about circular economy initiatives, I\u2019d recommend starting with a product that is not materially complex. The more individual materials or blends that are in a product, the more complex recycling pathways are. Oh, I almost forgot. This is not a product review, but I absolutely love this sleeping bag, whose prices are comparable to others on the market. After using it a few times over the summer at state parks in my home state of Minnesota, I can say it is one of the most comfortable sleeping bags I\u2019ve ever used. For a side sleeper like myself \u2014 because I snore too much on my back \u2014 the Forte bag offers a roomy leg design that allows me to move around freely.","filter_flag":1}

Motivated by the imperative to enhance resource efficiency and mitigate waste\u2019s environmental impact, we examine the CE concept\u2019s extension of product life cycles, while minimizing waste. We conduct a comprehensive review to explore the core CE principles across all stages of the product lifecycle and provide an in-depth analysis of waste treatment practices in Poland, emphasizing potential energy conversion methods like biogas production and incineration. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing waste incineration plant design for quicker payback, aligning with circular rational economic practices. Strategies such as improving biogas production, establishing solid bio-waste fermentation facilities, promoting sortable packaging, and incentivizing sustainable sorting emerge to optimize waste management. These findings highlight the pivotal role of economic, environmental, and energy considerations in shaping sustainable waste management strategies. Introduction The concept of a circular economy (CE) has gained remarkable traction in recent years, presenting a compelling vision of our Earth as a closed-system spaceship where resources efficiently circulate. Within this grand metaphor, our global society, encompassing economic, environmental, social, and cultural facets, plays a pivotal role in maintaining equilibrium. One of the core tenets of CE, as advocated by the EU CE Strategy (EU COM\/2015\/0614), underscores the significance of waste management in achieving optimal environmental outcomes and reintroducing valuable materials into the economy to maintain sustainability. This article meticulously explores the waste management component within this celestial circular system. Despite the prolific discussions surrounding CE, a universally accepted definition remains elusive, with over 200 variations scattered throughout scientific literature (Adamczak, 2022). CE, an evolutionary concept rooted in traditional waste management, holds relevance in both municipal and industrial domains. While scholarly discourse revolves around solid and liquid waste management, focusing on processing technologies, selective collection, and disposal methods, broader CE discussions, including the ambitious goal of achieving zero waste, often originate from the influential work of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Curiously, amid these discussions, a significant research gap exists\u2014the role of urban energy self-sufficiency within the CE framework. This research void has recently gained prominence, partly due to geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which cast a spotlight on concerns surrounding energy supply (Gabon et al., 2023; Apostu et al., 2023). Moreover, rapid economic and population growth over the past half-century has led to the excessive consumption of global resources, surpassing the Earth\u2019s regenerative capacity (Popescu et al., 2022). Urbanization and population expansion have significantly escalated global material consumption, straining both individual and planetary resources. Remarkably, a mere 1% reduction in material and energy consumption across all sectors could generate an economy-boosting value of PLN 19.5 billion, underscoring the urgency of sustainable resource management (Deloitte, 2018). The extraction of raw materials, which has tripled from 1970 to 2017, now stands at a staggering 60 billion tons annually, equivalent to 22 kg per person daily (Fiksel, 2006). In the European Union alone, 2.2 billion tonnes of waste are generated annually, with municipal waste accounting for 27% of this total (Haglung, 2011). Alarmingly, resource extraction is responsible for 50% of human-generated carbon emissions and 90% of biodiversity impacts, with projections indicating a doubling of these impacts by 2060, according to the UN International Resource Panel (UN IRP) (Kami\u0144ski, 2020). The central question arises: How can more reusable or recyclable fractions be extracted from this challenging mixed waste? Traditional solutions like increasing public education, while viable, may require substantial time for meaningful impact. Additionally, legal and financial restrictions may expedite educational efforts but could lead to social resistance and electoral consequences. These observations underscore the importance of redefining waste within the CE concept, emphasizing its potential as a valuable raw material (D\u2019Admo et al., 2022; Luttenberger, 2020; Khan et al., 2023). This article endeavors to bridge the gaps in waste management strategies within the broader context of the CE, with a specific focus on the potential for achieving energy self-sufficiency in cities. We assert that pursuing 100% recycling and reuse of all waste fractions is economically unwarranted. Instead, specific waste fractions, when transformed into biogas or incinerated for heat and electricity production, represent more effective waste management practices. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide emissions generated by combustion can be mitigated through urban transformation into green cities, where increased vegetation assists in absorbing carbon dioxide from the air. To address these issues, we provide a comprehensive review focusing on the core principles of the CE and elucidating strategies for managing specific waste fractions. Our theoretical review provides a holistic perspective on the CE\u2019s evolving discourse. Within this review, we delve into the multifaceted dimensions of the CE, dissecting its theoretical foundations, including principles of waste reduction, resource reuse, and the extraction of value from waste materials. This theoretical contribution enables a deeper understanding of the CE\u2019s conceptual framework, offering valuable insights for researchers and policymakers engaged in sustainable waste management within this dynamic paradigm. To illustrate the multifaceted dynamics of waste management within the context of CE principles, we present the Orli Staw installation plan, a municipal waste treatment facility in Poland serving 23 municipalities with 350,000 residents. This case exemplifies the innovative potential of the CE by harnessing kitchen and garden biowaste to produce biogas, thereby reducing waste, promoting resource reuse, and achieving local energy self-sufficiency. By focusing on bio-waste and employing a fermentation module for biogas generation, the plant redefines waste as a valuable resource. This groundbreaking approach not only aligns with CE principles but also addresses critical challenges related to resource scarcity and environmental sustainability. The Orli Staw plant\u2019s transformation of waste into a valuable energy source offers a pioneering model for sustainable waste management, making it a significant case study with implications for circular economies worldwide. The primary contribution of this article is the synthesis of insights into the role of waste management in achieving energy self-sufficiency within the CE framework. By highlighting waste management\u2019s vital role in urban energy self-sufficiency, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach to waste management and resource utilization. This synthesis provides practical insights into the integration of waste management strategies into the broader context of sustainable urban development, offering a nuanced perspective on this critical aspect of CE implementation. In summary, our fundamental conclusion underscores the imperative for waste management to waste perceive as a dual asset: firstly, as a valuable raw material that can be reintegrated into the economy, and secondly, as a potent energy resource capable of enhancing the energy portfolio of cities. This dual perspective on waste not only aligns with the principles of CE but also offers a pragmatic solution to address contemporary challenges related to resource utilization and urban energy self-sufficiency. The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows: In Section 2, we embark on a theoretical exploration, offering a comprehensive review of waste management within the context of the CE framework. Section 3 takes a deep dive into the practical realm, focusing on the Orli Staw case study in Poland, where we substantiate the concept of waste as a valuable resource for energy transformation with empirical evidence. Finally, Section 4 serves as the culmination of our discourse, where we draw our key findings, and articulate our conclusive remarks. Theoretical framework of CE The view mentioned in the introduction that our planet is basically a huge spaceship speeding through space, recharged by solar energy and equipped with closed-circuit systems is becoming more and more popular in human society. There are many ways to understand and define the CE. One such definition defines the CE as a production and consumption model that involves sharing, borrowing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. This extends the product life cycle. In practice, this means minimizing waste. When a product\u2019s life cycle comes to an end, the raw materials and waste that comes from it should stay in the economy through recycling. They can be successfully reused, thus creating additional value. 1United Nations forecasts [based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Water Council] assume that by 2050 the world population will increase by 1\/3, which will translate into the pace of moving to cities and a 50% increase in demand for water and energy during this period (Lasecki et al., 2021). Circular fashion has been present in the literature since the late 1960s. The concept of Circural Fashion appeared in 2014 and is currently one of the most popular concepts of sustainable development in fashion (Global Fashion Agenda\u2019s 2020 Circural Fashion System Commitment was signed by 90 fashion brands). The phrases \u201cspaceship Earth\u201d (1960), \u201cstocks for processing\u201d (1966), The Closing Circle (1971), closed-loop economy (1981) alluded to CE (Meadows et al., 1973). The CE paradigm began to develop in the early 1970s, when scientists, politicians and recruits gathered around the Club of Rome began research on the future of the earth\u2019s natural environment, its limited raw material resources and the place occupied by humans in the ecosystem. The result of this research was the first report prepared for the Club of Rome entitled \u201cLimits to Growth\u201d (The Limits to Growth 1972). It was in this report that the idea of a CE emerged, where the authors of the report stated that: \u201cNatural ecosystems can absorb many waste products of human activity and process them into substances useable, or at least harmless to other forms of life\u201d. However, when a waste product is released in large quantities, natural absorption mechanisms can become saturated. The waste products of human civilization can accumulate in a given environment until they finally become visible, annoying and even harmful. Therefore, larger consuming countries can learn how to recover and regenerate used materials. They can develop new methods to increase the durability of products made from scarce raw materials. They can introduce social and economic patterns of behavior that would meet needs while minimizing (rather than maximizing) use and dissipation of irreplaceable substances that man currently possesses (Niutanen and Korhonen, 2003). CE is an economic concept in which products, materials and raw materials should remain in the economy if possible, and the generation of waste should be minimized as much as possible (Oberle et al., 2019). This idea considers all stages of the product life cycle, starting from its design, through production, consumption, collection as waste, to its management. CE is a model of economic development in which\u2013while maintaining the condition of efficiency\u2013the following basic assumptions are met: 1) the added value of raw materials\/resources, materials and products is maximized or the amount of waste generated is minimized, and the resulting waste is managed in accordance with the hierarchy of waste management methods (waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling, other recovery methods, disposal) (Pagotto and Halog, 2015)2. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation3 states that the CE is based on three principles: 1) limit waste and pollution; 2) circulate products and materials (at their highest value)and 3) regenerate nature. The first principle of the CE is to eliminate waste and pollution. Currently, our economy works in a take-make-waste system. We take raw materials from the Earth, we make products from them, and eventually we throw them away as waste. Much of this waste ends up in landfills or incinerators and is lost. This system cannot work in the long term because the resources on our planet are finite. The second principle of the CE is to circulate products and materials at their highest value. This means keeping materials in use, either as a product or, when that can no longer be used, as components or raw materials. This way, nothing becomes waste and the intrinsic value of products and materials are retained. The third principle of the CE is to regenerate nature. By moving from a take-make-waste linear economy to a CE, we support natural processes and leave more room for nature to thrive4. The CE system diagram, known as the butterfly diagram illustrates the continuous flow of materials in a CE.5There are two main cycles\u2013the technical cycle and the biological cycle. In the technical cycle, products and materials are kept in circulation through processes such as reuse, repair, remanufacture and recycling. In the biological cycle, the nutrients from biodegradable materials are returned to the Earth to regenerate nature5. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation on the left-hand side of the butterfly diagram is the biological cycle, which is for materials that can biodegrade and safely return to the earth. 6This cycle mainly concerns products that are consumed, such as food. However, some other biodegradable materials, such as cotton or wood, may eventually make their way from the technical cycle into the biological cycle once they have degraded to a point where they can no longer be used to make new products. At the heart of the biological cycle is the concept of regeneration. It is the third principle of the CE. Instead of continuously degrading nature, as we do in the linear economy, in the CE we build natural capital. Once food is harvested and consumed, the nutrients in organic waste streams can be collected, and returned to the soil via processes like composting and anaerobic digestion. If nutrients are not returned, soil becomes depleted, meaning farmers are forced to rely increasingly on chemical fertilisers to keep farmland productive. On the right-hand side of the butterfly diagram is the technical cycle, relevant for products that are used rather than consumed. The diagram shows that smaller inner loops are surrounded by the larger outer loops. These inner loops are where most value can be captured because they retain more of the embedded value of a product by keeping it whole. Take a smartphone, for example,\u2013a working phone is worth more than the sum of its parts because the time and energy that went into making it is not lost. Therefore, inner loops like sharing, maintaining, and reusing should be prioritized above the outer loops that see the product broken down and remade. These loops also represent a cost saving to customers and businesses as they make use of products and materials already in circulation, rather than investing in making them new. 7The approach to CE is changing around the world. Not only as a problem to solve, but also as a business opportunity. For example, in Denmark, cooperation within the CE framework between business and industry is proposed in order to change the approach to production and consumption, creating new businesses and new jobs to make the lifestyle more sustainable (Luttenberger, 2020). Individual economic sectors are taking the essence of CE more and more seriously. One such example is the transformation from a linear to a circular approach in the food production industry in Australia. M. Pagotto and A. Halog (Pagotto and Halog 2015) present recommendations for this industry, based on the research of other scientists, which, among other things, are to improve environmental sustainability: \u201cOur first recommendation is the implementation of a \u201csustainable resource management\u201d (SRM) for the entire Australian agri-food industry chain. SRM is an integrated approach that manages materials\/resource life cycles aiming to achieve economic efficiency and environmental sustainability (Fiksel, 2006). Implementing SRM will support the Australian food producers and suppliers in identifying inefficiencies in the production processes, reducing production and waste costs, increasing competitiveness and improving the producers. The second recommendation involves the implementation of integrated waste management, energy, and fertilizer production in large centralized (regional) units or smaller decentralized local units, such as farm scale or industrial districts (Niutanen and Korhonen 2003). This strategy can transform the current linear production system utilized in the Australian food industry to a roundput production system where the organic food wastes and wastewater are treated to produce energy, recycled water, and fertilizer, which are later returned as valuable inputs (Niutanen and Korhonen 2003). The third recommendation proposes the increase of biofuel\/bioenergy production in Australia using available, nonfood biomass by-products generated by the agri-food industry. The Australian government should distribute financial incentives for constructing biorefineries. These biorefineries will transform organic materials, such as agricultural residues and food wastes, into valuable biofuels and chemicals (Pagotto and Halog, 2015). The last recommendation suggests that the Australian government should invest in research, professional training, and dissemination of the \u201cmixed farming system\u201d (MFS). This system will minimize the costs and emissions generated by transportation of feedstock that is required to feed the livestock raised in feedlots system (Pagotto and Halog, 2015).\u201d The diagram and its description present the essence of the CE in a nutshell. The practical application of this idea encounters some resistance in the societies of various countries. According to one of the laws of harmony presented by Karol Adamiecki: \u201cThe Law of Inertia of Habits and the Law of Contradiction,\u201d any undertakings involving the introduction of specific innovations or improvements in the company evoke a certain resistance in the employee teams aimed at rejecting this change and restoring the current state. Therefore, it is of great importance to properly prepare changes, train employees and participate in the process of implementing improvements, limiting the scale of this resistance. 8,9The quoted law of inertia of habits and the law of contradiction can be applied not only to the employees of a given enterprise, but also to individual governments or population groups. One such exception is the Japanese city of Kamikatsu, where a special recycling center has been set up, where over 30 waste fractions are sorted. Thanks to such solutions, as much as 80 percent waste produced by the local community is reused, recycled or composted. Only 20 percent goes to landfills. Kamikatsu inspires other cities, including Turkey and San Diego, where a plan was announced to reduce landfilled waste by 75% by 2030. By 2040, it would become completely zero waste. New York has similarly ambitious plans\u2014it wants to reduce the amount of garbage to zero in the next 15 years10. Other examples of the transformation of waste management towards CE exemplified in Europe. Sweden use of heat generated in wastewater fermentation processes in heat pump systems. According to Gunnar Haglung, Haglung, 2011 about 80% of the heat in the Swedish district heating network, i.e. 40% of all heat, comes from energy sources that in many other countries of the world are not used at all but literally wasted. G. Haglung proposes that cities with up to 20,000 inhabitants residents invested in biomass-fired heating plants. In turn, cities with a population of 20,000 inhabitants up to 100 thousand inhabitants should invest in biomass-fired CHP plants, and in cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, municipal waste should be managed on site, among others in incineration plants in cogeneration with the use of biomass. In addition, Sweden also introduced a tax on CO 2 and for incineration plants operating without cogeneration in the generation of heat and electricity. Segregation at source popularized in Poland by Eng. Andrzej Bartoszkiewicz. In addition, since 2005, a full ban on landfilling has been in force, which was widely consulted with the Swedish society. Heat in Swedish cities equipped with district heating is supplied in addition to incineration plants, biogas, geothermal energy, heat pumps or fossil fuels from industrial heat waste. The Swedish example described shows the country\u2019s determination towards CE and the pursuit of energy independence. The entire economic mechanism is that energy is produced from waste delivered to, e.g., incineration plants, the cost of which is lower compared to coal or gas. Those who deliver waste must pay for it, which on the one hand, as mentioned, reduces the costs of energy production, and on the other hand, in a way, stimulates society to produce less waste, for the collection of which they also must pay. Swedish society has agreed to this transformation. Other societies are slower to adopt similar solutions. Due to the extensive discussion taking place on increasing the efficiency of the use of waste resources and thus converting energy, it is worth analyzing the possibilities of biogas production in solid waste processing installations. The presented case study concerns one of the most dynamically developing installations in Poland, which sorts waste, both municipal and industrial, for the recovery of the so-called commercial fractions and biodegradable waste for biogas production. Therefore, it seems that this example is worth disseminating where the preference is still mainly to store waste without considering it as a source of commercial products on the one hand, and on the other hand, the possibility of achieving energy independence first of all for a given installation, and then of other municipal entities or farms. homework. In Poland, the first installations producing biogas from municipal waste were built in 2010-2017. Most of them use a biofraction separated from mixed\/residual waste. Currently, most of them plan to change the input to selectively collected bio-waste. Some of them have undertaken investment activities in this area. Biogas produced from mixed waste is characterized by a high content of H 2 S reaching 2,000 ppm and a high content of silicon compounds (siloxanes), which requires its cleaning and makes it difficult to operate cogeneration engines. The average biogas productivity in such installations is in the range of 80\u2013120 m3\/Mg (source: Szewczyk\u2019s own survey). So far, in Poland there is no installation producing biomethane from biogas, injected into the grid or used to drive means of transport in the form of bioCNG or bioLNG. This is due to the lack of favorable legislation enabling the injection of biomethane into the grid. Powering vehicles with biomethane is also at the planning stage. In all installations operating in Poland that process solid waste, the generated electricity and heat is used for its own needs, and surplus electricity is sold to the grid. One of the installations operates in the trigeneration mode and has a bromolite absorption refrigeration system. This system generates cold from the waste heat, which is used for air-conditioning the rooms. Currently, in Poland, approximately 200,000 Mg\/year of bio-waste is managed in operating fermentation installations. Generally, it is estimated that the amount of biowaste generated in Poland exceeds 2,000,000 Mg\/year. With a conservative estimated average productivity of operating installations of approx. 100 m (Fiksel, 2006)\/Mg, this gives a potential biogas production capacity of approx. 200 million m (Fiksel, 2006)\/year. This biogas has a methane content of 50%\u201360%. These installations also have the ability to co-digestate other types of waste, not only from municipal sources, but also from trade, catering and agri-food processing, which can significantly increase Poland\u2019s potential in this area. The advantage of this type of installation is their territorial dispersion as well as the stability and predictability of energy production, as well as its controllability, which, unlike other RES (wind, sun), stabilizes the power grid, reducing the need for its expansion. Case studies In many societies processes like Kamikatsu proceed relatively slowly. This is illustrated by the example of the Municipal Waste Treatment Plant Orli Staw (ZUOK). This plant serves 23 municipalities with a population of approximately 350,000. These inhabitants produce approx. 120,000 Mg\/year of municipal waste. All generated municipal waste goes to the ZUOK. This stream also includes selectively collected kitchen and garden biowaste. The installation in Orli Staw, as in other installations in Poland, the level of recycling and its structure are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 TABLE 1. Practical possibilities of achieving recycling levels on the example of the installation in Orli Staw. The data presented in Table 1 shows that the efficiency of waste segregation in some European societies is low. The so-called mixed waste (unsegregated) from 50%\u201380% in the structure of waste collected from residents. From a practical point of view, this waste is basically the easiest to landfill or burn to obtain electricity and heat. However, the question is how can more reusable or recyclable fractions be obtained from this mixed waste? The first answer that comes to mind is to increase the level of education of the inhabitants. This process may take many years. Legal and financial restrictions can also be applied, which theoretically should accelerate the education process, or trigger social protests, which then translate into the results of elections to central or local authorities. Generally, the idea of CE is to define waste not as waste, but as a raw material. In the Orli Staw plant, the focus is now on the energy use of bio-waste by installing a module for obtaining biogas from this waste (fermentation module). This module uses both green and kitchen waste. The technology used is so universal that it produces biogas even from contaminated biodegradable fractions. This biogas is then used to produce electricity and heat for the plant, and surpluses are stored for resale. From the residues of these wastes after the fermentation and composting process, solid and liquid fertilizer is obtained. According to P. Szewczyk, the solution used for selectively collected municipal bio-waste is better than in the case of rural biogas plants, which require a more stable and clean material input. The fermentation installation at ZUOK Orli Staw was built in 2021-2022 and commissioned in 2023. After the first stage of implementation, it has the capacity to process 15,000 Mg\/year. The input to the installation is mainly selectively collected municipal bio-waste. Since 2017, when the implementation of selective collection was successively started, their number has been gradually increasing. In addition, the fermentation charge can also be expired food and expired food products from trade and gastronomy. It is also possible to manage liquid waste from the agri-food industry and agriculture. The amount of delivered bio-waste is gradually increasing. In 2016, there were 4,122 Mg, in 2017\u20135,372 Mg, in 2018 already 6,332 Mg, in 2019\u20137,836 Mg. In 2020, the amount of biowaste supplied increased significantly to 14,442 Mg, a year later to 17,548, and in 2022 to 18,528 Mg. This phenomenon is shown in Figure 1. FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1. Delivery of selectively collected municipal bio-waste to ZUOK (Orli Staw) in 2016-2022 Source: own study based on data from ZUOK (Orli Staw). In the period from 1 March 2023 to 31 May 2023, during the start-up of the fermentation installation, the average biogas productivity was 98.96 m (Fiksel, 2006)\/Mg of feedstock. At that time, after the injection of the inoculum and the start of the process, the amount of fed waste gradually increased, reaching the target value of approx. 41 Mg\/day. This amount was corrected based on the analysis of parameters and the course of the fermentation process. The produced biogas has an average methane content of 60.17%. This content ranges from 59% to 62.2%. The produced biogas has an H 2 S content of approx. 200 ppm. Before being directed to the cogeneration engine, the biogas is purified in a biological column and\/or in columns filled with activated carbon. Biogas is also dried in refrigeration dryers. The cogeneration unit with a peak power of 550 kW operates with variable power depending on the current energy needs of the plant. The heat energy recovered from the cooling of the cogeneration engine and the cooling of exhaust gases is directed to the in-house network. It is used for the technological needs of the fermentation installation, mainly for heating the fermenter, heating the premises of the plant and producing hot water. The role of energy storage in the form of biogas is performed by a double-layer biogas tank with a capacity of approx. 2,500 m (Fiksel, 2006). After the fermentation process, the digestate goes to the dewatering section consisting of two screw presses and one decanter centrifuge. The solid fraction goes to the aerobic process and then is a substrate to produce a natural organic fertilizer. The liquid fraction is directed to a buffer tank and then used in agricultural fields as an organic fertilizer. The fermentation installation at the ZUOK, after extension with a second fermenter with a capacity of approx. 15,000 Mg\/year, is planned to operate as a biomethane production installation in the form of bioCNG or bioLNG. It will be the fuel used to propel own means of transport and possibly also used as fuel for the needs of companies cooperating with the ZUOK collecting waste from residents. Another possibility of energy use of waste are wastewater treatment plants where biogas is also obtained. An example is the treatment plant in Tychy in Silesia, where biodegradable industrial waste is added to municipal sewage, which improves the amount of biogas obtained. From this biogas, electricity and heat are obtained in such quantities that, apart from the wastewater treatment plant\u2019s own consumption, electricity and heat are used to operate the municipal aqua park, and surplus electricity is sold to the power grid. The uniqueness of this solution lies in the fact that in the vast majority of sewage treatment plants energy and heat are used only for their own purposes. Possibilities of improving the efficiency of the CE The motivation of this paper stems from the use of CE in practice in the context of waste management. This concept is becoming more and more popular. Waste is no longer treated as unnecessary garbage, but as raw materials from which new goods can be produced or transformed, for example, into heat or electricity. Biogas can be obtained from other waste, which in turn can be used to power engines or produce electricity and heat. The transformation of many economies, including European ones, towards CE also seems to be a necessity due to the ongoing Ukrainian-Russian conflict, which has disrupted the established economic order consisting in, among other things, purchasing cheap energy carriers from Russia. This conflict thus highlighted the risk of energy carriers supplied from one or a few places. This also includes the potential risk of interrupting the supply of plutonium or uranium ore to nuclear power plants from their current mining sites. Using the potential of waste and popularizing the opportunities offered by broadly understood CE seems to be invaluable. In addition, experience in implementing CE solutions may be useful for planned space travel. The example from Orle Staw shows dynamic changes in the approach to waste in Poland. From a financial point of view, the installation from Orly Staw generates profit, which is then transferred to the development of this company towards CE. More and more cities in Poland are starting to transform their installations in a similar way. It is a slow but steady process. Based on the example from Orle Staw and other examples described in the literature review, the following actions are recommended. 1. The design of incineration plants should assume the shortest possible payback period for investment outlays. In Sweden, for example, the payback period for the construction of a waste incineration plant is approximately 4\u20135 years, in Poland it is 20\u201330 years. This proves a more rational approach to the CE in this country from an economic point of view. 2. Such incineration plants should be built not only to dispose of waste while generating electricity and heat, but also as cement plants. The combustion temperature in a cement plant is higher than in an incinerator, which provides greater opportunities for environmentally safe disposal of hazardous waste, which may even be present in municipal waste. Moreover, the current Ukrainian-Russian war will end 1 day and the demand for cement will certainly increase, which rationally justifies the construction of such combined plants. In this way, flammable waste fractions can be used more effectively. 3. It is postulated to reconstruct each wastewater treatment plant so that it produces a larger amount of biogas than its own needs, also using industrial bio-waste. 4. Fermentation plants for the production of biogas from solid bio-waste should be built at each waste collection facility. This biogas would be used to produce heat and electricity for own needs and for sale, including as biofuel for engines. 5. Packaging should consist of materials that can be easily sorted. The effort here is also on the side of packaging manufacturers. In societies less convinced of such segregation at source, economic incentives to donate such packaging should be introduced. It would be worth applying an additional waste management hierarchy, i.e., separating cost-effective waste fractions such as aluminum, other metals, glass, waste paper, biodegradable and other economically viable fractions, and those that should only be treated as combustible material. 6. Collection points for such packaging should be located in places frequented by residents, e.g., shops, so that the resident does not feel the inconvenience of such a delivery of used packaging. 7. The logistics of collecting used packaging from such points should be improved. For example, each of the 14 distribution centers of one of the largest retail chains in Poland sends around 200 vehicles daily to deliver supplies to its retail outlets. These vehicles return to the city center lightly loaded or empty, covering around 20,000 km on the way back. Annually, this gives one center (assuming only 300 days of operation per year) 6,000,000 km, and for the entire network: 90,000,000 km. Fuel used when running empty: 20,700,000 L 22If those delivering products to stores collected used packaging at the same time, i.e., they would also provide collection services for such selected waste fractions, the number of so-called waste collections could be reduced. empty runs. 8. Disseminate the so-called sorting at source using efficient logistics. The solution proposed, among others, by A. Bartoszkiewicz assumes the employment of people in the so-called houses\u2014sorting rooms located in multi-family buildings. These people would perform additional sorting of mixed waste on site. Separated materials would be collected, for example, by vehicles delivering products to nearby stores, in order to avoid empty journeys and reduce transport costs. You can also consider running a deposit system by the operators of such a sorting house. The presented recommendations and examples, including the example of the Orle Staw installation, may constitute a model or anchor for improving the efficiency of the economy thanks to the CE concept. It is not a problem to transform the linear economy into a circular one by spending huge sums of money. The challenge and logical path is to do this while improving the economic efficiency of given industries or enterprises. One such example, apart from others mentioned in the article, is the constant transformation of the Orli Staw installation, which is slowly becoming an enterprise stimulating the effective management of solid waste. In the future, new activities in the CE area may appear at this installation based on economic calculations, involving even various social and business groups in conducting these activities, which will also allow for the expansion of the CE idea in Polish society.

We are rethinking how waste can be avoided, reused, recycled and remanufactured as part of our circular economy research. Our Circular Economy for Missions initiative targets an 80 per cent reduction in waste going to landfill in Australia by 2030. Let\u2019s start simple and imagine a different life for your washing machine. It\u2019s served you for years, and now it\u2019s ready to retire. But it doesn\u2019t get discarded in a landfill. Instead, it\u2019s returned to the place of purchase, so it\u2019s parts can be used again. This is an example of a circular economy approach. It's a key strategy for Heinz Schandl, who leads our Circular Economy for Missions (CE4M) initiative. The program aims to support Australia\u2019s transition to a circular economy by developing new products and services for materials which would ordinarily go to waste. Heinz tells us more. What is a circular economy? The concept of a circular economy focuses on the sustainable management of materials within the economy. It puts the emphasis on designing materials and products with a zero-waste mindset. This means products are designed in such a way that they can be used again, or even multiple times, to maximise their value. Australia\u2019s circularity rate is around 5 per cent. However, it\u2019s estimated that circular products from waste resources could provide a $210 billion economic boost for Australia through exports to 2050. This provides a significant opportunity. Why do we need a circular economy? The world is continuing to industrialise and urbanise. To build infrastructure, power our cities, and cater to our everyday needs, we extract and harvest a myriad of materials. This is in the form of biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores, and minerals. As a result, our global material consumption has surged to a staggering 100 billion tonnes annually. This translates to 12.5 tonnes per person, each year! This carries an environmental toll. To improve this, we need to think outside of the square and change the current linear supply chain. In this case, we need to think circular! How can we build a circular economy? My focus is to reach a point where we don\u2019t even think of materials that have been used as waste, but as an asset we can reuse. Most of the materials we extract are consumed once and subsequently discarded \u2013 either emitted into the atmosphere, disposed to landfills, or inadvertently leaked into our ecosystems. Supporting a circular economy will ensure materials can be used again. This will reduce demand on resources and the environment, while providing ongoing economic gains. A benefit of circular economy principles is that they apply to a broad range of sectors, from construction to food. What are the benefits of a circular economy? Australia is the world's largest exporter of raw materials, annually shipping out 1.5 billion tonnes. These resources are largely exported. Meanwhile, the bulk of consumer goods are imported. A circular economy could support many domestic sectors including agriculture, renewable energy, fisheries, forestry, and mining resources. Designing materials, products, and processes with circularity in mind could also provide new opportunities in the rapidly expanding Asian markets. Embracing a circular economy would also help Australia achieve its net-zero pathway, reduce emissions and reduce pollution. What does a circular economy future look like? CE4M is part of our portfolio of missions to help address some of Australia\u2019s biggest challenges. It is an enabling program to embed circular economy principles across a range of research areas and sectors, including plastic waste, manufacturing, agriculture and energy. We are also collaborating with government, industry and communities to provide scientific knowledge to build a more circular system for Australia. This includes developing digital solutions, data science, and advanced materials for new circular economy markets. Furthermore, our research will also inform policy as Australia transitions to building a circular economy and closing the loop on waste.","filter_flag":1}

Industry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute state-level laws that prevent bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags. Over a dozen states currently have preemptive laws on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics, though some of the same states are also trying to pass anti-preemption laws. Fundamentally, to solve the plastic pollution crisis, society must address the root problem: plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap. One way to improve recycling\u2014and prevent unwanted health effects and environmental problems\u2014would be to simplify and standardize the process of plastic production, Walker-Franklin says. Currently, more than 10,000 chemicals are used in the production of plastics, and upward of 3,200 have \u201cone or more hazardous properties of concern,\u201d with the potential to harm humans and wildlife, according to UNEP. Very little or nothing is known about the health effects or basic properties of thousands more. Another way to improve recycling would be to find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials instead of having to sort everything first. One promising technique, described in an October 2020 study coauthored by Julie Rorrer, then a researcher at MIT, can process polypropylene and polyethylene into propane. Another process, described in a study published in Science the same month, can break down mixtures of common consumer plastics and re-form them into a bioplastic, in part by using an engineered soil bacterium. Others dream of a day when microbes could be used to recycle or clean up all this waste. One French biotechnology company, Carbios, opened a pilot plant in September 2021 to break down and recycle PET using an engineered form of an enzyme first discovered in compost; it\u2019s currently building a full-scale facility due to open in 2025. In theory, this type of recycling could be truly circular, as it wouldn\u2019t require the high heat that normally causes much of the degradation seen with recycled plastics. A microbe discovered in Japan in 2016, called Ideonella sakaiensis, produces two other enzymes that can break down PET. This microbe is especially intriguing because it is the first one identified that can live solely upon plastic as a food source. MIT researcher Linda Zhong-Johnson is working to create more efficient versions of the enzymes by tinkering with microbial genes. So far, one mutation she has identified creates an enzyme that appears to be up to 30% more efficient than its original wild form. Reducing demand Fundamentally, to solve the plastic pollution crisis, society must address the root problem: plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap because polymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require policy and behavioral changes small and large. As an example of the former, policymakers in Washington, DC, instituted a five-cent charge on plastic bags that began in 2010. Estimates suggest that the number of bags used quickly dropped\u2014by more than half in the months after it was instituted\u2014and the quantity found in local waterways dropped between 30% and 70% thereafter. Seemingly tiny changes like this can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution. Meanwhile, a global EPR scheme would be an example of a major shift, and the UN process is seeking other big changes to the status quo. Of course, such changes will be difficult, but they can be instituted in gradual ways that don\u2019t hurt businesses, Boachie says: \u201cMy hope emanates from the fact that what we are talking about is not something that will impede the growth and success of any company.\u201d On the contrary, he adds, creating incentives for alternatives will spur innovation and create new jobs. A lot of such innovation will doubtless be needed to reverse situations like what I saw in the Connecticut salt marsh. At one point we came upon a couple of osprey nests from which plastic strands billowed, unwittingly collected by the birds as they built their nests. Later, we found a vinyl firehose lodged intractably in the muck between oysters. I couldn\u2019t pull it out, nor could I cut into it with a small pocketknife. We reluctantly left it behind.

One way to do that is by approaching waste as a resource that can be recycled to bring down costs, improve patient well-being and reduce environmental impact. From Production to Disposal: Understanding the Environmental Impact of Scrubs While medical scrubs are crucial for maintaining hygiene, it\u2019s important to also analyze their environmental impact. These are the main ways in which scrubs pose sustainability challenges from production to disposal. Fabrics Scrubs are usually made from a mixture of polyester and cotton. The latter is a water-intensive crop and its production can aggravate water scarcity in places where it\u2019s grown. Polyester, a byproduct of petroleum, needs an enormous amount of energy in its manufacturing stage. Plus, it\u2019s not biodegradable. Dyes Chemical dyes are needed to create colors in medical scrubs. Their use can release dangerous pollutants into the soil and waterways near the production facilities. Since these chemicals accumulate in the nearby ecosystems, they pose serious risks to humans, cattle, and other animals and birds. Transportation The transportation of medical scrubs also contributes to carbon emissions. Whether it\u2019s from a production facility to a distribution center or from a healthcare facility to a laundry service, there are serious environmental challenges that the industry needs to be aware of. The problem is more severe since most manufacturing plants are situated overseas. Disposal Single-use scrubs usually end up in landfills, where it takes years for the synthetic fabrics used in their manufacturing to decompose. Landfills have been identified as \u201csuper emitters\u201d of methane and the third-largest source of this greenhouse gas. The Importance of Closing the Loop in Healthcare Products According to the American Medical Association, one of the biggest challenges to sustainable medical care is the disposal of healthcare waste. Switching to reusable healthcare products can help reduce the environmental impact of the sector. The solution is to \u201cclose the loop.\u201d Closing the loop involves manufacturing products that can be used, reused and recycled. Instead of a linear model where products invariably end up as waste, it relies on a circular process. This significantly reduces wastage and the strain on surrounding ecosystems and communities. In healthcare, closing the loop is a transformative and sustainable approach that can redefine how products are manufactured, transported, used and recycled. Exploring the Environmental Benefits of Circular Scrub Design Using the principles of the circular economy, circular scrub design creates products that are recyclable and regenerative. This is different from the traditional \u201ctake, make and dispose\u201d philosophy in manufacturing. Circular scrub design is a holistic strategy of reusing and recycling that provides several key benefits. Less waste Circular scrub design minimizes waste generation in healthcare. Producers can minimize the amount of waste by creating products that can be reused and recycled. Certain products can even be upcycled, which will divert chemicals and fabrics from waste streams. This goes a long way in preserving natural ecosystems. Lower resource consumption One reason there\u2019s greater interest in sustainable and ethical scrubs because the process of circular scrub design lowers resource consumption. When scrubs are designed to be repaired, disassembled, reused and repurposed, there\u2019s reduced pressure to constantly source new raw materials. Smaller carbon footprint Circular scrub design can reduce the need for energy-intensive production processes and transportation. If products can be locally sourced and effectively recycled, there will be a significant reduction in the overall carbon footprint. Research has found that reusable hospital gowns can lower greenhouse gas emissions by 66 percent. The Future of Sustainable Healthcare: Innovative Recycling Techniques for Medical Scrubs Several recycling methods are redefining scrub usage in the healthcare industry. These are some of the most innovative. Biodegradable fabrics Plant-based fibers\u2014including organic cotton, hemp and bamboo\u2014are now being explored as alternatives to traditional materials. They decompose faster in landfills and reduce the collective reliance on petroleum-based products. Their decomposition also makes the soil richer, which makes the ecosystem healthier. Selective fiber recycling Using advanced technology, researchers are separating natural and synthetic fibers. Breaking down the fabrics makes it easy to recycle and reconstitute them into new materials and products. Importantly, these products don\u2019t compromise on either performance or comfort. Microbial decomposition Microorganisms such as enzymes and bacteria can break down certain fabrics. This microbial degradation makes it easy to return these components to the ecosystem, instead of letting used garments and scrubs languish in landfills. On-demand production On-demand production technologies such as 3D printing allow healthcare institutions to create customized scrubs when they need them. There\u2019s no need to order these in bulk, which will lead to waste. There\u2019s also no need for storage or transport since it\u2019s produced at the site. A Greener Future for Healthcare: How Circular Fashion Reshapes Medical Workwear The healthcare sector is consciously moving away from its reliance on single-use garments to circular fashion. By reusing products, reducing waste and recycling materials, the industry is transforming the way medical workwear is manufactured and used. The reusable system has a 31 percent lower impact on climate change when compared to the disposable alternative. Closed-loop systems in healthcare can not only foster sustainability but also lead to demonstrable cost savings. With reduced need for new garments, healthcare providers can redirect their resources towards enhancing patient outcomes. That\u2019s how circular fashion is creating win-win scenarios for caregivers and care receivers.","filter_flag":1}

Black text indicates a call to action. Credit: Nature Communications (2023). DOI: 10.1038\/s41467-023-42499-6 As global demand for wood is forecast to increase by up to 170% by 2050, a new study published in Nature Communications demonstrates the importance of achieving net zero targets through the better use of waste wood and proposes solutions for how this could be achieved. Wood harvested from managed forests is increasingly recognized as an important source of renewable biomaterial. It can deliver major benefits for reducing global warming, including capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as trees grow, storing that carbon in products manufactured from the harvested wood, and reducing emissions when these products are used in place of materials like concrete and steel. A team of researchers from Bangor University, the University of Galway in Ireland and Woodknowledge Wales, using a rigorous analysis of the whole life cycle of this system, found that potential benefits for net zero are not being maximized with the current way that wood products are used in U.K. While less than 1% of waste wood goes to landfill in U.K., far too many wood products are simply burnt after their first use as biomass for generating electricity or heat, when instead they could be re-used or recycled into new products that continue to store their carbon. The inefficiency of the present system also means that trees are harvested at a much greater rate than is necessary to provide new wood for manufacturing. This really matters for the U.K. as the imports of wood products in 2022 cost \u00a311.5 billion. The evidence produced by this research shows that improving the use of waste wood products would deliver a rapid and sustained reduction of 78% in carbon emissions by 2050 compared with the current, mainly single-use approach. This immediate decarbonization benefit results from the reduction in demand for newly harvested timber and compliments the slower, more long-term benefits of planting new forests for wood production. Combining all of these approaches would achieve a reduction in emissions equivalent to 258.8 million tons of carbon dioxide, cumulatively by 2050 (which equals 61% of the total of net territorial emissions of the U.K. in the single year of 2021). Drawing on interviews with industry leaders, the study also explores how it would be possible to deliver a more circular model for wood use in reality. It indicates that: the industry needs to collaborate in new ways to provide the necessary cross-sector coordination; proposals for government policy interventions such as compulsory deconstruction plans for buildings are required, and; manufacturers need to extend responsibility for how their products are used (and reused) to maximize the benefits for slowing global warming. Eilidh Forster, a Ph.D. researcher at Bangor University and lead author of the study commented \"The U.K. is currently able to produce only a fraction of the wood it requires, yet recovered wood 'waste' is an under-valued resource. Improved transparency, reporting and management of recovered wood could create a multitude of circular business opportunities.\" John Healey, study co-author and Professor of Forest Sciences at Bangor University emphasized that \"planting new production forests to meet future wood demand is a very important priority for achieving net zero, however it will take several decades for this benefit to be realized, and we can't afford to wait that long to reduce the current rate of global warming. Therefore, we also need to act urgently to increase the efficiency with which we reuse current wood products to reduce the pressure that we are placing on global forests to meet our needs.\" David Styles, associate professor in agri-sustainability at the University of Galway and co-author of the study explained that \"to substantially increase the efficiency of the whole system will require some significant changes in the wood using industries in U.K., backed-up by better-targeted government policies, to substantially improve their co-ordination from afforestation to better wood recovery and reuse.\" Gary Newman, chief executive of Woodknowledge Wales and co-author of the study observed that \"moving to a circular economy is difficult but absolutely essential if we are to meet both our future decarbonization targets as well as our future resource needs. This paper shows the size of the win and makes practical suggestions for how we might get there. Woodknowledge Wales is an experiment in the kind of cross-sector coordination advocated by this research.\" More information: Eilidh J.

Even though it is both organic and inorganic waste that contribute to the transition to this new planetary epoch\u2014in which human activity has become the dominant force shaping Earth\u2019s climate and ecosystem\u2014it is the chemical composition, durability and omnipresence of plastics that make some scholars designate our age as the Plasticene. Considering that Indonesia is ranked as the world\u2019s second-biggest marine plastic polluter, one might refer to this large archipelagic country as plastipelago. Indeed, a comparable designation was made by Dandhy Dwi Laksono and Rahung Nasution for their documentary film Pulau Plastik (\u201cPlastic Island\u201d) that explores the magnitude of plastic pollution in Indonesia. However, the postulated age of the Plasticene should denote not only our plastic footprint and its impact on both people and the environment, but also the pliability of contemporary waste management regimes, where waste can be seen as both a problem and an opportunity. What this ambiguity shows is that our modern waste is not only difficult to handle, but also difficult to define. This is especially so in Indonesia, where more than half of the country\u2019s population is still without access to basic waste collection services, and where the government of President Joko Widodo is promoting the economic value of waste as part of a wider effort to address the country\u2019s waste crisis. With Indonesia standing at a critical juncture of a waste crisis, one should welcome the fact that in 2017, the Indonesian government has adopted the universally popular anti-waste strategy known as the \u201ccircular economy\u201d as the new paradigm for its national policy on the management of solid waste. Known as Indonesia Clean from Waste (ICFW), the aim of this policy is to reduce by 30% the total annual production of waste by 2025, and to handle the remaining 70% according to environmentally friendly and effective technologies. In the province of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), where I conducted my doctoral field research on the island of Sumbawa, the government of Governor Zulkieflimansyah has translated this policy into an implementing regulation at the provincial level under the flagship name of NTB Zero Waste. Here, the term \u201czero waste\u201d is used to communicate the goal of waste prevention, while the notion of circular economy refers to specific mechanisms through which to achieve that objective. Unlike the current linear economic model of \u201ctake\u2013make\u2013dispose\u201d, the circular economy recognises that natural resources are finite and aims to eliminate waste by keeping materials in circulation for as long as possible, through strategies such as reusing, recycling and responsible manufacture. This said, the circular economy can play an important role both in making waste management systems more resilient and in strengthening national self-sufficiency by lowering of the import demand of virgin and secondary materials. In Indonesia alone, this could mean reducing the amount of waste going to landfills and increasing the quality and quantity of locally sourced plastics as \u201cfeedstock\u201d for recycling and thus reducing the country\u2019s dependence on waste imports. While waste imports to Indonesia are small compared to the total production of waste in the country, they too have a negative impact on Indonesia\u2019s environment and society. Overall, the aim of the circular economy is to close loops of resource flows by galvanising people and industries into \u201cdurable\u201d entities able to turn waste into a resource. This ambition can be seen in the words of Siti Nurbaya Bakar, the Minister of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), who in 2021 said that now is the time \u201cto manage waste in ways that can make a real contribution to economic growth\u201d. This was echoed by the Vice-Governor of NTB, Sitti Rohmi Djalilah, who argued that waste cannot be seen as a problem; instead, it has to be managed as a blessing. There is, of course, an inherent incongruity in this statement, for \u201cblessing\u201d, by definition, does not have to be managed. Here, by drawing on data from my doctoral thesis, I trace the development of the ICFW policy through the policy\u2019s processes of problem definition to solution design so as to identify some of the key challenges and (limits) of this na\u00efve and hasty rebranding of waste as resource. Problem definition Broadly speaking, public policies are enacted following the problematisation of an issue. Often expressed in the form of a crisis, an issue is something that can be defined as unwanted outcomes of an action (or lack thereof) that affect a certain group of people. However, crisis is not merely a moment of panic but also an opportunity for reflection in the sense of a critical moment that can lead to social change. There are two distinct, yet interrelated crises that led to the enactment of the ICFW policy. The first refers to the actual crisis of waste that is manifested most viscerally in the country\u2019s clogged up rivers, filthy beaches, toxic air and overflowing landfills. For illustration, the material evidence of such crisis can also be found in more obscure places, such as local abattoirs\u2014where it is common for Indonesian meat merchants to find plastic discards in animal entrails. While these plastics will not be consumed by humans, which is why they have been put aside following their discovery, the toxins and chemicals that are associated with these materials can undoubtedly enter our food chain through a process known as \u201ctrophic transfer\u201d. There are multiple reasons why finding plastics in the stomachs of beef cattle is anything but uncommon for abattoir workers in Indonesia. Given the lack of available grasslands caused by changes in land function, some cattle herders in Indonesia use landfills as \u201cpastures\u201d for their livestock. By doing so they help to reduce the amount of food waste in Indonesian landfills, for there is little incentive to valorise organic waste in Indonesia, due to the country\u2019s fertiliser subsidy policy. In this context, this animal infrastructure is sustained insofar as it helps to sustain human livelihood and reduce the pressures put on landfills due to increased food consumption. However, animals do get sick as their digestive systems become clogged up with plastics. Due to high rates of littering along riverbanks and roadsides, it is common nowadays to also find plastic discards in the entrails of cows that feed on grasslands. Perhaps the most littered (and landfilled) items in Indonesia, single-use plastic bags are used excessively not only in traditional markets and modern retails in urban centres, but also by vendors and their customers in more remote rural areas. The second crisis refers to the crisis of reputation that was sparked by a study conducted by a group of scientists led by Jenna R. Jambeck from the University of Georgia (USA) that gave Indonesia the stigmatising label of the world\u2019s second-biggest contributor to marine plastic pollution, after China. At first, the government of Indonesia tried to dispute this study by proposing to make its own research on the matter of marine plastic pollution. Such protestation was, according to Dr Dirhamsyah\u2014the Director of Research Centre for Oceanography at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)\u2014a matter of Indonesia\u2019s reputation. Nevertheless, a detailed examination of a range of government and academic publications shows clearly the influence that Jambeck\u2019s study had on the enactment of the ICFW policy. With the need to clean the nation not only from its waste, but also from the stain on its reputation, the architects of the ICFW policy relied on the characterisation of waste as a major problem. Hence, it is no surprise that in Indonesia, like elsewhere in the world, waste is often represented as a monster. Related Power, illegality and impunity in Indonesia\u2019s plantation zone Palm oil companies can act with impunity because of corporate\u2013state collusion and a lack of organised resistance. This evocation can be seen, for example, in Riyana Rizki\u2019s online fairy tale Raksasa Sampah di Kerajaan Lolontar (Garbage Monster in Lolontar Kingdom). In this short story, the Queen of Lolontar is shocked as she witnesses her people running away from a giant creature made from littered garbage. With an heirloom sword in her hand, the Queen runs towards the garbage monster and slays it with a single slash. \u201cThis is the result of your littering\u201d, the Queen says to her people as a cloud of thick black smoke escapes from the monster\u2019s body. Shaken by the experience and ashamed of their habits, the people of Lolontar promise not to litter again. Here, as in Indonesia, the problem of waste is attributed, in large part, to littering behaviour. However, this failure to keep discards within the technopolitical domain of manageable waste should be understood as having an array of causal factors. These include the country\u2019s shift to a consumption-oriented economy and the resulting changes in consumption practices from biodegradable to plastic materials, as well as the failure to meet these transformations with necessary developments in waste management infrastructure and environmental education. Another reason why this tale is interesting is because it chooses a female leader to confront both the monster and the immoral actions of the populace. This reflects quite nicely on the fact that women in Indonesia are the key agents of kebersihan (cleanliness). This gendered division of labour in waste management can be seen not only in the brushing, sweeping, dusting and washing activities of Indonesian women across different cultural groups, but also in the relevant positions of authority that are occupied by female leaders. Take, for example, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, the Minister of Environment and Forestry and Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, the Director General of Waste and Toxic Waste Management at the MoEF. In terms of Indonesia\u2019s bureaucratic structures, these two women are the most senior figures responsible for addressing the country\u2019s waste problem by promoting the circular economy, including its ambition to create entrepreneurially-minded individuals who would recognise and take advantage of the economic value of waste. Within such discourse, waste is no longer represented as a problem. Instead, it is seen as an opportunity or a resource. Solution design The most important instrument of the ICFW policy through which to encourage citizens to participate in the circular economy is the waste bank program. Waste banks (bank sampah) are private or semi-private waste collection facilities where people can exchange different recyclables for money or services. At present, there are around 8,000 waste banks in the country, mainly on the highly populated island of Java that is also home to the majority of recycling companies in Indonesia. As part of the enactment of the ICFW policy, the national government has instructed local governments to help establish at least 31,000 new units across the whole of Indonesia by 2025. One key objective behind the desired proliferation of waste banks is to encourage people to separate their waste\u2014a practice that has previously been done exclusively by the highly stigmatised informal waste pickers (pemulung) who collect recyclables at landfills and kerbsides, and then sell their stock to waste collectors (pengepul) further up the supply chain. In terms of the circular economy, separating products and materials at the end of their life cycle is a crucial action for an optimised recycling, for it reduces leakage and contamination. While waste banks can increase public participation and awareness and make waste management systems in Indonesia more resilient, their proliferation across the country is relatively slow and their impact on recycling rates is moderate when compared to the contribution made by those working in the informal sector. In 2021, Siti Nurbaya Bakar claimed that waste management was one of the few businesses sectors in Indonesia that continued to grow during the pandemic. However, it was also claimed, by her Ministry, that waste banks reported a significant drop in revenue during this crisis, mainly because of social distancing measures. This means that the reason why the waste management sector proved resilient during the pandemic is mostly because of the informal waste workers, especially pemulung, who continued to retrieve recyclables from landfills during the health crisis. It is important to note that some people have joined the informal sector and become pemulung precisely because of the pandemic and the related lack of social security and job opportunities. Even though the informal waste sector forms a vital part of the entities involved in waste management in Indonesia, its contribution to the system has long been unrecognised and uncompensated. Such devaluation stems from the historical association of informal activities with poverty and criminality. For example, during the authoritarian New Order regime (1966\u20131998), scavenging for waste was made into an illegal activity because it conflicted with modern policies of land-use and town planning. In today\u2019s Indonesia, it is not uncommon to see signs in front of urban neighbourhoods and complexes that read, Pemulung Dilarang Masuk (No Scavengers). The fact that the ICFW initiative makes no consideration for this informal infrastructure, suggests that the policy may not only seek to make Indonesia clean from waste, but also clean from the informal waste sector. This can be seen, for example, in the policy\u2019s strategic plan to establish number of parental waste banks that would be equipped with waste processing technologies (i.e. press and waste shredding machines) needed to process plastics before they could be sold to the recycling companies. This enables waste bank operators to sell plastics within the waste bank family instead of having to go to informal waste collectors who have historically been adept at preparing plastics for recycling. By seeking to circumvent pengepul and by reducing the amount of waste otherwise available to pemulung, the waste bank program is illustrative of how the circular economy and the related commodification and formalisation of waste can lead to the \u201cgentrification of reuse\u201d. Unlike the informal waste sector, waste banks are seen by policymakers as having the potential to nurture environmental and entrepreneurial values among the populace. Hence, besides helping to raise awareness through waste separation, waste banks also serve as places of experimentation where waste bank operators (and their customers) are encouraged to upcycle some of the collected materials into new products, such as grocery baskets, plant pots, handbags, or even paving blocks or bricks, all made, to varying degrees, from plastic waste. These upcycled products are often referred to using the prefix \u201ceco\u201d\u2014hence eco-bricks, eco-paving, eco-fashion and the like. As once noted by Anies Baswedan, the former governor of Jakarta, the terms ecology and economics can actually go hand in hand, because they have same prefix\u2014oikos, or household. While waste banks provide opportunity for waste valorisation, it is the Indonesian household where the initial sorting of waste has to take place. Given that women\u2019s main field of activity in Indonesia has historically been inside the house, this role is often fulfilled by the ibu rumah tangga (housewife). Though most prevalent within the waste bank family, these upcycling principles are being promoted across the wider society, including in formal schooling and rural development programs. There is a lot of enthusiasm around this plastic rush among certain segments of Indonesian society, especially the young. However, turning plastic waste into new and shiny products, such as the paving block seen above, is rarely done with the use of environmentally friendly and effective technologies. Instead, people rely on makeshift devices whereby plastic is melted into a tar that is then moulded into blocks. The heating process relies on the open burning of plastic waste\u2014a practice that takes no consideration for the emission of toxic gases and ash into the air and soil, respectively. Common in rural Indonesia where there is a limited access to basic waste collection services, open incineration of (mixed) wastes is a significant source of pollution. The open burning of plastics is particularly problematic as it is linked with an increased risk of cardiorespiratory and neurological disorders, as well as with toxic contamination of the soil and groundwater. The act of turning plastic waste into paving blocks produces adverse human health and environmental effects. However, these effects are rarely acknowledged by the advocates of these practices. Not all of the upcycling projects that are currently being propagated and practiced in Indonesia as part of the circular economy aspiration rely on the open incineration of plastics. One such example are grocery baskets and handbags that women and children in Indonesia are encouraged to make out of plastic sachets used previously as packaging for food, cosmetic, medicinal and toiletry products. From my observation, these and other upcycling projects often fail, or they end up serving different\u2014often symbolic\/ceremonial\u2014functions. In most cases, it is both the ecological and economic goals that are not realised. Being difficult to valorise, these products regularly end up being discarded. Because they are produced with mixed materials\u2014not only plastic waste, but also new materials, such as tapes, strings, wires, glue and the like\u2014they are unrecyclable. It could be said that making these products increases rather than reduces consumption and waste. In general, these entrepreneurial projects have the capacity to place responsibility for waste in the hands of consumers, rather than producers. This discursive endorsing of creativity has the potential to engender real effects, such as when certain practices and values regarding waste reduction (i.e. extended producer responsibility, and reductions in material throughput and consumption) are valued less than others. This alchemic-like ambition to turn discarded plastics into new objects can also be seen at the hands of government agencies. One such example, is the efforts of the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (MoPWH) to incorporate discarded single-use plastics into road tar for building national roads in the country. According to Danis Sumadilaga, the head of the Agency for Research and Development at the MoPWH, mixing plastic waste with asphalt will result in stronger and more stable roads. While it is certainly better to have wild plastic discards sequestered inside a road, rather than scattered in the environment or buried deep inside animals\u2019 entrails, this development undoubtedly erects a speed bump on the road towards the nationwide ban on single-use plastics. In other words, mixing single-use plastics with asphalt makes plastic appear as unproblematic. To return to the concept of Plasticene, the plastic road is representative of both the human alteration\u2014the plastification\u2014of the environment, and the blind assumption that the circular economy can coalesce economic growth with sustainability. I would urge policymakers in Indonesia to recognise and acknowledge that waste is indeed a serious problem. Reframing waste as only an economic resource does not convey the urgent need for waste management and waste reduction, nor does it call for greater responsibility among all segments of the populace. What the examples presented here show is that turning plastic discards into new products of economic value is anything but easy. Instead, such efforts often lead to pollution and obstruct meaningful actions aimed at waste prevention. Ensuring that all people have access to basic waste collection services, not only those living in urban areas, would be more effective in reducing waste pollution than encouraging groups and individuals to take advantage of the economic value of waste. This would require the modernisation of existing landfills\u2014the majority of which are mere open dumpsites\u2014and the development of new landfills in the country. This proposition might not be popular in the discourse on circular economy. However, without effective and integrated systems designed to capture and handle waste, waste will inevitably put more pressure on both people and the environment. Such developments should include efforts to incorporate informal waste workers into formal waste management systems. As the case with pemulung showed, policymakers in Indonesia need to take seriously the issue of social justice and equity in the circular economy-inspired transformations.","filter_flag":1}

Institutions represented were the University of Dayton, Cardinal Gibbons High School, Bishop O\u2019Dowd High School, the Garment Worker Center, and the Sweatfree Purchasing Consortium. The Industrial Commons is a cooperative ecosystem of businesses and organizations working to build a more just garment industry by centering workers\u2019 rights, living wages, and sustainability throughout the production process. These commitments have made them key CEPA partners as the Alliance provides support to institutions seeking to integrate the values of sustainability and workers\u2019 rights into their purchasing decisions. Throughout the immersion, participants had the opportunity to tour facilities and learn about the key partners in the ethical clothing manufacturing community. They began at Carolina Textile District, a member-governed and member-driven network of values-aligned textile manufacturers in North and South Carolina. Participants then toured Opportunity Threads, a worker-owned cooperative cut-sew factory primarily operated by migrants from Guatemala who now own and operate the facility within the cooperative model. The next tour was with Material Return, which works with local manufacturers and national brands to transform textile waste into new products. Material Return models a circular economy, which is an economic system based on the reuse and regeneration of materials or products, especially as a means of continuing production in a sustainable way. At Material Return, fabrics and threads that would have gone to waste are instead used to create new products such as beanies and socks. This model of circularity benefits the environment, local economies, workers, and values-aligned clients. After a full day of facility tours at The Industrial Commons in Morganton, participants traveled to Burlington, North Carolina, to a partner of the Carolina Textile District, TS Designs, a t-shirt manufacturing business focused on local sourcing, low carbon emissions, and corporate responsibility. Using the triple-bottom-line business model, which focuses on three equally important bottom lines: People, the Planet, and Profits, Eric Henry, founder and president of TS Designs, has crafted a t-shirt with full transparency from the growing of the cotton to the dyeing and printing process. He and his organization know who made it and the effect it has had on the planet in each step of the process. Apparel made from this transparent, ethical production process is already having an impact at CEPA-partnered schools. While at TS Designs, participants were looking through a box of t-shirts, and Sarah Richard, student engagement coordinator at the Hanley Sustainability Institute at University of Dayton, found a copy of the exact t-shirt she was wearing, which was made for her university by TS Designs. The immersion presented an opportunity for leaders in ethical purchasing and Catholic institutions to gather and learn more about the work of creating clothing and the ways in which individuals and institutions can make purchasing choices that align with protecting the rights and dignity of workers and the planet. When asked about the impact of the immersion overall, Richard reflected, \u201cI really enjoyed the opportunity to see firsthand an example of what\u2019s possible. In the classroom, we often talk about the issues in our supply chain and while we present the theory of change, to be able to meet the people waking up and doing this work every day, is quite inspiring.\u201d \u201cThe mini-immersion provided an opportunity for leaders in various institutions to come together and find ways to create a path for a more ethical purchasing model in their institutions,\u201d said Grace Adams, Catholic Ethical Purchasing Alliance coordinator. \u201cWe were lucky to have representatives from Catholic high schools, the University of Dayton\u2014our first CEPA university\u2014, and leaders within this work at the Garment Workers Center and the Sweatfree Purchasing Consortium present to learn about ways our institutions can honor the dignity of workers and the earth through purchasing policies and decisions.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR),\u200b which aims at reducing packaging pollution and building a circular economy for packaging, has an overall objective to ensure all packs are designed for recycling by January 1st, 2030, and recyclable five years later. Meanwhile, over in the UK there is a similar sustainable packaging initiative Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\u200b, which has been delayed but is still set to be in force in 2025. Under these regulations, the financial contribution will need to be paid by brands for packaging they put on the market to cover the cost of collecting, sorting, and recycling. While it appears that FMCG companies have been given plenty of time to prepare, the clock is ticking. Beauty consumers\u2019 appetite for new innovations and a constant flux of new and improved formulas are presenting a huge challenge when it comes to packaging sustainability. According to Gillian Garside-Wight, consulting director at packaging sustainability consultancy Aura, this accelerated speed to market and frequent product evolution are at odds with the core principles of sustainability, while \u2018luxury\u2019 beauty products with high-end packaging aren\u2019t helping redress the balance. However, she said there is much more cosmetics brands can do to minimise their impact on the environment and satisfy consumers. \u201cIt is about reinventing packaging and exploring new ways,\u201d \u200bshe said. \u201cThe whole industry is concerned and must work together to meet their engagements.\u201d\u200b Garside-Wight also said that in the UK, only 9% of cosmetics packaging is currently recycled and the rest is put into landfill. \u200b She points out that acknowledging the scale of the problem is the first step towards progress. Many brands have turned to refillable rather than single-use cosmetic packaging solutions, but this is not a simple switch and needs careful consideration of materials and data. There are also the potential health and safety issues that can arise if consumers are repeatedly refilling their own products at home, as recently noted by global packaging company Aptar\u200b at the Cosmetics 360 show. Garside-Wight said that beauty and personal care brands are missing a golden opportunity to educate consumers on their packaging sustainability goals. She noted how many focus on promoting cruelty-free, vegan-friendly, and responsibly sourced ingredients on the pack, but don\u2019t bother communicating their packaging sustainability goals in this same space. \u201cBrands such as Upcircle Beauty are doing it right when it comes to driving packaging sustainability, actively encouraging consumers to return packaging for refilling and providing a 20% discount on their products\u200b,\u201d she said. \u200b Garside-Wight also notes the need for data-driven decision-making to help achieve these ecological packaging goals: \u201cTo avoid greenwashing, brands must have access to accurate, real-time packaging data across the entire supply chain, taking into account factors like recyclability, recycled content, waste reduction and shelf life,\u201d \u200bshe shared. \u200b She continued: \u201cMisleading claims and the complexity of recyclability in different regions highlight the importance of thoughtful design based on factual, live and accurate information, not presumption.\u201d\u200b She concluded by saying that even though recycling rates have increased in Europe in the last years, the amount of waste generated is growing faster than the actual recycling. \u201cWithout action, the EU would see an increase of 19% in packaging waste by 2030,\u201d\u200b she said. The daily mission of our development teams \u200b While some beauty brands are still putting steps in place to start working on these targets, the packaging companies have needed to be ahead of the curve as their businesses depend on it. The VP for CSR and Product Sustainability at luxury packaging company Alb\u00e9a Cosmetics & Fragrance, Gilles Swyngedauw, said that Alb\u00e9a has been working on responsible packaging solutions for more than 15 years. \u201cWe are anticipating the new regulations, working with partners across the industry to establish common guidelines. Because in this long and complex journey, collaboration is key,\u201d\u200b he said. Swyngedauw shared that Alb\u00e9a is currently working on a big project with Citeo in France, to make skin care and makeup packaging designed for recycling into existing recycling streams and potential future streams. He also said that the company works with CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, Recyclass in EU and APR in the US to develop D4RG (Design for Recycling Guidelines) and a single definition of \u2018recyclability\u2019. It is also a member of SPICE, the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for Cosmetics, which was co-founded by L'Or\u00e9al and Quantis sustainable packaging consultancy and offers a specialist tool for businesses to use. \u201cLowering the impact of our solutions is therefore the daily mission of our development teams,\u201d\u200b shared Swyngedauw. \u201cAt Alb\u00e9a Cosmetics & Fragrance, reusing packaging is the most important issue and we are working on refillable jars, compacts or sticks. Reinventing packaging also means looking for more virtuous materials: a dedicated technical team is re-inventing ABS\/SAN packaging to move away from these non-recyclable resins.\u201d\u200b The company also has an Alb\u00e9a Tubes arm which is currently focusing on making the tubes recyclable. \u201cAt least 90% of the products in our portfolio have a recyclable solution and we are working on the remaining 10%. In addition to recyclability, the teams are also focusing on the reduction of material with lightweight solutions for sleeves and caps,\u201d \u200bshared Swyngedauw.\u200b He revealed that the integration of recycled content is also a key topic as the company is committed to incorporate 10% of PCR (Post-consumer recycled) in its solutions by 2025. Our message is \u2018not to panic\u2019\u200b Sustainability Champion at global cosmetics packaging company Quadpack Hulya Gray said that just like every other business in the industry, Quadpack is still working to gain clarity on the details of how to comply and integrate this in into its sustainability roadmap to transition and offer compliant products. As Quadpack is a B Corp, sustainability already underpins the business and Gray said that NPD now focuses on eco-design, mono-material packaging, refill formats and sustainable materials. \u201cWe are working to minimise the carbon footprint of our processes, by using renewable energy, regenerative systems and a biomass plant, \u200bshe said. \u201cWe are also trying to deliver solutions close to our customers, to produce or stock, decorate and assemble locally. So, we\u2019re already working towards a common goal.\u201d\u200b Gray also said that although Quadpack always encourages clients to select sustainable packaging for their products, it is still a tricky area to navigate. \u201cWe offer life-cycle assessments on the impact of our solutions to help them make informed choices, \u200bshe explained. \u201cHowever, in terms of compliance, our message is not to panic. There is a lot to figure out, but the important part is that we've started the journey to make sure we take care of the planet for future generations.\u201d\u200b","filter_flag":1}

Plus it\u2019s available for any company \u2013 regardless of their mobile provider. O2 Recycle has processed more than 3.8 million business and consumer devices since its launch in 2009, and last year paid out more than \u00a3670,000 to businesses. Devices are data wiped and 92% are either recycled or refurbished and resold as \u2018like new\u2019 products to customers \u2013 supporting the circular economy, with the remainder broken down for raw materials. None of the tech that goes through O2 Recycle ends up in a landfill. Jo Bertram, Managing Director at Virgin Media O2 Business, said: \u201cO2 Recycle for Business provides companies with a simple way to remove unused devices cluttering their offices \u2013 and be rewarded for it. \u201cOpen to businesses of all sizes whether a customer of ours or not, this initiative provides businesses with a responsible method to dispose of their e-waste, all while providing the trade-in value of the device or the opportunity to donate that to our charity partner, Good Things Foundation.\u201d Making recycling easier Thanks to enhancements to the O2 Recycle for Business platform, it\u2019s now easier than ever to recycle devices in just five simple steps \u2013 including registering multiple devices at once, and arrange a free courier collection to take the devices away. Recognising that a lot of employees now work remotely or in a hybrid pattern, businesses can now send them a QR code so they can post items to O2 Recycle for free, rather than having to take them into the office. Businesses can use their credit to buy new devices via O2 or donate up to 100% of their cash back to Virgin Media O2\u2019s charity partner, Good Things Foundation, to support digital inclusion projects across the UK. O2 Recycle for Business also supports organisations to lower their Scope 3 supply chain carbon emissions by ensuring that devices are more likely to be given a second life.

Circular Economy Monday There are lots of easy ways individuals can help advance the circular economy: Share - a circular economy supports the idea of access over ownership. Support the sharing economy by borrowing, renting, and sharing products. Repair - purchase items that can be dismantled for repair. Purchase repaired and refurbished electronics. Spend time finding repair manuals and learning how to DIY. Support local repair shops. Reuse - Find other purposes for items instead of throwing them in the garbage. Support reuse by participating in container reuse programs, choosing reusables over single-use products, and by swapping, reselling, or donating items you no longer need. Textiles Tuesday Did you know the average person throws away 37 kilograms (81 pounds) of textiles each year, and 95% of those clothes could be reused or recycled? In the last 15 years, clothing production has approximately doubled and less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing. The environmental impacts of clothing production are significant. The textiles industry relies mostly on non-renewable resources \u2013 98 million tonnes in total per year \u2013 including oil to produce synthetic fibres, fertilizers to grow cotton, and chemicals to produce, dye, and finish fibres and textiles. Plastics and textiles go hand-in-hand: every time we wash synthetic materials like polyester and nylon, tiny plastic fibres break off and up to 40% of these microfibres end of as ocean plastics. By only washing what really needs to be washed we can decrease the amount of microfibres entering our waterways and materials will last longer. Lower the negative environmental impacts of your clothing: Wear and use what you already own Repair or tailor your clothing as needed Reduce wear and tear by washing only when needed Purchase good-quality clothing and only what you need E-Waste Wednesday With such rapid advances in technology and endless new innovative products released every year, electronic waste (e-waste) is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world. The best way to reduce the impact that we have on the environment is to make sure that we use the gadgets that we already have in our pockets for as long as possible. E-waste includes unwanted electronic equipment such as smart devices and used cables. The parts that make up your electronics such as steel, glass, copper, aluminum, plastics and precious metals can be recovered and made into new products. When your electronic products are at their end of life, drop them off in the e-waste recycling bin at the Residential Drop Off at the Robin Hood Bay Waste Management Facility, open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday. Plastics Thursday Approximately 40% of the plastic produced each year is packaging that is used once and thrown away. An estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in our oceans each year - that\u2019s the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic every minute. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish, by weight. Everyone has a role to play to reduce plastic waste and to tackle plastic pollution: governments, companies, the recycling industry and individuals. The economic value of plastic lost to waste in Canada is $8 billion yearly and expected to increase to more than $11 billion by 2030. Make simple changes in your everyday life to reduce your plastic footprint, every action counts: Purchase products without plastic packaging, or purchase in bulk to reduce packaging Use reusable items instead of plastic disposal products, including water bottles Curbside recycle plastic containers that food, drink and cleaning supplies come in; recycling 1 tonne of plastics prevents up to 2 tonnes of carbon pollution. Food Waste Friday It\u2019s estimated the average Canadian household wastes $1,766 (in 2019) worth of food each year. Across Canada, 58% of all food produced is wasted - that's 35.5 million tonnes of food waste, 32% of which is still edible. This amounts to a staggering loss of $49.46 billion in value. And if that\u2019s not bad enough, Canada\u2019s food waste is equivalent to 56.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. When organic material is sent to landfill to decompose it releases methane into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is the single largest waste stream found in landfills. Take the food waste pledge and commit to: planning meals and making a grocery list storing fruits and vegetables properly so they last longer getting creative with leftovers thinking about expiry dates composting leftover organics When composted, food waste can turn into a valuable nutrient additive for soil. Consider backyard composting and learn more about the City of St. John\u2019s backyard compost program. Sharing Economy Saturday Access over ownership, and the sharing economy, are important pillars that contribute to a circular economy. Millions of Canadians engage in the sharing economy everyday - through ride sharing apps, libraries, rental services, online music\/video streaming and more - often not realizing their contribution to the circular economy. If you own a library card you are helping advance a circular economy! Swap and Repair Sunday Two very simple yet important pillars to the circular economy are swap and repair. The life of some everyday products can be extended with simple repairs or reinforcement. Donating unwanted items to reuse stores or community organizations keeps items out of landfill and in the hands of those who need them. In St. John\u2019s gently-used furniture and other household items can be shared for reuse in the community through several community organizations, including Home Again Furniture Bank and Habitat for Humanity ReStore. To divert useable furniture and household items from the landfill there is a Furniture ReUse bin in the Residential Drop Off at the Robin Hood Bay Waste Management Facility, open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday.

Polartec\u00ae Power Shield\u2122 and Power Stretch\u2122 Pro fabrics with Biolon\u2122 fibers and membranes will launch this fall. Both updated fabrics are recyclable. Biolon\u2122 is a renewable, non-GMO plant-based nylon with a 50 percent lower carbon footprint than nylon 6,6, the gold standard against which other nylons are measured. The properties of Biolon\u2122 nylon are closer to nylon 6.6 than many of the recycled nylon alternatives currently on the market. Biolon\u2122 has reworked a baseline standard and made the best even better in terms of performance and sustainability. Plant-based raw materials make up about half (45\u201348 percent) of the nylon content in the fibers and membranes of the new Polartec\u00ae Power Shield\u2122 and Power Stretch\u2122 Pro fabrics launching this fall. A fabric based on 100 percent Biolon\u2122 is expected to launch in 2024. \u201cSustainability is at the core of what we do at Polartec,\u201d commented Karen Beattie, Director of Product Management at Polartec. \u201cWe are elevating our sustainable material capabilities by exploring new fibers, adopting advanced manufacturing techniques, fostering innovation, and collaborating with partners. This comprehensive approach ensures that Polartec continues to lead in creating high-performance textiles that prioritize environmental responsibility and contribute to a more sustainable future.\u201d The innovation, which took two years to develop, is another success in Polartec\u2019s sustainability journey, which aims to increase the proportion of recycled and bio-derived materials across the Polartec range to reduce the brand\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels and reduce its carbon footprint. Several brands in the Outdoor and Cycling markets will launch new products with Biolon\u2122 fabrics this fall. Polartec\u00ae Power Shield\u2122 with Biolon\u2122 Biolon\u2122 plant-based nylon accounts for 48 percent content in the Polartec\u00ae Power Shield\u2122 membrane, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent compared to fossil fuel-based nylon. It has a water resistance rating of 20K mm (ISO 811) and a breathability rating of 20kg\/m2\/24 hours (JIS L1099, B1). New Power Shield fabrics debuting this fall will feature Biolon\u2122 nylon inputs in both the membrane and fabric components, elevating the overall plant-derived content per style while reducing the carbon footprint. Polartec Power Stretch\u2122 Pro with Biolon\u2122 This dual surface fabric comprises a highly durable nylon exterior and a soft, comfortable polyester interior. It is durable, comfortable and breathable, featuring 4-way stretch performance. Polartec\u2019s newest fabric release successfully replaces half of the fossil fuel-based nylon content with Biolon\u2122 plant-based nylon. The use of Biolon\u2122 plant-based nylon results in a 50 percent lower carbon footprint vs. virgin nylon while preserving all that is loved about this iconic fabric. \u201cWe at Polartec believe that leaving the world a better place than we found it is a responsibility for everyone,\u201d said Ramesh Kesh, Senior Vice President \u2013 Government & Defense and Polartec at Milliken & Company. \u201cThe launch of Biolon\u2122-based products marks an important step in that journey. For a long time, many thought sustainable options meant a loss in performance, like durability; Polartec has proved this is not the case. Challenging a technology already considered to be at the pinnacle of performance was a big ask, yet the team at Polartec rose to that challenge, and we believe we have created a new standard in sustainability for performance fabrics.\u201d More information about the new Polartec fabrics made with Biolon\u2122 is available here.","filter_flag":1}

NEW DELHI, Oct. 4, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ -- After being the first company in India to launch a one-litre bottle made from 100% recycled PET (rPET) for its packaged drinking water brand Kinley, Coca-Cola India is taking another meaningful step towards creating a circular economy and has announced the launch of Coca-Cola\u00ae in rPET in pack sizes of 250 ml and 750 ml. These rPET bottles are being manufactured by Coca-Cola bottling partners - Moon Beverages Ltd., and SLMG Beverages Ltd.. Coca-Cola India Launches 100% Recycled PET Bottles in the Carbonated Beverage Category Coca-Cola India Launches 100% Recycled PET Bottles in the Carbonated Beverage Category The rPET bottles expansion showcases Coca-Cola India's transformative journey towards building a sustainable and greener future for all. The bottles made from 100% food-grade rPET (excluding caps and labels) have an on-pack call to action \"Recycle Me Again\" message and will also drive consumer awareness with \"100% recycled PET bottle\" displayed on the pack. Sanjeev Agarwal, Chairman, Moon Beverages Limited (part of MMG Group), commended the rPET launch stating, \"PET plastic bottles have value beyond their first life. Our new bottles made with food-grade rPET are recyclable and can become another bottle giving it another life. Recycled PET is a big move in the right direction to embrace plastic circularity in India.\" These rPET bottles are crafted from food-grade recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The plastic is recycled as per the technologies approved by the US FDA and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for food-grade recycled material and repurposed into new PET bottles, reducing the need for virgin plastic for producing PET Bottles. On the launch of Coca-Cola\u00ae in rPET, Paritosh Ladhani, Managing Director, SLMG Beverages Limited stated, \"We produced the first bottle of Coca-Cola in India and are proud to be amongst the first bottlers to produce the rPET variant. We are committed to sustainability and SLMG is enthused to drive meaningful change and build a sustainable future.\" The Coca\u2013Cola Company now offers 100% rPET bottles in over 40 markets, bringing it closer to its World Without Waste goal of making bottles with 50% recycled content by 2030. Announced in 2018, the sustainable packaging platform also includes a goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of a bottle or can for every one the company sells globally by 2030, and to make 100% of its packaging recyclable by 2025. Enrique Ackermann, Vice President, Technical and Innovation, Coca-Cola India, and Southwest Asia, said, \" We seek to drive a circular economy for our packaging in order to reduce waste and carbon emissions. We're working to increase recycled content in our packaging, expand our use of refillable bottles, and to collect packaging for recycling through our World Without Waste initiative. We also do research for new solutions for packaging. This expansion by Moon Beverages and SLMG Beverages underscores Coca-Cola India's steadfast commitment to sustainability and its dedication to forging a more sustainable future.\" The Food Safety Authority of India (FSSAI) has approved the use of recycled PET in food packaging. Similarly, the Government of India's, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and the Bureau of Indian Standards has enabled befitting regulations and standards to facilitate the use of recycled plastics in food and beverage packaging. Coca-Cola is making it convenient for consumers to return their empty PET bottles by recycling them at conveniently placed drop-off points or Reverse Vending Machines (RVM's). Earlier this year, Coca-Cola India launched a 'Return and Recycle' initiative with Zepto that focuses on gathering PET bottles directly from consumers. This also helps in establishing an organized process of collecting PET bottles with 100% traceability. Specifically for India, Coca-Cola introduced ASSP (Affordable Small Sparkling Pack) for the 250 ml PET bottle. ASSP, a proprietary Coca-Cola innovative technology is used to reduce plastic usage in the production of PET bottles for sparkling products by up to 40 percent. In December 2022, Coca-Cola Bangladesh launched 100% rPET bottles, making it the first market in Southwest Asia (SWA) to introduce Kinley water bottles in one-liter packages.

The show also played host to some trailblazing expert speakers in its #Cleantech conferences, who raised important issues that should be considered to future-proof businesses. These included: 1. Refillable solutions are bringing new microbiological challenges\u200b Aptar has developed a new refill solution for face care and beauty products called GAIA and explained more about the tests it had undertaken for microbiome risk analysis of airless skincare packaging. As Patrick Bousquel, Marketing Director for at Aptar Beauty EMEA said \u201cNew product; new problems\u201d.\u200b And while refillable solutions are better for the planet, they bring along a whole new set of issues to consider when consumers are refilling products at home in a noncontrolled environment, such as the risks through cutaneous contacts during refills, and leakage due to lack of tightness in casing from repeated opening and closing. Aptar said it had worked with various external partners such as consultants and laboratories to test the microbiological safety of this new packaging solution. Florence Roullet, Aptar\u2019s Applied Sciences Director GMI Beauty & Home detailed the various tests the company had undertaken to ensure the new product was fit for purpose, including one test with a \u201cone minute exposure to ambient air\u201d\u200b (with an assumption this would be at 500 CFUm\/3), along with in vitro \u200btests to investigate contamination levels, with a test strain of Staphylococcus epidermis. It also tested out container tightness to prevent leakage by comparing GAIA to a similar Aptar product that isn\u2019t refillable. 2. There is still an unmet demand for sustainable packaging\u200b According to Euromonitor\u2019s Project Manager for Sustainability Maria Bogdanova, the company's consumer data showed that \u2018Recyclable\u2019 is the most trusted green label among consumers. With 58% of those quizzed saying this. It was closely followed by 56% who said locally sourced; 53% who said natural; 53% also said organic; 52% who said eco-friendly and 49% sustainably produced. Bogdanova shared that \u2018fighting plastic\u2019 and \u2018recycling\u2019 were consumers' top priorities and that 64% said they tried to \u2018have an impact on the environment through their actions.\u2019 She explained that there is still an unmet demand for sustainable packaging. The US, France and UK were the top three countries that had released the most beauty and personal care products with sustainable packaging, but there are huge opportunities for investment within this area in Brazil and Mexico, as there is a high consumer demand but a lack of innovation in this area. Euromonitor\u2019s consumer data also showed that people were often confused by sustainability messaging and said they wanted simple and reliable messages on sustainability, which was backed up by certifications and studies. Bogdanova also pointed out that packaging was the most obvious tool to clearly and simply communicate sustainability credentials. 3. We are focusing on land and forgetting the ocean\u200b According to Vincent Duret from ocean protection company Fondation de la Mer, the ocean is in a state of emergency, yet much of the innovation and work we are doing is focused on assessing the impact on biodiversity on the land and not in the sea. He said that use of bio-sourced maritime-origin ingredients in cosmetics is increasing and that going forward, packaging will be a key way to communicate eco-responsibility for this. The company offers beauty and personal care companies two tools to assess their impact on the marine environment: The Ocean Framework: a reference framework that takes into account a company\u2019s impact on the ocean and integration of ocean protection into its strategy; as well as the Ocean-Approved label for companies that have met the framework\u2019s criteria. 4. Use of PFAS in sunscreen is likely to become more regulated\u200b According to Frank Gana founder of (Re)set, a company that has worked with businesses like Chanel, LVMH and L\u2019Or\u00e9al to help them make their businesses more sustainable, the industry is currently facing resources issue in terms of biodiversity, water and use of carbon. Gana stated that while natural ingredients are popular with consumers, nature has limited resources. He said that between 2015 and 2020, the planet experienced 10m hectares of deforestation per year in overexploitation of natural resources. He highlighted the fact that PFAS in sunscreen will be the next topic to be put under the microscope and suggested that Lignin may be a potential alternative, but remarked that it\u2019s very difficult to stabilise it. 5. Addressing water use should be high on the R&D agenda\u200b Gana also advised companies on water consumption to create products. \u201cWater use is starting to be regulated even though it\u2019s required at several stages when making cosmetics, \u200bhe said. \"Companies must reduce water consumption at each stage of the product life cycle, check wastewater quality, and innovate to develop new products in this space\u201d\u200b Overall, Gana\u2019s advice for beauty and personal care companies was to: \u201cLook beyond packaging and create formulations that reduce water use and help biodiversity.\u201d\u200b 6. Joint packaging solutions from industry giants are expected by late 2024\u200b The #CleanTech conferences also revealed that 'co-operation is the new competition' and that many competing companies like L\u2019Or\u00e9al, LVMH, Chanel, J&J and Shiseido have all worked together with RE(SET) on its \u2018Pulp in Action\u2019 program, which is aims to replace use of plastic in cosmetics packaging with cellulosic fibre. The first complete solutions are expected to be unveiled by the end of 2024, with 60 innovations selected and 45 pilots launched. 7. L\u2019Or\u00e9al has some ambitious targets to meet by 2030\u200b By 2030, the French multinational is aiming to ensure that 95% of its ingredients in formulations will be bio-based and derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes, and that 100% of the plastics used in its products\u2019 packaging will be either from recycled or bio-based sources. Speaking at a roundtable about circular economy to replace petro-sourced chemistry, Olivier Rolland, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Global Director R&I for the future and green strategy, shared that the company is now aiming for \u201c100% eco-conception for all our products\u201d. \u200bHe also said: \u201cWe need to think about the whole value chain; innovations are only solving one problem.\u201d \u200b","filter_flag":1}

This facility \u2013 which Terrapure says is the largest of its kind in Canada \u2013 allows the company to further its contribution to the circularity of the economy in Quebec and Canada by recycling plastic battery casings for reuse in the creation of new products. \"The opening of this facility is a significant milestone for our company, one that demonstrates not only our commitment to protecting the environment but also to growing our operations in Quebec,\" said Ryan Reid, president and CEO of Terrapure. \"By adding plastic recycling to our well-established lead battery recycling capabilities, we are able to further close the recycling loop for our battery manufacturing customers.\" The recycling process, which includes washing and shredding the polypropylene chips from used battery casings, followed by extrusion of the chips to create plastic pellets approximately three millimetres in diameter, is completed entirely at Terrapure's Ville de Sainte-Catherine location. Terrapure invested close to $30 million to develop the new facility, which currently operates 5 days per week, 16 hours per day, and employs around 15 full-time employees. The pellets are shipped throughout North America by truck or rail to produce new products, including new battery casings. Terrapure can produce approximately 10,000 tonnes of recycled polypropylene pellets annually. Given that lead batteries typically contain four to five percent plastic by weight, this additional recycling opportunity further strengthens the circular economy for batteries. Terrapure provides a vital service that not only recovers value from what would otherwise be a hazardous waste that would be disposed of but also helps conserve natural resources and protect the environment. Lead batteries, which are essential to the green energy transition, are the most recycled consumer and industrial product in North America \u2013 about 99 percent of batteries are recovered and recycled, far more than any other product \u2013 and the components can be reused infinitely. Additionally, recycling plastic battery casings for reuse generates between 57 and 66 percent fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at Terrapure's facilities than the process of producing plastic from conventional manufacturing, according to recent GHG assessments. Terrapure recovers over 90 percent of the constituent components in batteries. Each year at its Ville de Ste-Catherine facility and another facility in Mississauga, Ont., the company recycles 12 million spent batteries and has the ability to recover up to 134,000 tonnes of lead and 15,000 tonnes of polypropylene pellets to be reused in the manufacturing of new batteries. The company employs 40+ highly skilled employees between its two plants, including 220+ in Quebec.","filter_flag":1}

Grown out of what was once a car park, Collective Retreats feels like a real escape from the city while sitting just an eight-minute ferry ride away. Grown out of what was once a car park, Collective Retreats feels like a real escape from the city while sitting just an eight-minute ferry ride away. Grown out of what was once a car park, Collective Retreats feels like a real escape from the city while sitting just an eight-minute ferry ride away. Just a short ferry ride from Lower Manhattan lies a car-free island that offers a slice of rural escapism in full view of the city. This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK). The passengers who spill off the boat at Governors Island ferry terminal are already in holiday mode. In the eight minutes it\u2019s taken to make the crossing from Manhattan, any daily preoccupations have been cast off. Sunglasses on, day bags slung over shoulders, they consult the map on the information board and then go their separate ways. Some make straight for the Mexican restaurant just 50ft away, aiming to do nothing but sit in the sunshine with cold beers and tacos. Others rent bright-red bikes, setting off on a leisurely circumnavigation of the car-free island, their baskets full of picnic supplies. A few pad up to QY NC Spa, ready to get into white dressing gowns and slowly rotate through its relaxation rooms, saunas and pools. The spa\u2019s location, in a former army barracks, gives a clue to the island\u2019s former life. The 172-acre site was used as a US military base for over 200 years and much remains from that time. There are canary-yellow cottages, once used by soldiers and their families; a grand colonnaded Admiral\u2019s House, befitting its commanding officer; and a clapboard chapel and red-brick theatre that served all. The outdoor decks offer unparalleled views of the Manhattan skyline to one side and the Statue of Liberty to the other. Photograph by Matt Dutile A 2003 ban against permanent residency on Governors Island, part of which is a National Monument, means that many of the buildings stand empty and dilapidated. Their future is, however, in safe hands. Run by a trust whose focus is on public art projects, sustainability and low-key hospitality, the island has been given a fresh lease of life in recent years. Among its new tenants are the Billion Oyster Project, which aims to restore the oyster reefs around New York Harbor, and Circular Economy Manufacturing, which uses solar power to turn the city\u2019s plastic waste into new products such as planters and lighting. One of the first arrivals was Collective Retreats. On a former car park on the western edge of the island sits a collection of glamping accommodation, from canvas safari tents with shared bathrooms to an extraordinary, wood-framed villa with hanging fireplace and walk-in shower. No matter which option guests choose, they\u2019ll likely spend most of their time on the outdoor decks, unable to quite break away from the views of the Manhattan skyline to one side and the Statue of Liberty to the other. It\u2019s hard to process that the Collective Retreats site is less than a mile from the most densely populated patch of land in the entire US. The occasional toot from the Staten Island Ferry or calls from barn swallows, warblers and herring gulls provide the soundtrack here. The breeze carries the scent of salt, not fumes. And the main distractions are a game of baseball or giant Jenga on the clover-pocked lawn. Come nightfall, when the day visitors have taken the last ferry home and the only people left on the island are those staying at Collective Retreats, the sense of quiet seclusion deepens. General manager Paige Carter, in black jeans and a baseball cap, has worked here for over a year and is still in a state of palpable wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy we\u2019re only a few minutes from the city,\u201d she says, gazing over the water as the sky turns pink and amber in the setting sun. \u201cIt feels like you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be here.\u201d A sunset cocktail hour brings guests together to chat and share stories, while dinner is served from an open kitchen. Photograph by Matt Dutile Paige explains that 70% of people who stay are New Yorkers, many returning year after year for an easy-to-access hit of escapism. \u201cThey come for the night and commute into the city first thing,\u201d she says. And while the setting that draws them is rustic, the service is not. A sunset cocktail hour brings guests together to chat and share stories, while dinner, served from an open kitchen on a decked terrace, might include compressed watermelon salad or grilled langoustine fettuccine. Diners continually pause to take in the showboating spectacle around them, the skyscrapers of Manhattan ablaze with lights and Lady Liberty\u2019s torch glowing steadily in the thickening darkness. But it\u2019s the simple pleasures that win out at night here: s\u2019mores cooked on the campfire; fireflies flickering their amorous intentions in the long grass; and a universe of stars slowly revealing itself above. Safari tent from $203 (\u00a3163). This story was created with the support of Collective Retreats.","filter_flag":1}

E-waste is an electronic product that is no longer needed, worn out, not working, or nearing the end of its utility for the user. These include wires to devices.\"While e-waste is a growing environmental issue, this is an opportunity for manufacturers, customers and general public to come together and address the issue.

Our 2030 circular economy goals span the full lifecycle of our products -- from design through manufacturing, shipping and recovery.\"Consumers play an important role by returning old electronics, and Dell offers a variety of options to conveniently return and recycle end-of-life technology and support e-waste reduction,\" Abbatiello added.\"By 2025-26, we will have enabled the recycling and reuse of 800 million pounds (362,874 MT) of end-of-life products (cumulative since 2005)... while 84 per cent of repairs can be done at the customer site, without having to send their PC to a service centre,\" Lenovo said.About 76 per cent of repairable PC parts returned to each service centre will be repaired for future use by 2025-26, it said.In India, nearly 300 Lenovo products include content from recycled electronics, the company added.","filter_flag":1}

Credit: Shutterstock Using consumer surveys and data from the Office of National Statistics, Barclaycard and Development Economics say resale and renting, or what they call the recommerce economy, has become more popular in the last 12 months. UK consumers now spend around \u00a35.92bn on second hand products and \u00a31.07bn on renting items. The report says that Gen Z consumers are driving the trend, with two thirds of consumers in this age bracket preferring second hand to new items. Younger Millennials, aged 25-34, are the next largest Recommerce consumers, spending an estimated \u00a31.95bn on second hand items in the last 12 months. Overall, 44% of consumers say they are buying more second hand items than they did a year ago. \u201cRecommerce\u201d includes products bought or rented that have previously been owned. The most popular items to buy and sell in this way include clothing, particularly designer goods, homeware and children\u2019s toys. Clothing and accessories accounts for 17.3% of the recommerce economy \u2013 an estimated \u00a31.22bn \u2013 and second only to cars and vehicles. How well do you really know your competitors?

UK consumers are making an average of \u00a325 a month by selling unwanted items though online marketplaces or in-person such as at garage sales or boot sales. The cost of living is a driving factor for the change, with 62% of UK consumers saying that this is making them think more carefully about purchases. 44% say that concerns about sustainability are what made them switch, while 22% say that buying second hand allows them to access designer items that would otherwise be out of reach. In 2022, a GlobalData report showed that the resale apparel market had \u201csoared\u201d between 2016 and 2021. Despite this, GlobalData\u2019s filings data shows that the word \u201cresale\u201d has not been mentioned as frequently in apparel company filings so far this year. This comes after steady growth in mentions of the term since 2019. Mentions of \u2018resale\u2019 in apparel company filings 2018-2023 Credit: GlobalData In 2018, the term was mentioned in just 18 apparel company filings but this massively increased to 95 times in 2019. In the following years the number of mentions increased steadily, until \u201cresale\u201d was mentioned in 116 apparel company reports in 2022. So far in 2023, \u201cresale\u201d has only been mentioned in 72 apparel company filings. In September, GlobalData figures showed that \u201ccircular economy\u201d mentions in apparel company filings increased from 1,048 in 2018 to 2,040 in 2022. Linda Weston, managing director at Barclaycard Payments, says: \u201cThe rising cost-of-living and a shift towards more sustainable habits are changing the way Brits shop. Our data shows we\u2019re increasingly opting to shop second hand, or rent items for a short period of time, rather than buying outright. The trend is permeating a range of sectors, from childcare to pet care and from fashion to fitness.\u201d \u201cThis demonstrates an exciting opportunity for the UK economy, as well as retailers, with more than a third of Brits saying they plan to embrace more sustainable shopping practices in the years ahead. In order to capitalise on this trend, businesses should think about how they adapt to provide consumers with a range of more sustainable and affordable ways to shop in the future.\u201d Steve Lucas, economic development manager at Development Economics, adds: \u201cUK consumers are increasingly recognising the value-for-money and sustainability benefits of renting or buying the items they need second hand. The Recommerce Economy is therefore already creating important economic influences across the UK, and these effects will continue to grow as more consumers recognise the benefits and extend their use of renting and second hand to a wider set of products.\u201d \u201cThe market is supporting a significant number of retail sector jobs across the UK, and this proportion is set to show strong growth over the next few years.\u201d Our signals coverage is powered by GlobalData\u2019s Thematic Engine, which tags millions of data items across six alternative datasets \u2014 patents, jobs, deals, company filings, social media mentions and news \u2014 to themes, sectors and companies. These signals enhance our predictive capabilities, helping us to identify the most disruptive threats across each of the sectors we cover and the companies best placed to succeed.","filter_flag":1}

We must design for a more circular economy, writes CHRIS BUCHANAN, client solutions director of Dell Technologies South Africa. I\u2019m always surprised by the statistics about electronic waste (e-waste) and how little is understood about this critical environmental issue. A recent study of Gen Z and Millennials found 60% of adults don\u2019t know what e-waste is, and 57% didn\u2019t realise these items contribute to pollution. E-waste is anything with a plug, battery or cable \u2013 electronics that have reached the end of their useful lives. Every year we recognise International E-Waste Day on 14 October, an annual campaign to raise awareness about the growing problem of e-waste and promote responsible e-waste management. We often talk about environmental issues associated with this growing waste stream, but when I think about e-waste, I see opportunity. As product design engineers, my team makes our technology more sustainable by incorporating materials with reduced carbon emissions. This could be a sustainable material like recycled carbon fibre or one produced with renewable energy like our hydropower aluminium. At Dell, a lot of thought and research goes into the materials we choose and the processes we use to manufacture them. To help stem the flow of e-waste, we go \u2018back to the future\u2019 and strive to design to extend product life and more easily access components for recyclability. Chris Buchanan, client solutions director of Dell Technologies South Africa. Our Commitment to Circularity At Dell, we are committed to keep materials in use longer, and our 2030 goals span the full lifecycle of our products \u2013 from design through manufacturing, shipping and recovery: \u00b7 For every metric ton of our product customers buy, we will reuse or recycle one metric ton. \u00b7 We will make 100% of our packaging from recycled or renewable material or will utilise reused packaging. \u00b7 We will make more than half of our product content from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon emissions material. Designing for the End from the Start When we design products, we must design for circularity. Driving a circular economy will directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing new materials. We work to incorporate more sustainable materials into our technology, but we also optimise the materials we use. We reduce the number of materials wherever possible and make sure we don\u2019t use anything that is not absolutely necessary or that makes the device difficult to recycle at end\u2013of\u2013life. And we design our products to ensure materials are more easily harvested for reuse and recycling. The Opportunity in E-Waste Our recovery and recycling services support e-waste reduction and also provide a valuable stream of materials that can be repurposed or recycled for use in new products. Since 2007, Dell has recovered more than 1.1-billion kilograms of used electronics. If a product reaches end-of-life and repair or reuse is not possible, we employ closed-loop strategies, where applicable, to create new products by recycling select materials from out-of-use technology. In 2014, we pioneered the use of closed-loop plastics from recovered technology, and we also use closed-loop rare earth magnets and aluminium. Bottom line \u2013 to meet our goals and increase sustainable and recycled materials in our technology, we need more products returned so we can harvest more materials. We can all help by emptying our closets and cabinets and returning old electronics. Dell makes it convenient and secure to return and recycle end-of-life electronics and accessories. In addition to reducing e-waste, you are also extending the life of materials that can be scaled into new products. We have made good progress, but still have a lot of work ahead to achieve our goals, and it will take all of us working together to drive a more circular economy.

Annual stylistic tweaks have driven unnecessary upgrades to cars since the concept was introduced by General Motors in 1923. The emergence of pre-packaged food and disposable drinks bottles in the mid-20th century enabled people to buy instead of make, replace instead of repair, and reclassify objects and materials as waste, rather than holding on to them as resources. This made ordinary people feel rich, fuelling an insatiable desire for the new. There has already been a real shift towards designers using waste or \"second-life\" materials In her 1999 book Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash, Susan Strasser coined the term \"the veneration of newness\". It is a phenomenon that emerged in 1950s America, ushering in the throwaway culture that came to define the second half of the 20th century and continues today with fast fashion, fast furniture and even fast tech. It's time for change. The design industry needs to let go of its obsession with the new and instead start venerating the patina of age, and lead the transition to a circular economy. The second tenet of the circular economy, as defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, is to \"keep materials and objects in use\". There has already been a real shift towards designers using waste or \"second-life\" materials and talk of \"design for disassembly\". We've started to get our heads around the idea of keeping materials in use, but what about the objects themselves? Fashion might have led the design industry towards \"fast furniture\", but it's also leading the way back towards repair. British brand Toast now employs as many repair specialists as it does designers, and not only offers clothes-swapping events and repair services, but also Toast Renewed \u2013 a collection of repaired clothes and home accessories. The pieces cost more than their original RRP, adding value to stock that would have once been destined for outlet stores and demonstrating a business model for repair. \"As a matter of integrity, brands have a responsibility to incorporate repair, rental or resale into their business models,\" said Toast's Madeleine Michell. \"These steps come with challenges, but they are essential for a transition towards a more circular system.\" We need to start questioning whether new products and furniture are always the answer Raeburn is another fashion brand built on circular principles. It was launched in 2009 with a collection of eight garments made from a single pilot's parachute and has continued the themes of reuse and repair to this day. \"It's apparent that repair and mending is becoming part of the mainstream again,\" founder Christopher Raeburn told me. \"I'd like to think that the future will see repair celebrated as it used to be, but it's also important that this comes in tandem with better product design.\" A handful of product and furniture brands are starting to take note. TAKT launched Spoke (pictured), a sofa that is designed for repair, during Copenhagen's 3 Days of Design in June. \"The change we need is to design products that have exposed, visible fixings that can be operated with simple, accessible tools \u2013 if tools are required at all,\" said its designer T\u00f8rbjorn Anderssen. \"We need to ensure that recyclable mono-materials are used wherever possible and we need to provide customers with spare parts that extend the life of products.\" If design is about solving problems, perhaps we need to start questioning whether new products and furniture are always the answer. \"We don't make lights, we find them\" is the strapline of Skinflint \u2013 a certified B Corp that has saved more than 50,000 vintage lights from landfill. The brand salvages lamps from the 1920s to the 1970s, restores them to modern safety standards and then offers a lifetime guarantee, repair service and buy-back scheme. \"We've demonstrated that a fully circular approach to lighting is absolutely possible,\" said founder Chris Miller. \"And we hope that other leaders in the industry will follow suit, bringing change to the sector as a whole.\" If we can stop asking \"what's new?\" and instead celebrate what isn't, perhaps we can let go of a 20th-century model that is no longer serving us, and lead the way in the transition to a circular economy.

At Aldi, customers will be encouraged to send back their empty medicine packets using a free postal service. These packets are not typically recycled in traditional processing plants as their multi-material nature \u2013 they usually include metal and plastics \u2013 makes them challenging to recycle. The posted packaging will be managed by TerraCycle. Recycled metal will be used to make nuts and bolts. Plastics, meanwhile, will be used to create durable items like waste bins or outdoor furniture. Freepost envelopes can be claimed via the Aldi website in the UK. Customers will be limited to two envelopes per month. \u201cBlister packs are a product that cannot currently be recycled at the kerbside and are instead disposed of in general waste, so we fully support this trial,\u201d said WRAP\u2019s senior specialist Adam Herriott. \u201cBeing able to recycle this type of packaging into raw material, which can then be used for new products, is something we and our UK Plastics Pact members are working hard to achieve on a range of difficult-to-recycle plastics. We look forward to seeing the results of the trial.\u201d Aldi has already added collection points for soft and flexible plastics, which most UK councils do not collect from homes, to dozens of its British stores. In tandem with scaling recycling offerings, the retailer is aiming to halve the volume of plastic packaging it uses on own-brand products in the UK and Ireland by 2025, against a 2019 baseline. Refill revolution In related news, the \u2018Reposit\u2019 packaging refill scheme spearheaded by Beauty Kitchen has launched a new project aimed at enabling shoppers to buy products in pre-filled packaging in one place, then deposit the empty packaging for return in a different place if needed. It has secured the support of M&S to do so, with the supermarket trialling the model with a range of eight homecare products across six stores. Products have been from the Ecover brand as well as Beauty Kitchen. Now, the team behind Reposit have announced an ambition to scale the model to 100 products across 200 stores before the end of June 2024. Additional brands and retailers are being asked to register their interest by 30 October. Reposit founder and director Stuart Chidley said collaboration is essential to \u201cremove the barriers\u201d to creating \u201ca commercially, operationally and environmentally scalable reuse platform\u201d. Ecover and Beauty Kitchen have already worked to prepare for an expansion through their own platforms and through selected stockists\u2019 stores and websites. UK Research & Innovation\u2019s (UKRI) Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging Fund is financially supporting Reposit and environmental not-for-profit City to Sea is providing practical support including insight from consumer research. City to Sea\u2019s head of development Jane Martin said the scheme will be \u201cgame-changing\u201d. She said: \u201cThis means that customers will be able to easily and accessibly pick up their favourite products in packaging that has already been refilled safe in the knowledge that it will be used again and again driving a circular economy.\u201d The Ellen MacArthur Foundation revealed in 2020 that just 2% of the products sold by the world\u2019s biggest consumer goods firms are housed in reusable packaging.","filter_flag":1}

The rapid urbanisation and growing population, coupled with a high demand for e-products, make the country more susceptible to the adverse impacts of e-waste, writes Md Zahurul Al Mamun IN OUR technology-driven world, electronic devices have become ubiquitous, driven by technological advancements, rising incomes and global accessibility. Innovation and trade have made electronics affordable and accessible in every corner of the planet. However, this convenience comes at a cost \u2014 electronic waste or e-waste. The exponential growth of e-waste generation globally is driven by rapid technological advancements, planned obsolescence, lack of repairability and reusability options and the insatiable demand for the latest gadgets. According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2020, the world produced 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste in 2019, equivalent to the weight of 7,300 Eiffel Towers. It also predicts that the global e-waste generation will reach 74.7 million tonnes by 2030 and about 120 million tonnes by 2050, making it the fastest-growing waste stream globally. Bangladesh is not immune to the problem of e-waste. According to a study by the Department of Environment, Centre for Environmental and Resource Management and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh generates about 2.7 million tonnes of e-waste annually, which is expected to double by 2030. The rapid urbanisation and growing population, coupled with a high demand for e-products, make the country more susceptible to the adverse impacts of e-waste. On International E-Waste Day today, let\u2019s delve into this issue, explore its multifaceted impacts and discuss potential solutions. What is e-waste? ELECTRONIC waste or e-waste is the term that refers to any electrical or electronic devices that have been discarded as waste without any intention of reusing them, are unwanted by their owner or have reached the end of their useful life or become obsolete. E-waste covers a wide range of discarded electronic devices and gadgets, such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, refrigerators, air conditioners, fluorescent lamps, batteries and more. These devices contain valuable materials, including rare earth materials, gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium, lithium, ceramic, metals, plastics and glass. However, the current linear model for production and consumption contributes to the growing e-waste problem. Most e-products are not designed to last long or to be repaired easily, and they are becoming more complex and challenging to repair. At the same time, products have also become cheaper, making it attractive for consumers to buy new and discard used ones. All these factors combined lead to more e-waste. The Global E-waste Monitor 2020 report shows that only 17.4 per cent of the e-waste generated in 2019 was collected and recycled properly, while the rest was either dumped in landfills or burned in informal settings. Hidden threat of e-waste On environment: E-waste poses a severe threat to environmental and human health due to the presence of toxic and hazardous materials and improper disposal practices. E-waste contains not only valuable materials but also hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc, yttrium, chromium, beryllium, nickel, arsenic, antimony trioxide, tin, polyvinyl chloride, Halogenated and brominated flame retardants. Toxic chemicals can leach into the soil and affect its quality and fertility when e-waste is dumped in landfills to decay. This can make the soil less suitable for growing plants and crops, polluting the entire value chain and reducing the biodiversity of soil organisms, like bacteria, fungi and worms, crucial for nutrient cycling and decomposition. According to a report by UNEP, e-waste is responsible for 70 per cent of the toxic chemicals found in landfills, which can contaminate the soil and groundwater and threaten food security and livelihoods. Water pollution is another major issue caused by e-waste. When e-waste is exposed to rain or floods, it can release toxic substances such as heavy metals, organic pollutants and pathogens into surface and groundwater sources, reducing water quality and availability for drinking, irrigation, and supporting aquatic life. This pollution can also increase freshwater scarcity and the risk of waterborne diseases. Lastly, air pollution is another significant concern from e-waste. Burning or incinerating e-waste releases toxic and harmful gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Burning e-waste can produce ground-level ozone. This occurs when volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans react with sunlight, causing acid rain and smog. Handling and inhaling toxic substances from e-waste can pose significant health risks and increase mortality. On humans: E-waste is a serious health problem affecting millions worldwide due to its toxic substances. The World Health Organisation has estimated that exposure to e-waste can result in a multitude of health problems, including respiratory infections, skin diseases, eye irritation, headaches, nausea, fatigue, an increased risk of cancer and neurological disorders. These health risks are particularly pronounced for informal workers who handle e-waste without proper equipment, training and protection and use primitive methods like breaking or burning to extract valuable materials. These workers often work in dangerous conditions and are exposed to dangerous chemicals, heavy metals and toxic air to retrieve precious metals to support their families. Children and pregnant women working in this sector are especially more vulnerable to the effects of e-waste exposure, which can impair their growth development cognitive abilities. On climate change: Electronic waste is a significant environmental issue that has far-reaching implications for climate change. E-waste releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons when burned or dumped in landfills. These emissions contribute to the increasing frequency of natural disasters and heat waves. E-waste plays a vital role in GHG emissions during production, use and disposal. E-products require considerable energy and resources to extract and process raw materials. This generates CO2 and other GHG emissions during production. For instance, one laptop emits over 220 kilogram of carbon dioxide during manufacturing. Additionally, e-products consume electricity to run, which also generates emissions depending on the energy source. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the global electricity consumption of information and communication technologies was 1,100 terawatt-hours in 2018, accounting for about 3.7 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Finally, the disposal of e-waste can release GHG when burned or dumped in landfills. In 2019, e-waste contributed to a global carbon footprint of 98 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents, similar to Belgium\u2019s annual emissions, according to the Global E-waste Monitor 2020 report. Resource depletion: E-waste is a goldmine of secondary raw materials, including precious metals like gold, copper, nickel and rare materials like indium and palladium, which have strategic value. These materials can be repurposed and recycled to create new products, reducing the need for mining, saving energy and water, and generating income and employment. A 2016 study by the United Nations University estimated that e-waste contained 7.7 per cent of the global gold supply, equivalent to 112.3 tonnes of gold. However, improper e-waste disposal leads to the loss of valuable materials and increased environmental and social problems. Wasting these resources also increases the demand for raw material extraction and production, which can negatively impact deforestation, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and human rights violations. Challenges in e-waste landscape BANGLADESH is grappling with a surge in e-waste generation due to population growth, urbanisation, consumer behaviour, freelancing and internet access. Despite various policies and regulatory frameworks introduced to manage this issue, a comprehensive and integrated approach to the e-waste situation is lacking. Inadequate infrastructure, lack of effective multi-stakeholder engagement and insufficient investment make it even more difficult. Regulatory shortcomings: The current law on e-waste management, the Hazardous Waste (e-waste) Management Rules 2021 under the Bangladesh Environmental Protection Act, 1995, is inadequate and poorly enforced. It does not cover all aspects of e-waste management. They lack specific methods and standards for e-waste collection, transportation, storage, recycling and disposal. It also does not define the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, such as government agencies, producers, importers, retailers, collectors, recyclers and consumers. There is also a lack of coordination among different stakeholders and a lack of transparency and accountability in the system, which could lead to inconsistency, inefficiency and non-compliance among stakeholders involved in e-waste management. Lack of producer responsibility: The producers, assemblers, importers or exporters of e-products have no incentives or mechanisms to adopt eco-design principles or extended producer responsibility schemes in Bangladesh. Extended producer responsibility is a policy approach that requires producers to take responsibility for their products at end-of-life by paying for the collection or treatment of their products or providing information or guidance to consumers on how to dispose of them. Extended producer responsibility also encourages producers to design more durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable products. However, producer responsibility is virtually non-existent in Bangladesh. Producers, assemblers, importers or exporters face no consequences or rewards for their products at end-of-life. They have no obligation to pay for the collection or treatment of their products, provide information or guidance to consumers on how to dispose of them or design durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable products. Inadequate recycling facilities: Bangladesh also faces a significant challenge in managing e-waste due to the lack of adequate facilities for collecting, transporting, storing, treating and recycling it. There are no set standards or criteria for e-waste recycling or disposal facilities. Most of the existing facilities are informal and unregulated. Furthermore, there are no specific requirements or guidelines on how these facilities should operate, what technologies they should use, what outputs they should produce or what emissions they should control. This lack of proper safety measures or waste management practices increases the risk of pollution and accidents, further compounding the problem. Informal e-waste sector: The informal e-waste management sector in Bangladesh is a significant challenge for environmental and social sustainability. This sector handles about 80 per cent of the e-waste generated in the country but operates without legal recognition or regulation. The informal workers, mostly poor and uneducated, collect, dismantle, repair, refurbish or trade e-waste using primitive methods and tools. They are unaware of the health and environmental risks posed by the toxic and hazardous materials present in e-waste. They also lack proper equipment, training or protection to handle e-waste safely and efficiently. As a result, they expose themselves and their communities to various diseases and injuries and pollute the soil, water, and air with e-waste contaminants. Consumer engagement: Consumers or end-users of e-products play a vital role in e-waste management, but they are often neglected or uninformed. According to current rules and regulations, consumers should return their discarded or unused products to authorised traders, sellers or collection centres, but they are not given any guidance, education or motivation. Consumers also have no economic incentive to recycle their e-waste, as they do not receive any compensation or reward for their participation. Many consumers are unaware of the environmental and health impacts of e-waste and the benefits of recycling. They also lack information on how and where to dispose of their e-waste properly. They often throw away their e-waste with other household waste or sell it to informal collectors without realising they are contributing to environmental pollution and health hazards. What can be done? A data-driven roadmap: Bangladesh must adopt a data-driven approach to tackle the growing e-waste problem and avoid future catastrophes. This approach should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the country\u2019s current and projected e-waste generation and management, aligning with international standards and best practices. A national inventory and database should be established to track e-waste generation, collection, transportation, recycling and disposal. A comprehensive legal framework should also be developed to regulate all aspects of e-waste management. The framework should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, such as government agencies, producers, importers, retailers, collectors, recyclers and consumers, to ensure transparency and accountability. As part of this, producers, importers, retailers, collectors and recyclers should register with authorities and report their activities. Clear and measurable targets for e-waste collection and recycling are essential for tracking e-waste movement and disposal, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and best practices. Additionally, they can provide valuable data and information on e-waste generation and management that can be used for planning and decision-making. Investing in infrastructure and technology for safe and efficient e-waste collection, transportation, recycling and disposal is crucial to address this issue effectively. Extended producer responsibility: Extended Producer Responsibility is a practical solution to reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption. It requires producers and importers to collect and recycle their products at the end of their life cycle, incentivising companies to design durable, repairable and recyclable products. Producer responsibility can take many forms, such as mandatory take-back schemes, deposit-refund systems, advance disposal fees or eco-labels. The decision by the EU to switch from a proprietary port to a USB C is a great example of extended producer responsibility. As a result, Apple introduced USB C ports in their iPhone 15 model, which reduces the burden on consumers and the government in managing e-waste. Another solution that could be implemented is a green tax or fee system that charges producers based on the environmental performance of their products. The green tax or fee system could use a rating system that evaluates the products according to various criteria, like energy consumption, hazardous substance content, recyclability, repairability, etc. The higher the rating, the lower the tax or fee. The revenue from the green tax or fee system could be used to fund e-waste management activities or support green innovation. A common platform for producers, importers, retailers and consumers could enable seamless collection, recycling and safe disposal of electronic devices. This could help create a market for recycled materials and stimulate innovation in product design and recycling technology. Circular economy: To tackle the growing e-waste problem, we must adopt a circular economy approach that prioritises resource efficiency and minimisation. E-waste recycling can be a sustainable way to create green jobs, promote a circular economy and reduce waste. This approach involves using products, parts and materials for as long as possible and viewing waste as a valuable resource. The circular economy model for electronics offers numerous benefits, including resource conservation, environmental impact reduction, value recovery and climate change mitigation. Implementing a circular economy for e-waste could lower GHG emissions, conserve natural resources, create new jobs, enhance competitiveness, generate income, promote social equity, and reduce health risks. A World Bank study estimated that implementing a circular economy for e-waste could generate an annual net benefit of $62 billion for Bangladesh by 2050 compared to the current development path. Recycling facilities: A potential solution to address the issue of e-waste in Bangladesh is to establish a certification system for e-waste recycling or disposal facilities. This system would require facilities to meet minimum standards and criteria for operation, technology, output and emission. The government should establish clear procedures for granting environmental clearance certificates based on compliance with environmental and occupational health and safety standards. According to a report by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, only 10 per cent of the e-waste facilities in Bangladesh have environmental clearance certificates from the Department of Environment, while the rest operate without legal authorisation or monitoring. The system should ensure adequate equipment and technology to handle hazardous substances safely and separate or recover different materials. The government should also conduct regular inspections and audits to ensure proper operation and performance and impose penalties or sanctions for non-compliance or violations. This system can ensure the quality and safety of e-waste facilities, prevent pollution or accidents, and protect workers\u2019 rights. The certification system could follow international best practices and standards, such as the e-Stewards or R2 standards for e-waste recyclers. Informal sector: Recognising and integrating the informal sector workers into the formal e-waste management system is crucial. They should receive incentives, training, certification and support. Enhancing the capacity and safety of both formal and informal e-waste recyclers by providing them with technical assistance, financial incentives and protective equipment is also important. This can help them improve their practices, reduce health and environmental risks and increase income and social status. Developing formal sector facilities for safe and efficient collection, transportation, dismantling and recycling of e-waste, complying with environmental standards and providing decent employment opportunities can reduce the reliance on informal sector workers and increase the recovery rate of valuable materials from e-waste. Consumers: A nationwide campaign on e-waste awareness and action targeting consumers or end-users could be launched to address the gap in e-waste management. Through awareness campaigns, incentive schemes, convenient collection systems and feedback mechanisms, consumers should be empowered. The campaign could use various media channels to educate consumers about the environmental and health impacts of improper e-waste disposal and the benefits of reducing, reusing and recycling electronic devices. This can encourage consumers to adopt eco-friendly practices like buying energy-efficient products, extending device lifespan, donating or selling old devices and disposing of e-waste at authorised collection points. Consumers should also be given economic incentives or rewards for returning their discarded or unused products to authorised traders, sellers, or collection centres. A survey by the Bangladesh Institute of ICT in Development found that 74 per cent of the consumers in Bangladesh were unaware of the proper disposal methods of e-waste, and 64 per cent were willing to participate in e-waste awareness campaigns. Public-private partnership: Promoting public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder collaboration among government agencies, producers, importers, retailers, collectors, recyclers, NGOs and consumers to establish a sustainable and inclusive system of e-waste management is another solution. This can help to create a shared vision and responsibility, mobilise resources and expertise and ensure transparency and accountability. Strengthening regional and international cooperation on e-waste management to share knowledge, experiences, resources and solutions is also beneficial. Research and innovation: To improve data collection, develop technology and add value to e-waste, we must encourage research and innovation in e-waste management. This will help us better understand the e-waste situation in Bangladesh, find the best practices and solutions for managing e-waste and create new economic and social development opportunities. We can also work towards a zero-carbon economy focusing on climate change education, research and innovation by encouraging innovation and research on new products, processes and business models that reduce e-waste generation and enhance resource recovery. Conclusion E-WASTE management is not just an environmental concern; it\u2019s an economic opportunity and a matter of social justice. E-waste is a global problem that requires local solutions. A comprehensive approach founded on data, technology, regulation, research and innovation is essential for a sustainable and prosperous zero-carbon future where e-waste is managed responsibly. In doing so, Bangladesh can contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals, primarily SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), while creating a world where climate action is evidence-based and tailored to local needs. Together, we can build a future where the adverse impacts of e-waste are minimised, benefiting both people and the planet. Md Zahurul Al Mamun is an independent climate researcher.","filter_flag":1}

This is a political fact. It is true for 56 per cent of Conservatives and 73 per cent of Labour voters, according to our recent polling. It applies for both Brexit camps, too: 56 per cent for leave and 72 per cent for remain. We are more united than divided on becoming a green superpower. And yet the economics of net zero is being increasingly politicised. Voters feel stuck between wanting to tackle climate change and worrying about higher bills. But energy bills will remain volatile for as long as we rely on international gas supply. We can lower bills in the long term and strengthen our economy through a nationwide drive to decarbonise Britain\u2019s homes and increasing the amount of renewable energy on the grid. Rather than diluting and delaying key policies and targets, we need to change how we use energy. Reducing reliance on gas, and making our energy system more flexible and renewables cheaper, will keep bills down whilst creating thousands of jobs and boosting GDP. And all this needs to happen in regions that need it the most. Such green growth requires substantial funding \u2013 but this is an investment, not a cost. The government estimates \u00a3250bn would be needed to take us towards a new circular economy where every region, business and individual can seize the huge opportunities of the green transition. My company OVO, one of the UK\u2019s biggest energy suppliers, has an instrumental role to play in this change. We are in a position to innovate and introduce new products and services that will create a multiplier effect on growth. Unlocking our economy through transforming our energy use means a vast infrastructure update for the UK and a major drive to boost renewables. But the UK is failing to make the policy decisions necessary to meet net zero by 2050. Three areas stand out. First, we need to insulate our homes to help us use less energy. Our housing stock is the leakiest in Europe, losing heat up to three times faster than in Germany or Sweden. This lack of proper insulation, combined with our reliance on fossil fuels, means the UK\u2019s housing contributes a third of its total emissions. The answer? We need a vaccination-style retrofitting drive to rapidly insulate and double glaze our homes. And we must prioritise support for installing insulation for those who will benefit the most from lower bills. There is already some funding in place, but we must go further and faster in reducing barriers to access. Beyond this targeted support, more private and government finance will make it easier for all households to access retrofitting funding. This retrofitting campaign will bring bills and emissions down quickly as people use less energy to heat their homes. That means there will be more money to spend elsewhere, helping to stimulate the economy after a period of stagnation. Second, we need to electrify our homes to make more use of renewables. Electrification requires a more flexible grid which adjusts according to consumer demand so we don\u2019t rely on fossil fuels at times of peak usage. [See also: The grim consequences of Sunak\u2019s green scepticism] Such a system needs flexibility at home too, which industry can encourage. Customers who are informed about their energy usage can time it to ease pressure on the grid. Last winter, OVO rewarded its customers for using energy at off-peak times. This Power Move scheme has recently expanded across the country, so households stand to gain as much as \u00a315m by using energy at times when it\u2019s typically cleaner and cheaper. Electricity bills are also made more expensive by related costs \u2013 such as social and environmental obligation costs \u2013 which help to fund much-needed government levies and discounts. Government should fund these through general taxation so it doesn\u2019t increase the price for households. Not only would this make energy bills lower for everyone, it would also make powering homes on renewable electricity more appealing. Underscoring all of this is the need for the UK to generate enough renewable energy to consistently meet demand. Looking across the Atlantic you can see that incentivising investment in renewable energy could boost our economy. In the year since Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act passed, green energy projects in the US have received \u00a3218bn of investment \u2013 that\u2019s half a billion dollars every day. This towers above the \u00a3120bn generated in the UK, spread out over 13 years. To join in the green energy race and unleash its economic potential, we need policies that encourage renewable energy investment. And we need a workforce equipped to insulate our homes and connect them to our flexible, green grid. The Climate Change Committee estimates that up to 725,000 net new jobs could be created in the green transition. Businesses like OVO must commit to ring-fencing funding to train the workforce and policymakers must incentivise apprenticeships, where applications are falling year on year. These policies will go down well across the country. A government committed to levelling up will continue to dedicate funding and create jobs in areas like Anglesey, Aberdeen and Hull, where our renewables are currently generated. Being a green superpower whilst maintaining public support will test UK leadership. The UK has a unique opportunity to innovate and lead the way. With the next general election in sight, it\u2019s time to unite the country behind a net zero ambition that will create opportunity and prosperity for decades to come. OVO\u2019s fringe event at the Labour Party Conference takes place on 9 October at ACC Liverpool. [See also: What has the energy price cap got to do with the climate?]","filter_flag":1}

The study by Cranfield University assessed the sustainability of remanufacturing by comparing the carbon emissions created through Circular Computing\u2019s remanufactured laptops, in comparison to brand new. It found that remanufactured laptops produce only 6.34% of the CO2 emissions against new products, highlighting the sustainable benefits of buying into the tech circular economy, in addition to the huge impact it can have on reducing the electronic waste (e-waste) crisis. This means that for every Circular Computing remanufactured laptop, approximately 316kg (700lb) of CO2 emissions are prevented by not buying new. For just 1,000 laptops, that is the same as taking 80 cars off the road for a year. Over recent years, e-waste accumulation has been on a steep rise, parallel with the technological evolution of electrical and electronic equipment. Companies such as Circular Computing have adopted a remanufacturing approach built in the circular economy to help overcome the emerging waste issue in the last couple of decades, where goods can return to manufacturers or remanufacturers and be re-used. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor report, the global level of e-waste increased from 41.8 MT in 2014 to 53.6 MT in 2022, which is then predicted to reach 74.7 MT by 2030. The authors of the study, Cranfield University, identified that the fast evolution speed and short lifetime of current electronics are rapidly contributing causes to the growing mountains of e-waste. Circular Computing\u2019s Circular Remanufacturing Process is the only one in the world to have been awarded a BSI Kitemark, which attests that the products are \u201cequal to or better than new\u201d. Remanufacturing has therefore emerged as the viable alternative to new when it comes to changing the outdated habits of \u2018take, make and replace\u2019 in the tech industry. The study defines Remanufacturing as \u2018a form of product recovery that allows an item like a laptop to be reused without being totally broken down and changed into something else\u2019. When going through the remanufacturing process, 99% of existing technology is re-used in the process, with the remaining 1% being recycled to be used as pallets for transportation. \u201cProfessor Mark Jolly, Director of Manufacturing and Materials, Cranfield University, comments: \u201cFor those in the manufacturing sector, finding ways to create products, and thereby extending the useful life of the materials used, while not harming the planet, has been an ever-growing challenge. With e-waste being one of the many accumulating waste streams from the past few decades, finding solutions to address this is necessary in a climate emergency. The findings from our study show that Circular Computing\u2019s revolutionary remanufacturing process is an important step in the right direction in tackling this issue once and for all.\u201d Steve Haskew, Head of Sustainability and Social Leadership at Circular Computing, adds: \u201cThis peer-reviewed scientific study by Cranfield University illustrates the profound impact that remanufacturing can have when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions in the technology industry. In an age of increased environmental consciousness and the growing issue of e-waste, finding a way to re-use the vast amounts of electronic products in existence should be a key task for the industry. \u201cWe believe that remanufacturing is the only solution to this problem to tackle the environmental issues while still ensuring a high performance, good as new end product. Studies like this one by Cranfield University will hopefully start to make a clear impression on the minds of IT leaders to reconsider their approach to purchasing technology\u201d. Circular Computing is on a mission to create a more ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible way to buy enterprise grade IT. While already offering a carbon neutral plus product, the Cranfield University study also identified further ways that the process could be made even more sustainable. Following the study, Circular Computing will be analysing its processes for transportation, use of renewable energy and packing\/recycling of packaging to ensure every stage of the remanufacturing journey is as sustainable as possible, remaining rooted in the circular economy. About Circular Computing\u2122 Circular Computing\u2122 is the global leader in the remanufacturing of laptops, on a mission to create a more ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible way to buy enterprise grade IT.

This marks the first time 500mL sparkling beverages will be sold in bottles made from 100% recycled plastic* in Canada. The Coca-Cola Company announces that all 500mL bottles in its sparkling beverage portfolio will be made from 100% recycled plastic* by early 2024. (CNW Group\/The Coca\u2011Cola Company) \"With this transition, no virgin PET plastic will be used for our sparkling 500mL bottles under normal circumstances going forward in Canada,\" said Kurt Ritter, Vice President & General Manager, Sustainability, Coca-Cola North America. \"We hope that transitioning our 500mL sparkling portfolio to 100% recycled plastic will increase the amount of high-quality, food-grade, recycled plastic available in Canada and, ultimately, enable us to offer more of our brands in this sustainable format.\" The shift supports The Coca-Cola Company's World Without Waste goals to use at least 50% recycled content in its packaging by 2030, and to reduce the use of virgin plastic. It's projected to save 7.6 million pounds of new plastic in 2024 alone, as well as reduce nearly 7,000 metric tons of CO 2 emissions annually which is the equivalent of taking nearly 1,500 cars off the road for one year. Bottles made with 100% recycled plastic* create and sustain a circular economy for plastic packaging. Once the material (PET) is recycled, it is cleaned, sorted and ground into small flakes that become raw material for more new bottles. To build awareness and encourage consumers to continue recycling bottles, all 100% recycled plastic bottles* will feature \"Recycle Me Again\" messaging. \"We're proud to partner with The Coca-Cola Company on our transition to 100% recycled plastic bottles across Canada,\" said Todd Parsons, CEO of Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited. \"We're on a journey to be the leading beverage partner in Canada, and one of the ways we're doing that is by earning our social license to operate by driving a circular economy for our packaging. Every one of these 100% recycled plastic bottles represents meaningful progress on that journey.\" The new 100% recycled plastic bottles* will be produced locally at the Brampton, O.N., Calgary, A.B., Lachine, Q.C., and Richmond, B.C., manufacturing facilities, by Coke Canada Bottling. An independent, family-owned business, Coke Canada Bottling facilities from coast-to-coast are home to 6,000 diverse employees who proudly make, distribute, merchandise, and sell the most-loved beverages Canadians enjoy.

There are few companies in Lithuania that are able to recycle difficult-to-recycle plastic products, says Danas Poderis, CEO of Plasta. According to him, multi-layered plastic bags that are made of different materials are particularly difficult to recycle. Even the biodegradable bags are not as environmentally friendly as they sound. \u201cThe advertising message for this is quite popular \u2013 that this is a biodegradable bag. However, microplastic residues still remain. In our opinion, it is perhaps better to collect the plastic waste more carefully and reuse it instead of spreading that microplastic residue,\u201d Poderis says. Lithuania is at least three times behind the EU average when it comes to recycling plastic and using it to produce new products, according to the Economy and Innovation Ministry. Plastic (associative image) \/ L. Balandis\/BNS Technology needs to be developed to create efficient recycling methods, says Economy and Innovation Minister Au\u0161rin\u0117 Armonait\u0117, so around 8 million euros in support were earmarked for medium and small companies. \u201cThis is to help them, to subsidise them so that they bring waste back into the production process as raw materials,\u201d Armonait\u0117 explains. However, Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans, and Fisheries, says Lithuania is lacking in the circular economy strategy and recycling targets. \u201cIf you look at the circularity of the economy, Lithuania is well behind the EU average. [...] The target of recycling 65 percent of municipal waste generated by 2035 seems unattainable in Lithuania today,\u201d he notes. According to data from the Economy and Innovation Ministry, only around 4 percent of waste is recycled and reused in Lithuania today.","filter_flag":1}

This is in support of the global and our nation\u2019s sustainability agenda. Conventionally, the world today operates in a linear economic model, the take-make-dispose approach, where raw materials are extracted, then transformed into products that are used by consumers, until the materials are finally discarded as waste. In contrast, the circular economy model follows the reduce, reuse, recycle and recover (4R) approach, whereby the use of new and mined resources is minimised, while the reuse of products is maximised and materials are recycled back into the value chain. Waste is truly the resource of the future. Cenviro, which stands for \u201cclean environment\u201d, with 30 years of experience is the first company to successfully operate a scheduled waste-to-energy (SWtE) plant since 2018. Through its subsidiary Kualiti Alam Sdn Bhd, Cenviro owns and operates Malaysia\u2019s first and Southeast Asia\u2019s largest integrated waste management centre (WMC), which has been in operation since 1998 in Negeri Sembilan. The WMC is licensed to treat and dispose 76 of the 77 scheduled waste codes, which includes hazardous waste, e-waste and medical waste. Cenviro has another SWtE plant in Johor that will start operating in January 2024. Apart from its existing recycling arm (Cenviro Recycling Recovery Sdn Bhd), Cenviro extends its involvement in recycling and recovery via its associate company Shan Poornam Sdn Bhd, which is the largest e-waste and metal recycling and recovery service provider in Malaysia. It is also involved in municipal solid waste management with its joint-venture company, E-Idaman Sdn Bhd, in the northern part of Malaysia. Reducing, Reusing, Recycling and recovering Dr Johari Jalil, Group Managing Director Group managing director Dr Johari Jalil said Cenviro is focused on intensifying its capability of recycling and recovering valuable materials from scheduled waste that can be reused as resources or raw materials in industrial processes and to manufacture new products. The company already collects an average of 230,000 tonnes of scheduled waste annually. \u201cThe shift of the customer\u2019s focus right now is towards how we minimise waste because this is what the market expects. Therefore, aligned with our vision to become a modern resource company, our portfolio of incineration and landfills under treatment and disposal, which is currently about 80% of our group revenue, will shift to a more balanced 50:50 ratio with recycling and recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, you can\u2019t eliminate treatment and disposal entirely yet because not all materials can be fully recovered or recycled. If someone claims they can deliver zero waste, that\u2019s far-fetched,\u201d says Johari. In future, with the advancement of technology, recycling capability can be further enhanced along with the manufacturer\u2019s drive to intensify using recyclable raw materials in its production. Cenviro has adopted the waste hierarchy model by reducing its own resource consumption, recovering and reusing existing materials and waste in its operations, and subsequently producing energy before diverting the residual waste to landfills. For example, recycling waste oil to fuel its incinerators including reusing wooden pallets and combustible waste, powering its plants using solar panels on the roof of the buildings, reusing treated wastewater for plant quenching, harvesting rain for grey water and generating electricity from its SWtE for the national grid. This is in line with the company\u2019s sustainability tagline of \u201cSHIELDing the Environment for Future Generations\u201d. Innovative solution to create landfill space The Vertical Secured Landfill is engineered on top of an existing landfill, effectively extending the lifespan of the landfill for many more years Cenviro manages the first Vertical Secured Landfill (VSL), which refers to an innovative and safe environmental solution that creates more landfill space and capacity vertically, without the clearing of more land. \u201cThe easiest way to operate a landfill is to build a new landfill from new land, but at the moment, we curb our need to sacrifice new land by deploying the VSL method instead. In simple terms, it is a landfill engineered on an existing landfill to prolong the lifespan of our landfill by many more years,\u201d said Johari. \u201cIf we want to position ourselves as a modern resource company, the agenda of sustainability and modern resourcing need to converge. These cannot be diverging when you talk about sustainability but at the same time you are opening more landfills and incinerating a lot more waste,\u201d he pointed out. To further enhance its recycling and recovery capability and capacity, the Cenviro board has approved an investment of RM200 million to undertake several projects in Cenviro Eco Park, its recycling hub, due to be completed in the next three years. This includes a plant that will recover and recycle food-grade PET plastic and turn it into recycled PET nurdles, as well as the recycling of used oil and sludge from the automotive and shipping industries to be repurposed as recycled base oil, and waste chemicals from the rubber industry to produce reprocessed rubber. Cenviro\u2019s ambitions are also in line with Khazanah\u2019s long-term strategy of Advancing Malaysia and to drive impactful outcomes for the country. The company\u2019s greater focus on recycling and recovery is also in line with Khazanah\u2019s strategy of creating a sustainable future where it hopes to play a leading role in shaping an equitable and responsible environmental, social and governance (ESG) transition for Corporate Malaysia. Regional expansion & IPO plans Johari said the strategic partnership with South Korea\u2019s SK Ecoplant, which owns 30% of the company, will further propel Cenviro\u2019s expansion and branding beyond Malaysia. The partnership with SK Ecoplant, a renowned global leader, especially in research and development enhancements, allows the company to gain access to a wide range of sustainability and R&D projects that are aligned with its goals. \u201cSK Ecoplant\u2019s expertise in technical and technological advancements is invaluable in our mission to promote the circular economy model for greener waste management. It also enables us to grow regionally. As the biggest player in the country, our growth catalyst would be through acquisitions and many of them will be outside of Malaysia, likely in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and so on. These are the countries that will grow in their industrial expansion,\u201d he said. In March 2022, Cenviro issued its first sustainability-linked sukuk of RM54.6 million in two tranches from its unrated Islamic medium-term note programme of up to RM500 million in nominal value. The issuance was in line with its commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 5% by 2025 from its base year of 2020. This is despite a substantial project pipeline of new facilities in the next three years. Cenviro recently received the Best Sustainability-Linked Sukuk award at the Asset Triple A\u2019s Islamic Finance Awards 2023. On the company\u2019s plan for an initial public offering (IPO), Johari said Cenviro has already mapped out its capital requirements for the future, which will encompass the need for capital injection to fund acquisitions, major sustainability projects, R&D as well as expansion to areas where it is not a dominant player, such as Sabah and Sarawak and Southeast Asia.","filter_flag":1}

The \u2018O2 Recycle for Business\u2019 service has been relaunched to help companies of all sizes trade in their old technology \u2013 where they can receive cash back, credit towards new devices, or donate funds to charity. Any company can use O2 Recycle for Business, regardless of their mobile provider. O2 Recycle has processed more than 3.8 million business and consumer devices since its launch in 2009, and last year paid out more than \u00a3670,000 to businesses. Devices are data wiped and 92% are either recycled or refurbished and resold as \u2018like new\u2019 products to customers \u2013 supporting the circular economy, with the remainder broken down for raw materials. None of the tech that goes through O2 Recycle ends up in a landfill. Businesses baffled by how to go green It comes as new research reveals UK businesses are bamboozled by how to recycle their old tech and want help to become more sustainable. The study has found 7 in 10 (70%) companies would like to be \u2018greener\u2019 but just don\u2019t know how to go about handling their electronic waste, resulting in organisations hoarding unused phones and laptops for a year, on average. Furthermore, three-quarters (76%) of firms say they need to be more responsible with disposing of their old tech, and 8 in 10 (82%) organisations want a simple solution to help their business recycle their unwanted devices. Five clicks to collection With enhancements to the O2 Recycle for Business platform, organisations can now recycle their phones and tablets in five simple steps, registering multiple devices at once, and arranging a free courier collection to take the devices away. The service also supports employees working remotely who have many unused devices stashed in drawers, garages or lofts, as businesses can send them a QR code so they can also post the items to O2 Recycle for free. Businesses can use their credit to buy new devices via O2 or donate up to 100% of their cash back to Virgin Media O2\u2019s charity partner, Good Things Foundation, to support digital inclusion projects across the UK. O2 Recycle for Business also supports organisations to lower their Scope 3 supply chain carbon emissions by ensuring that devices are more likely to be given a second life. The initiative forms part of Virgin Media O2\u2019s sustainability strategy, the Better Connections Plan, where the company is working to support consumers and businesses to carry out 10 million \u2018circular actions\u2019 by the end of 2025. Jo Bertram, Managing Director at Virgin Media O2 Business, said: \u201cO2 Recycle for Business provides companies with a simple way to remove unused devices cluttering their offices \u2013 and be rewarded for it. \u201cOpen to businesses of all sizes whether a customer of ours or not, this initiative provides businesses with a responsible method to dispose of their e-waste, all while providing the trade-in value of the device or the opportunity to donate that to our charity partner, Good Things Foundation.\u201d Miranda Apps at GB Railfreight, said: \u201cO2 Recycle has enabled our organisation to safely recycle our obsolete devices, minimising pollution and waste. This saves energy and also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. The process has been easy to manage and is a cost-effective way to reutilise old equipment.\u201d Businesses can find out more about trading in their old devices through O2 Recycle for Business here.","filter_flag":1}

Tyre Stewardship Australia and Clark Rubber have teamed up in a bid to have more recycled tyre-derived material used in the manufacturing of new products in Australia. TSA has made its Market Development Fund available to Australian manufacturers, innovators, entrepreneurs, polymer experts and other relevant businesses who can demonstrate how rubber from used tyres can be used as an ingredient to new products. Grants up to $250,000 are available to organisations who need the extra support to commercialise their innovations or products containing used tyres. The Tyre Stewardship Australia (TSA) Market Development Fund is not new but what is new is the collaboration with Clark Rubber, Australia\u2019s only national retailer dedicated to selling all things \u201crubber.\u201d Lina Goodman, TSA Chief Executive Officer, emphasises the significance of the opportunity, stating, \u201cThis collaboration, supported by the TSA Market Development Fund is a clever opportunity for Australians to create high performance rubber products that align with Australia\u2019s goals for a circular economy\u201d. \u201cWe would love to see more products on our shelves that include Australian recycled tyre materials, and the TSA fund is a fantastic way for manufacturers to get financial support to do this. We can\u2019t wait to see the great new ideas that are generated,\u201d said Anthony Grice, Clark Rubber Chief Executive Officer. Businesses such as A1 Rubber are leading the way in repurposing end-of-life tyres for a range of purposes, including mats for gyms, utes and vans, rubber tiling and pavers, wet pour rubber and much more. Tim Ekert, A1 Rubber Chief Executive Officer, said the company started 30 years ago, driven by the idea that tyre rubber is too valuable to discard. \u201cAt A1 Rubber we upcycle about 8000 to 9000 tonnes of tyres each year, there is room for more manufacturing using local high quality tyre-derived polymers,\u201d he said. \u201cCommercialising new ideas is often the most challenging step. Market development and sales experience are vital.

So far the O2 Recycle service claims to have processed more than 3.8 million business and consumer devices since its launch in 2009, and last year paid out more than \u00a3670,000 to businesses. Devices are typically data wiped and 92% are either recycled or refurbished and resold as \u2018like new\u2019 products to customers \u2013 supporting the circular economy, with the remainder broken down for raw materials (nothing ends up in a landfill). NOTE: Any company can use O2 Recycle for Business, regardless of their mobile provider. However, the announcement is a little unclear about what\u2019s changed with the relaunched scheme (we\u2019re not familiar enough with it to know what\u2019s truly new vs old), although their \u201cenhancements\u201d are said to mean that organisations can now recycle their phones and tablets in five simple steps, registering multiple devices at once, and arranging a free courier collection to take the devices away. The service also supports employees working remotely who have many unused devices stashed in drawers, garages or lofts, as businesses can send them a QR code so they can also post the items to O2 Recycle for free. Businesses can then use their credit to buy new devices via O2 or donate up to 100% of their cash back to Virgin Media O2\u2019s charity partner, Good Things Foundation, to support digital inclusion projects across the UK. Jo Bertram, MD of VMO2 Business, said: \u201cO2 Recycle for Business provides companies with a simple way to remove unused devices cluttering their offices \u2013 and be rewarded for it. Open to businesses of all sizes whether a customer of ours or not, this initiative provides businesses with a responsible method to dispose of their e-waste, all while providing the trade-in value of the device or the opportunity to donate that to our charity partner, Good Things Foundation.\u201d O2 Recycle for Business also supports organisations to lower their Scope 3 supply chain carbon emissions by ensuring that devices are more likely to be given a second life.","filter_flag":1}
