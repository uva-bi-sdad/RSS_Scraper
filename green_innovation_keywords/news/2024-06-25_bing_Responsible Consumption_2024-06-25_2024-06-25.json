The awards across 15 categories were presented to the winners at the ESG PIA 2022 gala night on June 8 at M Resort & Hotel Kuala Lumpur. The ESG PIA, which honours remarkable initiatives within the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspect, was made possible by OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd (OCBC Bank) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM). The submissions were evaluated by a panel of judges based on a set criteria across three ESG pillars. Geomax won Gold in Responsible Consumption and Production under the Environment pillar on top of the Outstanding ESG Initiative for SMEs to Mid-Tier. The ESG PIA embodies a collective commitment to creating a more sustainable and equitable Malaysia, and a recognition of companies which have done the work to make a tangible impact on society and the environment. The inaugural awards also saw Geomax Rubber Innovative Products Sdn Bhd and Heineken Malaysia Bhd pick up the award for \u201cThe Most Outstanding ESG Initiatives of The Year\u201d for the \u201cSME to mid-tier\u201d and \u201clarge companies\u201d categories respectively. Supporting sustainable values As the main sponsor of the ESG Positive Impact Awards, OCBC Bank congratulated all the winners on their achievements in their pursuit of sustainability. \u201cAs financiers, we actively seek to enable the creation and adoption of ground-breaking solutions that are not only economically viable, but also environmentally and socially sustainable in their contribution towards nation building over the longer term,\u201d said OCBC Bank chief executive officer Tan Chor Sen. \u201cTo deliver on our own sustainability and climate commitments, we must encourage all our stakeholders, especially our customers, to strengthen the management of material ESG factors within their businesses,\u201d Tan added. He continued by saying that recognition works wonders for \u201censuring the desired posture continues to be held, and then bettered\u201d. Besides the award for Outstanding ESG Initiative for Large Companies, Heineken won Gold twice, one for Waste Management and the other for Innovative Partnership. He added that the ESG PIA represents a prime platform for promoting sustainability through recognising the good that companies are currently doing. \u201cThat aside, the part played by role models should never be underestimated. We believe that by bringing those who have done well in ESG to the fore, others will have a solid foundation to work from. \u201cThrough our shared experiences we will be able to build and uplift each other. \u201cAnd, along the way, we will be sounding the clarion call for even more companies to join us in this sustainability journey,\u201d he emphasised. (From left) Wang, Tan, Renuka, Mohamad Razif and Yeow celebrating Heineken winning the Most Outstanding ESG Initiative Award for Large Companies. OCBC Bank also sees the awards as a way to influence other businesses and industries to adopt ESG practices and contribute to a more sustainable future no matter the size of the organisation. \u201cThis is all about setting the right agenda. \u201cAs more and more companies begin to witness the emergence of peers who are getting it right in the ESG space, they will find themselves compelled to do what is right,\u201d said Tan. \u201cThe more we talk about what is good, the better the chance we have of ensuring the desired agenda stays in the minds of our key audiences. \u201cWhile larger corporations may lead the way in charting their transition journeys, the awards also showcased SMEs\u2019 diversity in innovative efforts across industries and sustainable focus areas. \u201cThis should spur more emerging enterprises to develop new products and services in carrying out their crucial role as changemakers or disruptors, providing impetus for climate action at scale,\u201d he noted. Tan also shared words of advice for businesses looking to start sustainable initiatives by using the success of the winners of ESG PIA as an anchoring point.

And sometimes there is not enough of an internal push to get things going. \u201cThe ESG PIA help point those who are new to the journey in the right direction to look to those who have done well and to emulate them,\u201d Tan said encouragingly. Meanwhile, co-sponsor TM also lauded the winners during the gala night. TM chief corporate and regulatory officer Tengku Muneer Tengku Muzani shared that TM, as an organisation dedicated to nation building, has always had sustainability at the heart of what they do. \u201cOur main goal has always been to make a positive impact on people\u2019s lives while finding a balance between profits and purpose. We not only view sustainability as a moral obligation but also as an opportunity to create value for everyone involved. \u201cWe are determined to incorporate sustainability from every aspect of our core business to the daily practices of our employees,\u201d he said.

We aspire to contribute to a brighter future for the rakyat,\u201d he added. TM also said that the ESG PIA is a great platform for businesses making progress in their sustainability efforts and following the best environmental, social, and governance practices. Renuka (sixth from left) with the elegantly attired Heineken team. \u201cWhen a media organisation like The Star recognises these businesses, it inspires companies of all sizes and from different industries to join in and adopt responsible practices for a better and more sustainable future. \u201cNevertheless, establishing a sustainable future needs joint efforts from all parties. \u201cIt is not a race or a competition, but rather a process that requires commitment from various stakeholders and should be implemented in a collaborative manner,\u201d he noted. He continued saying that being involved in such awards has inspired TM to look closer into their supplier ecosystem, with the Group being another key stakeholder to them.

Outstanding entries \u201cI will continue to work hard to create more impact and inspire the younger generation,\u201d said Geomax Rubber Innovative Products director Steven Ng. The company also won Gold in the Responsible Consumption and Production category. The grand ballroom hosted 100 companies during the ESG PIA 2022. Besides winning the outstanding awards for the year, Heineken also bagged two Gold awards in the categories of Waste Management and Innovative Partnership. The brewery\u2019s Corp Affairs and Legal Director Renuka Indrarajah said, \u201cWe began with a water project, which is taking care of the water resources behind our brewery and today, our initiatives cut right across our entire value chain.\u201d She added that Heineken Malaysia was looking at how to minimise its environmental impact and how to make a positive one for the society around them. The awards was organised to promote Malaysia\u2019s ESG agenda through recognising the role and contributions of outstanding businesses towards a sustainable future. \u2018When I started on the ESG journey, nobody believed that the ESG focus or that environment itself were important issues that needed solving,\u2019 says Geomax Rubber Innovative Products Sdn Bhd director Steven Ng. Through these role models, it hopes to inspire other businesses to consider building, adopting and enhancing their own ESG initiatives \u2013 from SMEs to large corporations. ESG PIA 2022 categories were divided within the three main ESG pillars, with the Environment Awards covering Sustainable Ecosystems, Water Management and Efficiency, Waste Management, Responsible Consumption and Production, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. The Social Awards covers Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Relations with Local Communities; Human Rights and Labour Standards; Talent Management; and Good Health and Wellbeing. The Governance Awards has one category that focuses on Governance, Reporting and Transparency. There were also three standalone awards that are related to ESG and grouped under Other Awards category and these include Supply Chain Management, Innovative Partnership and Transformation. Stay tuned this July for more on the ESG PIA 2022. The ESG Positive Impact Awards 2022 was organised by SMG and endorsed by the NRECC ministry with OCBC Bank as main sponsor and TM as co-sponsor.","filter_flag":1}

It follows the Club becoming a signatory of the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework, which supports and guides sports organisations globally to achieve climate change goals, in January 2021. The Race to Zero high ambition track was launched at last year\u2019s COP26 and aims to rally non-state actors \u2013 including companies, cities, regions, financial and educational institutions \u2013 to take rigorous and immediate action to work towards achieving net zero carbon in line with the Paris Agreement, with transparent action plans and robust targets. The Sports for Climate Action initiative calls on sporting organisations to acknowledge the contribution of the sports sector to climate change and a collective responsibility to strive towards climate neutrality for a safer planet. By signing the Framework, the Club has demonstrated its commitment to playing its part to ensure the sports sector is on the path to a low-carbon future. In line with the five core principles enshrined in the Framework and the aims of the Paris Agreement, signatories strive to: promote greater environmental responsibility; reduce the overall climate impact from sports; use their platforms to educate for climate action; promote sustainable and responsible consumption; and advocate for climate action through communications. Until recently, most companies have focused on measuring emissions from their own operations and electricity consumption (Scope 1 and 2). Scope 3 accounts for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a company\u2019s entire value chain. These are considered indirect emissions as are not under the company\u2019s direct control. Scope 3 emissions are broken down into 15 categories which span the entire upstream and downstream activities of a company. Scope 3 emissions often account for 80% - 99% of a company\u2019s total emissions footprint and it is therefore important to understand these emissions. Assessing the entire value chain emissions impact can help to identify where to focus reduction activities. The Club measured its Scope 3 emissions footprint for the first time in 2022. For the reporting period July 2021 - June 2022, the entire Tottenham Hotspur Ltd business produced 76,698 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) worth of Scope 3 emissions. These emissions account for over 90% of the Club\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Our emissions are reported on a consolidation, operational control approach, as defined by the GHG Protocol. All emissions have been calculated following the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the guidelines of the ISO14064-1. All applicable Scope 3 categories have been quantified. Th Club reports its emissions on a tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) basis. Each greenhouse gas has a different global warming potential (GWP) compared to carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, methane (CH4) has a warming potential 28 times that of CO2. Therefore, to be able to compare the emissions from all the Kyoto protocol GHGs on a like-for-like basis, they are converted to tCO2e using their respective GWP. The most significant source of Scope 3 emissions is fan travel to and from Tottenham Hotspur matches. These emissions have been included under the Scope 3 category \u201cDownstream Transport and Distribution\u201d, and account for 47% of the company's total greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Emissions embedded in purchased goods and services, capital goods, and business travel are also significant contributors to Scope 3 emissions. Our Scope 3 emissions are being addressed through engagement with suppliers and fans and internal policy changes. We are in the process of producing a decarbonisation action plan which will detail the short, medium and long term actions we will take to meet near-term and net-zero targets. Emissions Scope and Scope 3 Category June 2022 - July 2023 GHG Emissions (tCO2e) Scope 1 2,503 Gas 2,029 Transport (excluding grey fleet) 72 F-Gas 402 Scope 2 (location-based) 4,684 Scope 2 (market-based) 0 Scope 3 86,444 1: Purchased Goods and Services 21,503 2.

Guided by Ferrero Group's long-standing commitment to having a positive impact throughout its value chain, the report demonstrates the considerable headway across its key sustainability pillars: Protecting the Environment, Sourcing Ingredients Responsibly, Promoting Responsible Consumption and Empowering People. \"Ferrero Group recognises the critical role that the company plays in safeguarding nature for future generations. We reaffirmed through concrete engagements that sustainability is embedded in Ferrero's long-term strategy. All four pillars of our sustainability framework guide every strategic decision we take\" said Giovanni Ferrero, Executive Chairman of the Ferrero Group. \"As Ferrero grows and diversifies its portfolio, we continue to value our long-term partnerships, in particular those dedicated to the communities where we operate and where our raw materials are sourced. We believe in the importance of partnerships to achieve progress, to move forward our sector's social and environmental agenda, and finally to create societal value.\" The latest Sustainability Report, for the 2022\/23 financial year, highlights Ferrero's continued focus on driving greater transparency across its core-ingredients supply chain, in line with its responsible sourcing approach. In its hazelnut supply chain, Ferrero has now achieved 90% traceability \u2013 a significant increase from the 79% reached in previous year 2021\/22 \u2013 sustained by its continued work with farmers, suppliers, institutions, universities, and research centres to promote and share sustainable farming practices. In collaboration with partners on the ground, Ferrero has also helped address complex supply chain challenges, like deforestation, across the areas from which it sources ingredients. For example, using satellite mapping to help increase traceability of cocoa back to farm level to 93% in 2022\/23. As well as working extensively with cutting edge technology, Ferrero is a long-standing member of the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI). Collaboration has also played a key role in accelerating progress on tackling the causes behind child and forced labour. Ferrero continues to partner with Save the Children, working with 65 communities in the Haut-Sassandra Region in Ivory Coast, one of the main sourcing countries for cocoa, reaching over 18,000 people. Ferrero is also working with Earthworm Foundation and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) across its palm oil and hazelnut supply chains respectively to help support responsible labour practices.
