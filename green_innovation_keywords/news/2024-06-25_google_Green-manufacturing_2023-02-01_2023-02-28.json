Consequently, the organization has been able to scale up in numerous locations worldwide. In an interview with McKinsey\u2019s Pablo Hernandez, Praj Industries founder and executive chairman Dr. Pramod Chaudhari discusses what he\u2019s learned along the way, how to build custom solutions, and how the next generation of start-ups can approach sustainability. Key insight #1: Maintain a balanced view of people, profit, and the planet. Emphasis on one area should not come at the expense of another. Pablo Hernandez: Sustainable growth is clearly a priority for you at Praj Industries. How do you balance that vision while also trying to run a profitable business? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari biography Dr. Pramod Chaudhari founded Praj Industries in the early 1980s to promote bio-based solutions to reduce environmental impacts and propagate sustainability. Dr. Chaudhari is globally recognized for his contributions to the bioeconomy. He is the first Asian to receive the prestigious William C. Holmberg Award 2022 for Lifetime Achievement in the Bioeconomy, and the first Indian to receive the George Washington Carver Award 2020. Dr. Chaudhari also received the BioSpectrum Leadership Award for his work in promoting the cause of biofuels and helping to build a resilient industry ecosystem over the past three decades. Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: Entrepreneurs can adopt green practices in their business to help create new opportunities. For example, if they come from a manufacturing background, they could build models that show how green manufacturing approaches, such as using renewable power, can minimize their carbon footprint. By embedding these ideas in the company from the beginning, entrepreneurs can strike a good balance among people, planet, and profit. Unfortunately, right now the people element is suffering across many companies, especially as digital technology evolves. Automation, for instance, is having a big impact on employment as its use increases. At the same time, technology is also responsible for a lot of new professions and businesses emerging worldwide. The question is, how can we get people interested in learning how to embrace these new opportunities and strike the right balance? Key insight #2: Make passion, purpose, and innovation through failure foundational to your business. Pablo Hernandez: What are your most significant insights from running such a large company? Is there anything you would recommend to other start-up leaders? About Praj Industries Praj Industries is an industrial biotechnology company based in India, offering technology solutions for producing renewable transportation fuels and renewable chemicals and materials. Over the past four decades, Praj has focused on the environment, energy, and the agri-process industry. The company has more than 1,000 customer references spanning more than 100 countries across five continents. Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: You must base your business on purpose and passion, and we can all learn how to do this better. After that, finding the right people and motivating them to get on board is important. When you have the right mix of passion and purpose and the right people, you can get them to do extraordinary things because they will work hard. Of course, leaders must also empower their teams and give them freedom to explore lots of opportunities for innovation\u2014this is often forgotten. Praj Industries is no longer a small garage company, but we make sure that we have a strong R&D focus, which helps us discover, introduce, and commercialize new technologies. By finding the right mix of innovation, people, purpose, and passion, we can grow even faster than normal businesses. Ultimately, innovation should minimize cost, create easier access to customer intelligence, and deliver best-in-class technology. Pablo Hernandez: In many of your writings, you emphasize the relevance of finding the right people. What characteristics do you look for in the people you work with? What attributes do you value most? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: Conventional attributes such as being hardworking and sincere and having dignity are the most important, especially for people who want to build a career in our organization. They must also not be afraid to fail. Failures are encouraged, as long as we learn from them, because if people can explore more ideas and approaches, then we can innovate quickly. We also value people with intrapreneurship qualities who have the mindset of an entrepreneur, meaning they embrace risk and are results-oriented and cost-conscious. A person with unique viewpoints and imagination can also help us find solutions that are effective and efficient. But it\u2019s affordability and innovation that play important roles in accelerating the commercialization of technology. Key insight #3: Develop a deep understanding of local environments, talent, and culture so you can build custom solutions. Pablo Hernandez: Your company has a footprint in more than 100 countries across five continents. How did you manage this? How would you advise other entrepreneurs who want to scale their businesses? Leap by McKinsey Leap by McKinsey works with established organizations to imagine, build, and scale new businesses\u2014and develop the capabilities needed to do it again and again. We bring together a global network of experts to build dynamic, innovative businesses that can reinvigorate entire organizations. Learn more about Leap by McKinsey. Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: In our business, biotechnology is influenced by the local environmental conditions. We come from a tropical climate, and that\u2019s the setting in which we gained experience, built on it, and found success. It wasn\u2019t until later that it became important to offer bespoke solutions. Finding custom solutions requires developing an understanding of the subject and the physical area in which you\u2019re working. When our intrapreneurs go outside India, they look for local knowledge. They need to know about the available logistics, the culture, and the economy of an area so they can adapt to those conditions. Therefore, we created a process to understand the local economy and costs of materials to adapt our products accordingly. We need to know how much this would cost in Africa, in India, in Southeast Asia. Taking the time to do this work shows customers that we are flexible, and it helps us arrive at a solution that is more suitable to a specific location. Pablo Hernandez: Finding the right people to fuel growth in certain markets is challenging. What is your approach? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: You cannot do everything centrally. You need to have the right blend of decentralization and centralization, which is why we sometimes rely on the skills of people in certain markets to help develop our products. For example, in Brazil, the locals\u2019 expertise in manufacturing fabricators was similar to or better than what we could offer in India. Our business approach has always been to think \u201cglocal\u201d\u2014that is, think global and act local. Learn to Leap interviews Key insight #4: Cultivate an optimistic mindset. This will help you come back from failure and find new solutions quickly. Pablo Hernandez: During the many years of running and scaling up your business, you faced challenges and even some failures. What did you learn from these experiences? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: Optimism is of paramount importance for entrepreneurs. I consider myself lucky in that regard because I am a robust optimist. When you\u2019re optimistic, it\u2019s easier to be innovative and find creative solutions. Of course, the focus should always be on the customer and how quickly and effectively we can satisfy their needs. At one point, most of my company\u2019s business depended on countries in Southeast Asia. Then, in the late 1990s, those countries went through a currency crisis. We had a strategy mismatch with existing products in new markets and new products in existing markets, so our company suffered. But we learned lessons from that situation, and I changed how we do business. Running a company is an endurance game and a team sport. Pablo Hernandez: How do you manage to push ahead in these challenging and complex moments? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: We focused on innovation, which helped us explore manufacturing in a different way, and we also began exploring new markets. Our focus shifted from Southeast Asia to South America, and then we ended up in Colombia. We saw that the country was importing oil and exporting sugar, so we said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use this extra sugar to make fuel?\u201d By working with local authorities and developer trade organizations, we helped them create their own ethanol-blended fuel. From 2003 to 2007, several products in that market reached almost 100 percent market share, which was huge. Because of our success in Colombia, we knew we could go to new markets and find the right technology solution to solve their specific problems. So from there we started working in developed countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This is just a small example, but with optimism, resilience, and an open mind for solutions, you can transform every failure into a lesson and seize the opportunity to grow successfully. Key insight #5: Learn how to anticipate problems so you can solve them swiftly; multiple solutions for the same challenge may exist. Pablo Hernandez: With the growth of your company, you\u2019ve been able to do a lot of new-business building, R&D, and product development. How do you balance creating new things while focusing on the performance of the current business? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: You need to train your team to \u201cchange the wheel while the car is running.\u201d You also need to get a feel for what the upcoming problems or challenges are so that you can be proactive about finding solutions. These practices can help you face challenges more confidently and comfortably. We have a strong conviction that our future growth drivers stem from R&D; hence, maintaining a healthy innovation pipeline is critical to business growth. In the hustle and bustle of running a business, we have always kept a steady eye on our R&D performance. Pablo Hernandez: Today, being \u201cgreen\u201d is a priority globally, with many initiatives running in parallel. If you were to start a new business, where would you start? Dr. Pramod Chaudhari: Genetically modified crops don\u2019t exist in most markets, except in the United States, though they are starting to take off in Europe. I think there should be a greater global effort to create affordable, scalable, and higher-quality genetically modified products that have a more robust life cycle. This way, we can use the same area of land but have more value-add products per each square meter of land. These improved crops may need less water, may not require pesticides, and could produce more and better yields. In this and other areas, biology plays a very important role. We cannot stop the growth of our population, but we can find ways and means to support [people] while not allowing the planet to suffer. Bio-based solutions can address both of these needs. Whenever I get the chance, I like to create awareness about climate action and solutions because each challenge brings the potential opportunity to find multiple solutions for the same problem. If everyone looks at things this way, then you can help yourself and others prosper.","filter_flag":1}

Before the one-on-one individual meetings would begin the following day, partners were given eight minutes to address the superintendents as a group. One by one, the 18 partners entered and exited the room. Here are some takeaway messages from each of them: The company: Smithco What: Sprayers, rollers and bunker rakes Who: Steven Johnson, regional sales manager What he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for an extremely long time. And we like to pride ourselves on the fact that we are innovators; we tend to lead the marketplace when it comes to new ideas. One thing that we like to brag about is that we are one modular component, tip-to-toe. Every component that we use on our spray rigs are TeeJet components. Dave Annis is our spray tech. So we actually have somebody that if it\u2019s something that distribution can\u2019t figure out or can\u2019t be sorted out over the phone, Dave will actually be on your property. He is a true asset to Smithco and what we do as far as our sprayer lines go.\u201d For more: Smithco.com The company: Turfco What: Widespin 1550 Broadcast Topdresser Who: Scott Kinkead, executive vice president What he said: \u201cThe 1550 is all about helping you and your staff be more productive. It\u2019s easier to load with an 80-inch hopper opening, it reduces the number of passes on your greens with its edge-to-edge consistency. A lot of time was spent on the design of the spinners and where the sands come into the spinners, so you can get different applications without any mechanical adjustments. Just set your eight different preferred applications for both the 1550 and the CR15 and you\u2019re able to get all your different applications with just the push of a button. What guys love about the 1550s is the confidence they have knowing you\u2019re always getting the perfect application you want so you and your staff can tackle other tasks.\u201d For more: Turfco.com The company: Quali-Pro Who: Jeff Rampino, Florida territory manager What he said: \u201cWe like to think of ourselves as a hybrid company. We\u2019re developing active ingredients. I think everyone has felt the pain of the supply chain issues; we\u2019ve been affected a lot less than others because of our ability, through our parent company Adama Group, to pull material from China and Israel because we are fully backward integrated. Adama gives us access to more than 270 active ingredient building blocks to put together new products for superintendents. All our products are formulated here in the U.S., our pesticides and fungicides are formulated onsite in our Houston facility and our herbicides are formulated in Georgia.\u201d For more: ControlSolutionsInc.com The company: PBI-Gordon What: Pedigree, Reunion Who: Andrew Scott, product manager and Melissa McDonald, marketing manager What they said: \u201cWhile we\u2019re certainly proud of our brands like SpeedZone EW, Segway and Q4 Plus, we\u2019re looking forward to talking about some of the newest solutions we\u2019ve brought to market. Solutions like Pedigree fungicide and Reunion fungicide, among others.\u201d \u2014 Scott \u201cWe also have a vast array of training and resources available online for superintendents and their staff to use. We\u2019re continuing to add more training modules and information that give short snippets that give a good overview of the products and some industry information. Supers can also earn points that are redeemable for gifts by completing training.\u201d \u2014 McDonald For more: PBIGordon.com The company: Seago International What: F-19 Gen 3 hover mower Who: Scott Sweeney, president What he said: \u201cWe launched our F-19 Gen 3 about nine years ago, and we\u2019ve taken a lot of input and put what we\u2019ve learned from superintendents, equipment managers and mechanics into the machine. We have an incredibly strong nylon-injected polymer deck, a tall impeller for maximum flow, stronger and longer handles and a high lift kit. To steal something from Papa John\u2019s, better ingredients make better hover mowers. Our normal decks get up to about 2 \u00bd. Our high lift kit clips into place, which takes our max height up to 3 \u00be. All of these machines are hand-assembled in Hickory, N.C. The machine has three blade options, stainless steel, quick change and a string option.\u201d For more: SeagoInternational.com The company: Frost What: Ninja GPS Spray Control System Who: Ken Rost, president & CEO What he said: \u201cWhen we came to this Golfdom Summit, we had superintendents ask us, \u2018why don\u2019t you have some turn-key sprayer that you can offer, that way we can put it in our budget and we can ask for it and get the whole thing wrapped up in one?\u2019 When we listened to that, we started looking for vehicle platforms. We chose the Kubota RTV 1140. That has proven to be the best move we have made. That machine, combined with our Ninja GPS Spray Control System, creates a sprayer that is accurate, reliable, repeatable and very productive. It gives the operator knowledge of what he is doing, and the superintendent a lot of feedback as to what is going out on the course. And we don\u2019t stop there, we keep listening. If you have ideas, we want to hear them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d For more: FrostServ.com The company: Harper Turf Equipment What: TV60 RE and TV60 RHD Tow-Behind Sweepers Who: Byron Riesen, territory manager What he said: \u201cWe manufacture niche products for the turf industry, specializing mostly in sweepers and vacuums. We\u2019re based out of Harper, Kan., and we\u2019ve been around since the early 1970s. One of the technologies we have in all our sweepers is called recirculating air. It is a dust-control technology that keeps the dust, dirt and even some of the noise pollution, contained within the system. You don\u2019t need screens or filters that need to be cleaned out regularly. And you have a cleaner working environment for the operator and you\u2019re less disruptive to the golfers. This is a patented technology that we use on all our sweepers.\u201d For more: HarperTurfEquipment.com The company: The Andersons What: Contec DG Who: Alan Hollen, territory manager What he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing Contec DG for quite some time, and it\u2019s been very successful. We\u2019ve expanded that technology to our humic lines and we\u2019re going to continue to develop new products. We really pride ourselves in our technologies. A lot of people can make nice N, P and Ks, blend them and make a nice homogenous product. We take it a step further. We have a robust research and development team. Last year we brought on Dr. Ben Pease from Iowa State, fantastic guy, very smart. He\u2019s sitting there in research and development and that\u2019s why, every year, you\u2019re going to see new products from us when you come to the golf show.\u201d For more: AndersonsPlantNutrients.com\/Turf The company: Steel Green Manufacturing What: SGXL Who: Caleb Myers, demo rep What he said: \u201cWe make stand-on spreader-sprayers. Over the last four years, our bread and butter has been in the lawn care industry, but we\u2019re venturing out into golf and sports turf. We just celebrated our four-year anniversary. The SGXL is a 120-gallon sprayer with a 14-foot rear boom. Adjustments from rate to rate are very simple. This machine is not limited to liquid. The tank lifts off with four bolts and two hydraulic hoses, and you can drop on a 350-pound (capacity) stainless steel hopper. The fert trays on the sides hold five bags of fertilizer on either side, giving you an additional 500 pounds of capacity.\u201d For more: SteelGreenMfg.com The company: FMC What: Fame, Rayora, Kalida and Serata Who: Tracy Tudor, key customer manager What he said: \u201cIn 2020, we moved into the next generation DMI with Rayora for dollar spot, gray leaf spot, brown patch control, in cool season grasses, as well as spring dead spot in warm season grasses. In 2021 we launched a superior combination product that has an SDHI and a DMI product called Kalida. We had a huge presence at the golf show in 2022 with our brand new Pythium (product), a brand new FRAC code, Serata. It\u2019s been in the market for a season, we\u2019ve had a really good response. But we\u2019re here because of you. We\u2019re investing in the industry. Since 2020 we\u2019ve donated $110,000 back to local chapters. We believe in a strong relationship between us and you, the end user.\u201d For more: FMCProSolutions.com The company: Bernhard and Co. What: Reel grinders, bedknife grinders Who: Gary Ray, business development manager What he said: \u201cWe are the second-oldest equipment manufacturer in the turf business. We\u2019re a global company. But we also represent SubAir and TurfBreeze fans everywhere in the world, except for the U.S. Our mission is to provide education and to create better playing surfaces. We do an awful lot of education and support in training to achieve those things. We work alongside all of the industry partners \u2026 GCSAA, PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, USGA, PGA of America, we do a lot of tournament support \u2026 We also have a very good customer service support center. We basically have people positioned throughout the world so we can handle support on a 24-hour basis. We overnight all our parts to customers.\u201d For more: Bernhard.Co.UK The company: Sipcam Agro USA What: Coastal and ETQ product family Who: Todd Mason, senior director of sales and development What he said: \u201cSipcam is a 76-year-old privately held, Italian, family-owned company. We stand out because we have the ability to be a little bit more agile, maneuver a little bit quicker and hopefully bring things to the market faster \u2026 innovation, passion, experience, independence and discipline. ETQ was one of our product lines, our enhanced turf quality products. Coastal, one of our newest herbicides, a warm-season product. \u2026 It\u2019s not just fungicides. It\u2019s not just insecticides. It\u2019s not just herbicides. It\u2019s biostimulants. It\u2019s bionutritionals. One thing that\u2019s nice is being a family-owned company out of Europe, we have access to things that are very much in the pipeline there because of the European Union and their regulatory restrictions.\u201d For more: SipcamAgroUSA.com The company: Nufarm What: Anuew PGR, Tourney EZ Who: Chris Fronczek, golf market manager What he said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re excited about at Nufarm in the next two, four, six years as we bring (new products) to the market to our customers. \u2026 Anuew is a popular late-stage GA-inhibiting growth regulator \u2026 we\u2019ll be moving over to a liquid formulation, as will Tourney EZ fungicide, a great cool-season, warm-season fungicide for some hard-to-control diseases, fairy ring in particular. Allstar is a four-way postemergent herbicide that will be coming out in summer \u2014 June or July 2023. Great on crabgrass, grassy weeds, sedges and hard-to-control broadleaf weeds. (Decide fungicide) we\u2019re waiting on EPA in this, but a third-generation SDHI that we\u2019re really excited about. This will be a foundation product to build on to combo products.\u201d For more: Nufarm.com\/USTurf The company: Jacobsen \/ Cushman What: Eclipse 360 Elite, AR530 Who: Josh Haggas, corporate accounts What he said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking our Eclipse 322, which I consider to be the best greens mower in the business, and making it completely lithium-ion (Eclipse 360 Elite). The AR530, our five-gang rotary mower \u2026 we\u2019ve made some great efficiency changes to that machine, some traction changes. We\u2019re taking lithium-ion into our fairway unit (with the Eclipse 360 Elite). It went up to over 70 holes on one charge with the lithium-ion placed in the unit. And they thought it could have been more, they just stopped counting at 70. Our (Electric Light Fairway) unit, which basically means we\u2019re taking lithium ion into the old LF5 series. \u2026 We have taken that lithium-ion into the Hauler Pro Elite and the Hauler Pro X Elite.\u201d For more: Jacobsen.com \/ Cushman.com The company: Kafka Granite What: Wax polymer pathway mix Who: Jason Chilson, sales representative What he said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide a solution to areas that we can offer a natural looking pavement or equivalent that also stands up to Mother Nature and address some of the main issues that you are all facing. There are different color options to fit your aesthetic needs. We address erosion issues in areas of heavy rains and drought areas and areas with high winds. We can minimize the amount of dust. The biggest thing for you is the reduced maintenance costs. It also works well with the environment. It\u2019s flexible. It\u2019s not going to crack and fall apart like a typical hardscape pavement. We took the same proprietary wax product, we manipulated the aggregate gradations and we made a bunker sand out of that. Your out-of-play bunker faces and your target bunker are great areas where you can put this material in.\u201d For more: KafkaGranite.com\/Golf The company: Husqvarna What: Automowers Who: Dave Plaster, director of business development and golf What he said: \u201c(Autonomous mowing) is where the technology in the industry is going. The best part about robots is that they never call in sick, so you don\u2019t have to worry about labor issues. They run 24\/7, rain or shine. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re taking away jobs from anybody. You\u2019re freeing up the labor that you had, and you can put it into more detailed work areas like greens and bunkers. Robotic mowing is not about event mowing, where you let the grass grow to a certain height and then cut it. With robotic mowing, you set the cut to a certain height and then maintain it forever.\u201d For more: Husqvarna.com\/US The company: Redexim What: Verti-Drain 2519 and Top-Brush 6000 Who: Darren Powers, eastern regional sales manager What he said: \u201cOur newest Verti-Drain aerator, called the 2519, is here at the Golfdom Summit. It\u2019s a deep-tine aerator that will go up to 10 inches deep to relieve compaction. You can put coring and solid tines in there \u2014 any tine you want, even down to pencil and bayonet tines. We\u2019ve also developed a 19-foot-wide top brush \u2014 the Top-Brush 6000. These brushes are really popular in Europe, and we\u2019ve brought them to the U.S. within the last year or so, and they\u2019re starting to gain popularity. A lot of people don\u2019t want to spray or can\u2019t spray for worms out on their course. This does a great job getting rid of worm castings, plus it\u2019s also great for removing dew and lifting up your turf.\u201d For more: Redexim.com The company: POGO Turf Pro What: POGO Turf Pro platform Who: Carmen Magro, president What he said: \u201cWe want to give you the confidence to make the best decisions possible. The platform collects key information that gives you a precise analysis to make the decisions that you have to make every single day. We measure soil, turf, weather, water and much more. You\u2019ll know if you\u2019re headed toward better conditions or away from them. We\u2019ve all been there where we go out on the course and think, \u2018Why can\u2019t I have it this way every day?\u2019 If you measure it, you can get to that point and maintain it over time. It\u2019s also a full-scale mapping platform. You can map anything with POGO. You can log wildlife and all of your irrigation assets. We\u2019ve even had courses in California that mapped out trees that they lost in fires for insurance claims.\u201d For more: PogoTurfPro.com Interested in attending the 2023 Golfdom Summit?

Adient was founded as a spin-off from Johnson Controls in 2016. Today, the company works with all major automakers and vehicle classes, and it operates some 200 assembly plants in 30 countries. One of those factories is a 125,000-square-foot plant in West Point, GA, where seats, door panels and other interior parts are assembled for the Kia Sorento. At the West Point factory\u2014like all Adient facilities\u2014things can change at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cCustomers are always reconfiguring and adding new products and updating standards. To keep up and stay competitive, our plants must be flexible and efficient,\u201d says Todd Emmons, an engineer in the automotive business unit for Adient. Indeed, flexibility and efficiency were top of mind when Adient, then part of Johnson Controls, began building the plant in 2009. Engineers set out to design a state-of-the-art assembly plant that could accommodate the ever-evolving demands of the automotive industry. \u201cOur plan was to equip the plant with the most reliable, functional, cost-effective and reusable technology possible,\u201d says Emmons. \u201cFlow Cell workstations from UNEX Manufacturing helped us deliver on that plan.\u201d Gearing Up For The Future At the plant, employees assemble seats, door panels and other interior parts for the new Kia Sorento. Subassemblies for some 500 cars a day move through the facility. \u201cThis is a high-volume plant. We\u2019re completing 55 jobs an hour, and the goal is to step that up to 60 jobs an hour,\u201d says Emmons. \u201cEvery minute counts, and every inch of workspace does too.\u201d In designing the plant, Emmons worked with John Maicki, president of DR Storage Systems, to identify the line-side assembly technology that would best fit current and future production needs. \u201cThe Adient team had very specific requirements. They wanted something durable, ergonomically sound and capable of accommodating the various product sizes on the production line,\u201d says Maicki. \u201cMost important, they needed an assembly line product that could be moved, adjusted and reused as production demands changed.\u201d In the past, tubular pipe structures had been used on assembly lines in some plants, but Emmons and Maicki agreed they would not be effective for the Georgia plant. \u201cTube and joint structures are highly customized and difficult to move from station to station. So, if the materials change on the assembly line, you have to order completely new racks and install them. This takes time and money,\u201d says Maicki. A better alternative came from UNEX. \u201cWe did a thorough analysis of the line-side racks available, got quotes from several vendors and had prototypes developed. Our decision was based on what was best in terms of reliability, cost-effectiveness, functionality and reusability. Flow Cell was the obvious choice,\u201d says Emmons. Efficiency Takes A Front Seat The Flow Cell units offer many benefits for the plant, including: Efficient use of space. \u201cWe only have 84 inches of pick space per workstation,\u201d says Emmons. \u201cThe Flow Cells are built in such a way that we never waste an inch of space. And UNEX\u2019s Flow Bed carton flow accommodates a variety a variety of materials, whether we are working with seats, door handles, power controls, air bags and the many different types of brackets and buttons. \u201d Uninterrupted work flow. \u201cOur Georgia plant is a just-in-time operation,\u201d explains Emmons. \u201cWe have to keep things moving without interruption, so that we can deliver product exactly when the nearby Kia facility is ready for it. The Flow Cells are configured in such a way that productivity remains high. And if we need to reconfigure the carton flow beds, it\u2019s simple to do. In fact, reconfiguring the Flow Cells is three times faster than reconfiguring other types of products.\u201d Reusability. \u201cThis is the biggest benefit,\u201d notes Emmons. \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll be adding new car parts to the line for other types of vehicles. We can simply pick up the Flow Cells, move them to another place in the plant or another new location entirely, and reconfigure them. There\u2019s no need to buy new racks.\u201d Added value. \u201cThe more efficient we can make the process, the more value we can offer customers, and that translates into more products for our operations,\u201d says Emmons. Both Emmons and Maicki have a long history with UNEX. \u201cWe\u2019ve used other UNEX products in our plants, and UNEX was the clear choice for the Georgia facility,\u201d says Emmons. \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve ordered 41 Flow Cells and used the UNEX instructions to assemble them in less than a half an hour each.\u201d Maicki adds, \u201cI first recommended Flow Cell to a customer in 2003, and I\u2019ve been recommending it ever since.

To overcome profitability and product development challenges during the next decade, companies need to invest in research and development, improve volumetric energy density and address supply chain issues. Due to unprecedented demand for batteries, the next decade will witness phenomenal growth. In fact, the compound annual growth rate for the global battery market is projected to reach more than 14 percent by 2027, while the battery-electric vehicle market is forecast to exceed $300 billion during the same time period. Globally, the lithium-ion battery market, currently valued at more than $41 billion, will skyrocket to more than $116 billion by 2030. The number of EVs in use worldwide surpassed 10 million in 2020. But, battery demand will soon exceed current production capacity. This monumental growth is fueled by several factors, such as evolving environmental regulations, higher OEM sustainability targets and increased consumer demand. Historically, Japan and South Korea have been the two largest suppliers of the cells used in EVs sold in the United States. Poland and China are close behind, thanks to suppliers of popular vehicles such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Tesla Model Y. But, that market share will shift dramatically by the end of this decade. According to a recent report conducted by Argonne National Laboratory, a wave of new planned EV battery plants will increase North America\u2019s battery manufacturing capacity from 55 gigawatt-hours per year (GWh\/year) in 2021 to nearly 1,000 GWh\/year by 2030. Most of the announced battery plant projects are scheduled to begin production between 2025 and 2030. By 2030, this production capacity will be capable of supporting the manufacture of roughly 10 million to 13 million all-electric vehicles per year. To optimize supply chain logistics, many battery factories will be co-located with vehicle assembly plants. Most of the planned projects in the U.S. are concentrated along a north-south band from Michigan to Alabama. Based on current plans, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee will see the highest growth in battery manufacturing capacity. Four Common Mistakes There are four common mistakes that plague battery manufacturersand impede production: Failure or lack of research to develop new, safer and more efficient materials. Failure to improve volumetric energy density within a given footprint. Failure to adopt more efficient, proven production technology. Failure to recognize and address supply chain issues. While these mistakes present major challenges today, progress is being made and opportunities exist for industry collaboration that can deliver new solutions, new products and a bright future. To meet future marketplace demand, manufacturers need to research, identify and develop new materials and chemistries to create more powerful, longer lasting batteries. Due to the dominance of lithium-ion batteries, it is essential to first focus on the development of raw materials. One way to accomplish this is to use materials with the fewest unnecessary impurities, ensuring the development of a lithium-ion battery that will last the maximum number of cycles. This does not mean the materials must be impurity-free. In fact, some impurities can be helpful, while others can create catastrophic failures, which result in internal swelling, shorts and fires. For example, while the presence of a low amount of copper enhances the discharge rates of lithium-ion batteries, excess copper will decrease performance. Lithium ion offers fundamental advantages over other chemistries\u2014in particular, the lowest reduction potential of any element. This allows these batteries to have the highest possible cell potential. Lithium is also the third lightest element and has one of the smallest ionic radii of any single charged ion. That\u2019s two big reasons why these batteries have high gravimetric and volumetric capacity and power density. Although multivalent cations allow for higher charge capacity per ion, the additional charge significantly reduces their mobility. Given that ionic diffusion in the solid electrodes is often the rate-limiting factor for battery power performance, this presents an enormous hurdle for the development of such alternative chemistries. Beware of Dendrites Understanding the growth mechanism of lithium dendrites is important in improving battery performance and safety. A lithium-ion battery operating in abnormal conditions, such as overcharging or lower temperature charging, can lead to dangerous lithium dendrite growth or lithium plating. Lithium dendrites are metallic microstructures that form on the negative electrode during the charging process. They are formed when extra lithium ions accumulate on the anode surface and cannot be absorbed into the anode in time. Dendrites can cause short circuits and lead to catastrophic failures and even fires. They can also create a drop in energy capacity when they react with the electrolyte, causing it to decompose and trigger the loss of active lithium inside the battery. Lithium dendrite growth is influenced by several factors, including current density, temperature, electrolyte and electrolyte convection. These factors determine the electrolyte dynamics.. The continuous development of new chemistries, processes and procedures is the ideal way for manufacturers to protect market share and streamline production across a wider range of products and customers. For example, sodium and sulfur are ideal materials for future battery production, because they are less costly and more widely available than materials such as lithium and cobalt. Manufacturers must fund and carry out more research to identify and develop new materials that can maximize battery life and performance, while they eliminate or dramatically reduce potential safety issues created by the materials. Another way to overcome production and profitability challenges is to improve volumetric function of the battery, or its volumetric energy density. A battery with a higher energy density will be lighter and smaller than a similar capacity battery with lower energy density. High energy density batteries provide distinct advantages in two areas: operating portable electronics and transporting batteries to remote locations. Unlike energy density, power density defines how much power a battery can deliver on demand, while energy density defines how long the battery will perform under normal conditions. Further improvement can be provided by developing lithium-sulfur batteries to provide higher, safer levels of energy at significantly lower costs. Development of new chemistries, intellectual property and potentially new patents will provide opportunities to improve energy densities, lower production costs, boost profits and meet surging demand for batteries. How to Streamline Production One way to maximize battery production is to implement continuous process improvement and lean manufacturing techniques. Continuous improvement includes the ongoing collection of production data to improve processes instead of simply adapting old manufacturing processes to produce new-styled batteries. Using the same equipment and processes to serve multiple customers can easily result in lower production rates and lower quality products. Many battery manufacturers currently rely upon mechanical data gathering systems simply because they are less costly than implementing optical datum systems. However, mechanical systems have distinct limitations that can inhibit a manufacturer\u2019s ability to maximize production across multiple product lines efficiently. Ultimately, the worst possible scenario is a single battery module overheating due to a faulty connection that ignites the battery and an entire EV. Mechanical data gathering systems may not detect battery block placement errors, eliminating the possibility of intervention and positioning adjustments impacting downstream production and product quality. In addition, they do not collect data that would allow for ongoing process improvement. Optical systems differ from mechanical systems. They use optical sensors, cameras and 3D-like scanners to \u201csee\u201d the part location instead of simple mechanical measurements. Optical positioning systems enhance the battery manufacturing process by improving the ability of equipment to complete a specified process in the exact location required, even if the battery block is out of position. The system adapts to each battery block in the process and verifies accuracy before, during and after welding or other operations. This lowers cost in the long run by reducing the need for human inspection while boosting quality. Speed and quality of battery pack assembly are influenced by the precision of the measurement and welding methods used in the process. The quality of assembly in EV battery production is the cumulative impact of part tolerances, assembly features and welded joint quality. Because optical systems rely upon images, they can quickly be adapted to produce new types of batteries faster and at lower cost than changing a mechanical system. In addition, optical systems can easily be used in continuous process improvement to enhance manufacturing tolerances and product quality, while reducing downtime during product line changeovers. An Efficient Supply Chain Is Crucial The bulk of battery manufacturing occurs in Southeast Asia, which has resulted in an unbalanced supply chain. At the same time, raw materials for battery production worldwide are subject to changing geopolitical forces beyond the control of most individual companies. These combined forces impact the quantity and quality of materials in the supply chain and, ultimately, end products. It takes an inordinate amount of time to develop a fully efficient supply chain. Establishing supply chains for some materials, such as lithium-hydroxide, can take anywhere from three to seven years. The situation was worsened by the COVID pandemic and an already existing supply shortage. In the future, the best options for worldwide battery companies will be to work collaboratively to develop new supply sources, resolve supply chain issues and boost production. This requires the development of a stable, safe, high quality supply chain that enables manufacturers to double battery energy production levels in the next five years. Worldwide supplier diversification and strategic partnership are also key to individual company success. In response, some automakers and battery suppliers are forming alliances and localizing supply chains to ensure quality and availability. The global battery manufacturing industry clearly faces numerous challenges, the greatest of which is demand exceeding production capacity. As demand grows during the next decade, manufacturers must adopt a collaborative effort to research and develop new materials and battery types, maximize battery quality, develop new manufacturing processes and overcome supply chain issues. Only a complete transformation of the industry will ensure the stability of the marketplace while meeting rising demands.","filter_flag":1}
