Global Smart Cities Market to Reach $5.2 Trillion by 2030 In the changed post COVID-19 business landscape, the global market for Smart Cities estimated at US$998.7 Billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of US$5.2 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 22.9% over the analysis period 2022-2030. Hardware, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to record a 20.2% CAGR and reach US$2.4 Trillion by the end of the analysis period. Taking into account the ongoing post pandemic recovery, growth in the Software segment is readjusted to a revised 24.2% CAGR for the next 8-year period. The U.S. Market is Estimated at $296.9 Billion, While China is Forecast to Grow at 26% CAGR The Smart Cities market in the U.S. is estimated at US$296.9 Billion in the year 2022. China, the world's second largest economy, is forecast to reach a projected market size of US$823.1 Billion by the year 2030 trailing a CAGR of 26% over the analysis period 2022 to 2030. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 18.3% and 20.9% respectively over the 2022-2030 period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 24.6% CAGR. Looking Ahead to 2023 The global economy is at a critical crossroads with a number of interlocking challenges and crises running in parallel. The uncertainty around how Russia`s war on Ukraine will play out this year and the war`s role in creating global instability means that the trouble on the inflation front is not over yet. Food and fuel inflation will remain a persistent economic problem. Higher retail inflation will impact consumer confidence and spending. As governments combat inflation by raising interest rates, new job creation will slowdown and impact economic activity and growth. Lower capital expenditure is in the offing as companies go slow on investments, held back by inflation worries and weaker demand. With slower growth and high inflation, developed markets seem primed to enter into a recession. Fears of new COVID outbreaks and China's already uncertain post-pandemic path poses a real risk of the world experiencing more acute supply chain pain and manufacturing disruptions this year. Volatile financial markets, growing trade tensions, stricter regulatory environment and pressure to mainstream climate change into economic decisions will compound the complexity of challenges faced. Year 2023 is expected to be tough year for most markets, investors and consumers. Nevertheless, there is always opportunity for businesses and their leaders who can chart a path forward with resilience and adaptability. What`s New for 2023? Special coverage on Russia-Ukraine war; global inflation; easing of zero-Covid policy in China and its `bumpy` reopening; supply chain disruptions, global trade tensions; and risk of recession.

The United States is a major producer of dairy products, with total milk production estimated to reach over 200 billion pounds from over 9.2 million dairy cows nationwide. Dairy farmers use various techniques and technologies to raise healthy, productive cows, including robotic milking systems, improved feed rations, and precision agriculture. In the U.S., most dairy farms are concentrated in states like California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Idaho. These states produce most of the country\u2019s milk, cheese, butter, and other dairy products. The U.S. also ranks highly in global dairy exports, with approximately 8% of all international dairy exports originating in the U.S. The American dairy industry is highly regulated and requires farmers to adhere to strict standards. All producers must register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comply with state and federal regulations regarding animal welfare, food safety, and environmental stewardship. This helps ensure that products produced by U.S. dairy farmers are of the highest quality. In addition to traditional farms, the dairy industry also includes dairy processing facilities, which are responsible for the manufacturing and packaging dairy products. Dairy processors have invested in modernizing their operations, including the purchase of new equipment and technology. This ensures that products remain fresh and safe for consumers. Overall, the U.S. dairy industry is expected to continue its strong performance in 2023 as it enjoys a sustained level of consumer demand and ongoing technological advances. IMPORTANCE Dairy farming is a vital industry in the United States and will remain so in 2023.

The U.S. dairy sector produces more than 200 million metric tons of milk and over 6 million metric tons of cheese annually. As of 2018, the US was the fourth largest milk producer, behind India, China, and the E.U. In addition, the dairy industry is responsible for providing nutrition to millions of Americans each year; according to the USDA, 49 per cent of American children aged 2-19 consume milk daily. The U.S. dairy industry faces several challenges in the coming years, including a changing climate, rising production costs, and increased competition from other countries. To combat these issues, dairy farmers must focus on improving efficiency and productivity, using new technologies such as precision agriculture, robotic milking systems, and automated feeding systems. Additionally, farmers must continue to promote the health benefits of dairy products and work to develop innovative products to meet consumer needs. Overall, dairy farming remains a significant and growing sector of the U.S. economy, contributing to job growth, income generation, and food security nationwide.
