The power of gifting Gifting is a key purchase driver for the modern travelling shopper, and Ferrero recognizes the potential for the confectionery sector to deliver gifting products for consumers of all ages. Among the innovations showcased by Ferrero at the event were the travel retail exclusive Kinder Mix Koala, which combines a sweet treat with the iconic Kinder flavor, with a cuddly toy for younger travelers. The toy also combines both play and learning, with a QR code which gives users access to an augmented reality experience and educational content, to inspire young minds. Leveraging the power of iconic brands is at the heart of Ferrero\u2019s innovation journey and the company has further developed the Kinder offer in travel retail with the debut of the Kinder Chocolate Pencil Case, which takes the beloved brand beyond the confectionery sector to provide a beloved lifestyle offer. The pencil case can be personalized to suit each user, with children able to apply their photo and favorite stickers to create a gift for themselves. Finally, for younger shoppers, is the Kinder Surprise Paw Patrol. Created in partnership with the children\u2019s TV phenomenon, each pack contains 100% Paw Patrol toys, so younger shoppers can collect the whole set and carry them around in the specially-created suitcase-shaped pack. More grown up shoppers remain a vital part of Ferrero\u2019s plans for the travel retail sector and the company is leveraging the power of its famous and loved Rocher brand with the Rocher Iconic Gift tin. This brand new travel retail exclusive SKU features a premium golden tin of Ferrero Rocher ready to share with loved ones and presented in a stunning gifting tin that can be upcycled to create a beautiful decoration. Innovating in the biscuit category Last year, Ferrero announced its foray into the under-served biscuit category with the launch of La Biscotteria. This year in Cannes, the company showcased its new release, which puts a focus on creating memorable moments for the whole family. Kinderini is the first biscuit that is aimed at families travelling with young children and the playful designs create a fun sharing moment for all generations. This game-changing creation takes the heart of the iconic Kinder brand into the biscuit category to create engagement and excitement for younger shoppers, with the first Kinder experience available in a biscuit with friable dough. Each piece is crafted from high-quality ingredients, using state-of-the-art technology and imbued with both the Kinder taste and the brand\u2019s touch of fun in the eyes and mouth of the playful designs. The 18-face designs are crafted for fun family bonding moments and they are the focus of a digital campaign which has been rolled out alongside the launch. By accessing a dedicate gaming platform, shoppers can compete against friends and family to win by mimicking the face of their Kinderini as fast as possible. The offer for retail partners from La Biscotteria is also being further enhanced by the launch of Kinder Duo, Kinder Cards, and Kinder Happy Hippo. Creating a sustainable future Sustainability has never been more important to travelling shoppers than it is today, and Ferrero is working hard to create an offer which appeals to the sustainable demands of the company\u2019s travelling consumers. Everything the company does is guided by its four pillars: Protecting the environment, sustainably sourcing high quality ingredients, promoting responsible consumption, and empowering people. For this reason, all the brands presented novelties with a more sustainable approach. The new Ferrero Rocher Iconic Gift is presented in a premium tin, which, once the pralines are eaten, can be upcycled in many creative ways, giving it a new use and a new life. A QR code on the pack offers design and decoration suggestions to inspire consumers to create a gift that last. The Rocher brand has undergone an overhaul in sustainability packaging, with the T30 and T16 boxes now eco-designed from polypropylene (PP), which is an easier-to-recycle material and delivers the quality expected from the iconic brand, with its iconic transparency, but in a more sustainable format. The tins and packaging for the Kinder Mix Koala and Kinder Chocolate Pencil Case are also specially designed to be reused and loved after use to reduce waste. Furthermore, the new Kinder Surprise Paw Patrolcomes with a special cardboard suitcase with two re-use features: One side can be transformed into a diorama to display the toys, while the other can be used as a playset to create Paw Patrol stories. Ferrero Travel Markets General Manager Sergio Salvagno says: \u201cOur return to Cannes this year was a complete success and we were delighted to have the chance to share our new innovations and products with our partners around the world. Innovation and creating moments of joy are what we do at Ferrero and these new products, alongside our dedicated focus on sustainability and delivering memorable gifting experiences, will continue to enchant shoppers and drive growth for our partners in travel retail.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The company will use the funds to drive growth and further develop its retail partner programmes and Reboxed for business service. Technology consumption generates more than 50 million tonnes of e-waste every year, with each new device creating an average carbon footprint equivalent to 79kg of CO2. Consumers and retailers are increasingly turning to recommerce solutions to cut down CO2 emissions, with 22 million people in Britain considering buying a refurbished phone.

It offers premium refurbished and pre-owned devices including phones, laptops, tablets and smart watches through a \u201clike new\u201d experience that focuses on quality, consistency and a genuinely circular approach. Phil Kemish, Co-founder and CEO of Reboxed\u00ae, said: \u201cWe want to give everyone access to high quality, great value tech, with a flexible, hassle-free experience. Mounting ESG pressures means that businesses are looking for integrated solutions that will help them achieve their climate goals. Reboxed\u2019s sustainable services help businesses do just that.

Achieving sustainable development involves focusing on bioeconomy, which according to the FAO, involves the knowledge-based production and usage of biological resources, processes, and methods to offer goods and services sustainably across all economic sectors. This becomes essential for our future. The term \"bioeconomy\" has emerged as a key player in shaping the future of industry, agriculture, and environmental stewardship. But what exactly does bioeconomy entail, and why is it gaining increasing importance on the global stage? What is Bioeconomy The bioeconomy refers to the part of the economy that uses renewable biological resources from land and sea, such as crops, forests, fish, animals, and microorganisms, to produce food, health, materials, products, textiles, and energy. It involves the use of biotechnology and biomass in the production of goods, services, or energy. The bioeconomy is crosscutting, encompassing multiple sectors, in whole or in part, including agriculture, textiles, chemicals, and energy. An important aspect of the bioeconomy is understanding mechanisms and processes at the genetic, molecular, and genomic levels, and applying this understanding to create or improve industrial processes, develop new products and services, and produce new energy. Why is Bioeconomy Important? The bioeconomy is becoming increasingly important globally for several reasons: Sustainable Development: The bioeconomy proposes a sustainable and circular model that is key in the fight against climate change. It aims to reduce our dependence on fossil natural resources, prevent biodiversity loss, and create new economic growth and jobs in line with the principles of sustainable development. Economic Growth: Bioeconomy has enormous potential for creating millions of green jobs in rural and coastal regions, renewing and modernizing industrial fabrics, introducing innovations in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, and other industries. Food Security: Bioeconomy can play a crucial role in ensuring food security and reducing hydric stress. With the world\u2019s population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food will increase significantly. The bioeconomy can help meet this demand sustainably. Energy Production: Bioeconomy can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote renewable energies. Biomass, a renewable biological resource, can be used to produce bioenergy, which can serve as an alternative to fossil fuels. Climate Change Mitigation: The bioeconomy can play a key role in the fight against climate change. By promoting the use of renewable biological resources and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the bioeconomy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 2030 Agenda and SDGs A 2023 Sustainability paper proposes a research method to assess biodiversity value chains using ecological, economic, and social indicators. Using interviews with local Amazonian actors involved with the pirarucu fish species, the authors aim to understand its value chain dynamics and local community effects. The 2030 Agenda, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that can greatly benefit from the implementation of the bioeconomy. According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the bioeconomy intersects with the SDGs in four key areas: Poverty Alleviation, Food Security, and Equality: The bioeconomy can play a significant role in ending poverty, achieving zero hunger, and reducing inequalities. Clean Water, Sustainable Cities, and Responsible Consumption: The bioeconomy is closely linked to the goals of clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, and responsible consumption and production. Sustainable Industry, Infrastructure, and Economic Growth: The bioeconomy can drive the development of sustainable industry and infrastructure, promote economic growth, and create decent work opportunities. Health, Climate Action, and Ecosystem Preservation: The bioeconomy can contribute to health and well-being, climate action, and the preservation of underwater and terrestrial ecosystems.
