The IEA is reporting that today\u2019s clean energy investment across the globe of 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars will rise to roughly 2 trillion dollars, in only a few years. Continue reading below Our Featured Videos This incredible growth in investment in sustainable technologies will boost growth in the energy sector and in auto manufacturing with the transition to EVs. Plus, it will contribute to growth in available products in solar, hydrogen, nuclear and wind power. Related: Largest US offshore wind farm approved in Virginia How quickly is sustainable energy growing in the U.S.? China is currently dominating the production and trade of most clean energies currently, but the U.S.\u2019s recent Inflation Reduction Act and other energy bills are encouraging investment in U.S. energy infrastructure and clean energy manufacturing, so the U.S. is expected to become a major center of sustainable energy usage and manufacturing in the coming decade. Will current supply chain issues affect the growth of this budding sustainable industry? Here is the state of clean energy in the U.S., and where it is expected to go in the near future. The current state of clean energy in the U.S. The IEA\u2019s report referred to \u201cthe dawn of a new industrial age,\u201d and examined the state of manufacturing for wind turbines, heat pumps, batteries for electric vehicles, solar panels and electrolyzers for hydrogen power. The conclusion of the report was that \u201cthe global market for key mass-manufactured clean energy technologies\u201d will be worth about $650 billion per year by 2030, a more than three-fold increase in size from today\u2019s clean energy industry. And unlike previous reports from other outlets, this change is predicted to happen this decade, not half a century in the future. It is already happening now. \u201cThe related clean energy manufacturing jobs would more than double from 6 million today to nearly 14 million by 2030 and further rapid industrial and employment growth is expected in the following decades as transitions progress,\u201d the IEA said. For comparison, eight million is the same number of jobs lost in 2 years at the beginning of the Great Recession. In March of 2021, by contrast, there were eight million job openings available as the COVID-19 pandemic shuffled the job market to remote and more flexible work arrangements, the peak of demand for talent. That\u2019s a lot of jobs. Diversifying the supply chain for clean technologies would help bolster and protect the growth of the clean energy industry. But there are other challenges to this new industry\u2019s rapid rise. Challenges to clean energy industry growth A notable recent challenge surely is still the supply chain instability. Disruptions to supply chains have been legendary in recent years due to COVID-19 disrupting manufacturing supply lines and facility operations. The IEA report warned of \u201cpotentially risky levels of concentration in clean energy supply chains \u2014 both for the manufacturing of technologies and the materials on which they rely.\u201d The U.S. also will see China as a competitor for production of clean energy technologies and market control of global energy consumers, as it currently dominates 70% of both clean production and clean energy markets. World leaders have focused on their own country\u2019s plans for energy independence, rather than working together globally to solve climate change. Competitive markets, while great for inspiring competitive product development, waste a lot of time and resources when countries need to compete over energy market control rather than collaborate. As climate change worsens, it is likely to cause more civil unrest, which further complicates the issue. Also problematic is the mining for rare minerals and metals critical to current battery technology to power clean energy devices. This mining is concentrated in a small number of countries, which leads to instability in the supply chain if mining runs dry or is interrupted by natural disasters or geopolitical conflict. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces over 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, and just three countries \u2014 Australia, Chile and China \u2014 account for more than 90% of global lithium production. What could help in this case is the development of technologies that don\u2019t rely on rare materials, the science to synthesize needed materials, or the improvement of battery technologies to be more efficient, which is in progress. what could change in the new industrial age So where do we go in the new industrial age? Clean energy is predicted to change nearly everything about how we live, which isn\u2019t a bad comparison with the last century\u2019s rise of factories, the automobile, and unionized workers. Clean energy will change everything: the balance of global power, the way we move and cook and harvest electricity, how interdependent we are and our awareness of our impact on the planet. Here\u2019s to hoping that the new industrial age will look like flying cars that make not one speck of pollution. It really could be coming this time. Maybe by 2030?

We discussed the company's history and what it hoped to achieve at the show this year. Please can you introduce yourself and your professional background? I have been involved in specialized chemical research for over 40 years. In 1992, I founded Swancor, which is dedicated to the R&D, manufacturing, and sales of environmentally friendly and green energy materials, leading the market in China and Taiwan. Subsequently, as a pioneer offshore wind power industry in Taiwan, we invested in Taiwanese offshore wind power development. In 2017, I was selected as one of the top 100 influencers in global wind power generation by the European wind power media, \"A WORD ABOUT WIND.\" In early 2022, we launched a revolutionary, innovative product, the recyclable thermoset resin \"EzCiclo,\" which we have been researching for years. The first \" Recyclable Thermoset CFRP Composite Bike\" made by the Swancor team in collaboration with our partner \"GIGANTEX\" was also awarded the \"2023 JEC COMPOSITES INNOVATION AWARDS\" by JEC World this year. Swancor is a chemical manufacturing company that is continually developing to meet the needs of its customers. Could you please tell me more about the products and services that you offer? Swancor\u2019s products are divided into three categories. The first is environmentally friendly corrosion-resistant materials, which have excellent mechanical properties, chemical resistance, processability, high strength-to-weight ratio, and fatigue resistance. They are widely used in industries such as coal power plants, electronics, automotive, marine, pipelines, and sports industries. The second is environmentally friendly green energy materials, including resins and adhesives for wind turbine blades. These materials have excellent mechanical properties, suitable viscosity, good fiber wetting properties, and curing performance. The third is carbon fiber composites, including pultruded plates for wind turbine blade spar caps, thermoplastic epoxy sheets for the 3C and sports industries, and prepreg for industrial applications. Most importantly, Swancor has developed revolutionary, innovative products, the recyclable thermosetting materials \"EzCiclo\" and \"CleaVER,\" which provide a new and effective solution to the previously unsolvable recycling problem. How large is Swancor, and what does its research and development look like? Swancor has 30 years of resin development experience and production capacity in Taiwan, China, and Malaysia. Our products sell worldwide, and we achieved a revenue of \u20ac311 million in 2022. Swancor has 660 employees, with 10% focused on research and development. Two years ago, Swancor launched SWANCOR HYVER, a resin with cost advantages and performance characteristics suitable for wind power, yacht, pultrusion, SMC\/BMC, and large structural composite parts manufacture. In 2022, Swancor launched recyclable thermosetting materials, \"EzCiclo\" and \"CleaVER\", which can reclaim both fibers and resins without generating waste solvents, emissions, or pollution (acid, alkali). \"EzCiclo\" and \"CleaVER\" are reusable, safe (compliant with EHS regulations), and have a wide range of applications, including wind turbine blades, sports, and automotive industries, and Swancor is active to expand the application in PCB and other fields. What industries do you supply to the most? Swancor's products can be widely used in various industries, such as wind turbine blades, marine, sports, rail transportation, electronics, large storage tanks and pipelines, and industrial anti-corrosion application. You have expanded into a carbon fiber composite business as well. Could you tell me more about your composite manufacturing? In 2015, Swancor and Formosa Plastics Group jointly established Sunwell Carbon Fiber Composite Material (SWCFC). Sunwell combines Swancor's resin capabilities with Formosa Plastics' carbon fiber supply to provide carbon fiber composite material solutions. Editor Skyla Baily interviews Chairman Robert Tsai at JEC World 2023 Currently, Sunwell has factories and R&D centers in Nantou, Taiwan, and Jiangsu, China. We specialize in the development and production of prepreg, thermoplastic epoxy resin sheets, and carbon fiber\/glass fiber components. They are now supplying carbon pultrusion plates to global wind turbine manufacturers for the production of large wind turbine blades over 70 meters long. In 2022, we further acquired Cotech Inc., which has complete composite material structure design, analysis, and manufacturing capabilities. It has AS9100D aerospace certification and IATF 16949 automotive certification. Its core technology is using autocalve process to produce aviation parts and automotive parts. Why should people pay attention to composites, and carbon fiber composites in particular? Composite materials, including carbon fiber composites, have many advantages compared to traditional materials. They have advantages such as high strength-to-weight ratio (lightweight and strong), corrosion resistance, design flexibility, durability, reduced maintenance, and improved energy efficiency. They are widely used in various industries, such as aviation, wind power, defense, sports and leisure, and transportation. You exhibited this April at JEC World \u2013 The Leading International Composites Trade Show. Why do you think it is important for Swancor to engage with this show? JEC World is the largest composite materials exhibition in Europe and even in the world. It is a global professional event for academic and product displays of composite materials, reflecting the latest technologies and application achievements in the industry. Exhibiting companies come from all over the world, and this year, Swancor brings revolutionary products, EzCiclo and CleaVER, which can solve the recycling issues of thermoset composites worldwide, making their presence indispensable. Editor Skyla Baily and Digital Marketing Consultant Ifeyinwan Isibor from AZoNetwork meet Chairman Robert Tsai, Senior Marketing Manager Jessica Weng, and the rest of the Swancor team at JEC World 2023. Why do you believe in-person trade shows and conferences like this are significant? Swancor has been participating in the JEC WORLD for over 20 years, and we deeply appreciate its importance in the materials industry. Although Swancor has distributors in many countries around the world, we value our customers' needs, feedback, and after-sales service highly. In addition to online meetings with our customers and distributors, we believe that face-to-face discussions and sitting down with customers for exchanges can enhance mutual cooperation. This occasion is also an opportunity for us to share Swancor's latest products and services and to understand our customers' short, medium, and long-term plans, so that the services we provide are more in line with the needs of this industry. How does Swancor plan to grow in the coming years? Swancor continues to deepen and develop our presence in the fields of environmental protection and green energy. Furthermore, Swancor is undergoing a transformation towards a goal of being \"devoted to carbon neutrality and new materials innovation,\" which includes new products and businesses related to the circular economy, such as \u201cEzCiclo\u201d and \u201cCleaVER\u201d as well as upcoming low-carbon recycling technologies for carbon fiber, microwave heating recycling of carbon fiber and CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage). In addition to the applications in wind turbine blades and the sports industry, \u201cEzCiclo\u201d is also being utilized in other industries such as PCB and aerospace for the circular economy application of composite materials. Do you have any exciting developments on the horizon you want to tell us about? \"EzCiclo\" has not only won numerous innovation awards but has also recently collaborated with wind turbine manufacturers to successfully produce recyclable wind turbine blades. The verification of degradation and recycling has also been achieved for bicycles. Swancor has already established a recycling demonstration line in Taiwan, which can process 40 tons of recycled composite materials per year. We plan to establish a recycling demonstration line in China in 2024, which can process 2,000 tons of recycled composite materials per year. Swancor wants to find partners in Europe for circular economy initiatives. About Robert Tsai Robert Tsai has been involved in specialized chemical research for over 40 years.

(Image: Elizabeth Gottwald \/Unsplash) Forestation is an important climate action strategy, but more sophisticated \u2014 and potentially more efficient \u2014 nature-based alternatives are emerging. One of them involves an environmental two-for-one: capturing carbon by preventing destructive blue-green algae blooms. Cyanobacteria and algae blooms Blue-green algae is the common name for cyanobacteria, a type of water-dwelling bacteria that has plant-like photosynthetic abilities. An over-abundance or \u201cbloom\u201d of cyanobacteria can wreck ecosystems and harm other living things. \u201cA combination of environmental factors such as the presence of nutrients, warm temperatures, and lots of light encourage the natural increase in the numbers of cyanobacteria,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In higher concentrations, the toxins produced by some cyanobacteria can damage the liver, nerves, and skin of humans and other creatures, including pets and livestock as well as wildlife. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes that warmer temperatures and other climate impacts affect the frequency and severity of algae blooms. Blue-green algae blooms in particular are a frequent occurrence in all 50 U.S. states and elsewhere in the world. They mainly occur on inland waters, but they can also happen in the open ocean. Putting \u201cbad\u201d algae to good use On the plus side, cyanobacteria are emerging as a clean technology jack-of-all-trades, partly because they are fast-growing, voracious consumers of carbon dioxide. Researchers have tweaked cyanobacteria to produce renewable hydrogen and other biofuels, for example. Cyanobacteria are also attracting attention for their ability to convert airborne carbon to a solid substance. They have been linked to deposits of the mineral carbonate, a salt of carbonic acid. The \u201cbiomineralization\u201d process carried out by cyanobacteria was formerly thought to occur as a result of outside factors. However, 2014 research concluded that some strains are capable of producing carbonate on their own. In 2020, researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder put the biomineralization concept to work. They demonstrated that, under the right growing conditions, certain types of cyanobacteria can produce calcium carbonate, which happens to be the main ingredient in cement. The research team tested their method on a growing medium of sand and gelatin. As the cyanobacteria produced calcium carbonate, they mineralized the gelatin and bound the sand into a bio-manufactured brick. Blue-green algae blooms swirling around the Baltic Sea in 2019, as seen from space. (Image: European Space Agency\/Flickr) Algae remediation and carbon offsets Regardless of the potential use cases for cyanobacteria-produced carbonate, algae blooms must be treated and prevented in order to protect aquatic habitats and human health. BlueGreen Water Technologies is among those developing algaecides that specifically tackle cyanobacteria. Its patented, EPA-approved formula triggers a natural \u201csuicide\u201d response in cyanobacteria, clearing the way for beneficial algae and other aquatic species to take over. The treatment effectively converts a body of water into a carbon sink, with the dead cyanobacteria locked into sediment for potentially millions of years, according to BlueGreen. This carbon-sequestering feature could help offset the cost of remediating blue-green algae blooms, if stakeholders could claim carbon credits for the operation. The challenge is to develop a methodology that produces a science-based estimate of the captured carbon. Scientific verification for cyanobacteria remediation In March, BlueGreen received approval from the Social Carbon Foundation for its carbon quantification methodology, under the proprietary name Net Blue. Social Carbon manages the trademarked greenhouse gas standard by the same name. \u201cNet Blue is the first deep water, nature-based climate solution for atmospheric carbon removal that is regulatory approved, scientifically validated and, now, verifiable by industry standards,\u201d BlueGreen asserted in a March announcement. The company has been remediating cyanobacteria since 2019, for an estimated 3.3 million tons of carbon removal. With the Social Carbon standard in hand, BlueGreen can now market cyanobacteria remediation as a verifiable carbon offset. According to BlueGreen CEO Eval Harel, the worldwide potential for cyanobacteria remediation offsets adds up to about 115 gigatons of carbon. A blue-green algae bloom in Regent's Canal just north of London in 2019. (Image: Marc Barrot\/Flickr) Natural vs. unnatural carbon capture The emergence of verifiable cyanobacteria remediation credits should help meet the growing demand for carbon credits. The current demand for carbon credits already exceeds the supply, and BlueGreen projects a 15-fold increase in demand for carbon credits by 2030 and a 100-fold increase by 2050. Cyanobacteria remediation could also help further undercut the case for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS has been promoted as an effective pathway for preventing greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants and other industrial sources. However, the idea of capturing carbon and storing it in underground formations is rapidly losing currency. BlueGreen offers a fast-acting, scalable carbon capture system that requires no infrastructure. The algaecide can be deployed swiftly to provide additional benefits for local businesses and recreational users, as well as restore biodiversity and protect public health. In contrast, carbon capture and storage systems offer no such local add-on benefits, and their ability to scale up globally has yet to be proven. In particular, it is difficult to see how CCS infrastructure fits into the rapid decarbonization picture, due to its relatively high costs and long timeline for construction. Typically, CCS systems also require new pipelines to ship captured carbon from the source to a distant storage facility. That raises the threat of environmental impacts related to construction of the pipeline, as well as delays due to public opposition. The U.S. already has one massive carbon capture failure under its belt, the FutureGen CCS project in Illinois. It kicked off in 2003 with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, intended to provide a showcase for technology to capture and store carbon from a coal power plant. The project was abandoned in 2015. Since then, new alternatives have emerged in the field of carbon capture, utilization and storage systems (CCUS), which can convert captured carbon into new products that recycle or sequester it, at least temporarily. Recycled-carbon products also help reduce the need to draw virgin petrochemicals from underground. Fuels, fabrics, perfumes and vodka are among the new recycled-carbon products coming to market, made from carbon collected at industrial sources or drawn from ambient air by CCUS facilities. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects CCUS activity to pick up considerably in the coming years, from just 35 systems in operation globally today to an estimated 200 in the pipeline by 2030. What about the trees? Despite all the forthcoming activity, IEA does not foresee CCUS playing a leading role in the effort to achieve a net-zero economy. \u201cNevertheless\u2026 CCUS deployment would remain substantially below what is required\" for a net-zero scenario, IEA concluded in a 2022 report. The need remains for a broad expansion of swift, effective decarbonization pathways across the board. The Social Carbon Foundation is among those working to steer the decarbonization conversation into a more holistic framework that can achieve global progress on a larger scale. Through its Social Carbon standard, the organization advocates for nature-based decarbonization pathways that, like BlueGreen, provide local benefits. The localized nature of this approach requires the standard to be flexible and take political and social elements into account. \u201cProjects using our standard go beyond carbon, embedding meaningful social, environmental and economic benefits to the projects and their local stakeholders,\u201d Social Carbon's website reads. \u201cThe trademark communicates that emissions reductions result from efforts that benefit and improve living conditions for stakeholders involved in climate change projects, in ways that strengthen their welfare and civic consciousness without degrading their resources base,\u201d it continues. That reference to resources appears to be a cautionary note against tree-planting programs that focus on commercial timber plantations as a carbon sequestration tool, to the detriment of local habitat. Scientists have also raised concerns about the pace and efficiency of carbon capture through forestation. Planting trees is likely to continue to hold a place in the carbon market, but companies seeking to burnish their reputation with forestation will need to ensure that their projects adopt a holistic approach that supports local communities.","filter_flag":1}

Delta Electronics\u2019 Americas Headquarters Becomes First LEED Zero Energy-Certified Green Building in Fremont, California Delta, a global provider of IoT-based smart green solutions, has announced its Americas regional headquarters (HQs) has become the first green building in Fremont, CA, and second in the Silicon Valley Bay Area, to achieve the LEED Zero Energy certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The accolade, granted to green buildings that generate as much electricity as they consume, has been attained thanks to the further implementation of Delta\u2019s own solutions on this originally LEED Platinum facility. A new solar PV carport, supported by a 330kWh Delta energy storage system, now helps to increase the building\u2019s annual green electricity generation to over 1.4 million kWh. With 32 green buildings(1) enabled worldwide, Delta\u2019s solutions are nurturing sustainable cities. \u201cJust as Fremont leads the way in clean technology, Delta Electronics continues to set the industry standard for building performance. The company\u2019s built-to-suit Americas HQ in Fremont previously laid claim to being one of the earliest private sector LEED Platinum facilities in California. Today, Delta Electronics sets another milestone as only the second facility in the entire Bay Area to achieve LEED Zero-Energy,\" said Lily Mei, mayor of Fremont. She added, \u201cAs one of the greenest cities in the nation, we're proud that Delta Electronics continues to showcase sustainability through thoughtful application of technology, including using its Fremont facility as a proving grounds for many of its own products while working through pandemic disruptions to invest even further in our community.\u201d Kelvin Huang, president of Delta Electronics (Americas), said, \u201cFremont has been Delta\u2019s home in the Americas for over 30 years, so it is an honor for us to contribute to our community with the environmental and social benefits of the city\u2019s very first LEED Zero Energy green building. With its net-zero energy capabilities, our Americas HQs green building will contribute even further to Delta\u2019s RE100 initiative, which is a promise to power our worldwide operations with renewable electricity by 2030. By developing smart energy-saving solutions capable of fostering green buildings and sustainable cities, Delta demonstrates that its ESG-embedded business model can bolster mankind\u2019s environmental goals.\u201d Aided with an energy-conscious design that utilizes geographical advantages unique to Fremont while considering the productivity and needs of its operations, the Delta Americas HQs building is an example of what a total integrated solution can look like. The most recent upgrades made possible with Delta\u2019s own IoT-based Smart Green Solutions are: The facility generates over 1.4 million kWh of renewable electricity through a 616kW rooftop solar PV system and a recently constructed 504kW bi-facial PV carport system, both supported by Delta\u2019s high-efficiency PV inverters. That green energy output covers 100% of its consumption needs over a full calendar year. The recent addition of a 330 kWh Delta energy storage system helps to optimize energy management in the facility. A recent enhancement of Delta\u2019s data center cooling solution, featuring a dedicated economizer supported by our own DC brushless electronically commutated (EC) fans and variable frequency drives for HVAC applications, have contributed significantly in lowering the annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the building\u2019s data center from 1.5 originally to as low as 1.25. Optimized energy management is also attained by the implementation of Delta\u2019s next-generation SCADA system and building control platform. The former is VTScada, the industry\u2019s most powerful SCADA system, developed by Canadian-based Trihedral, a Delta Group Company; the latter is the enteliWEB building control platform, developed by Canadian-based Delta Controls, also a Delta Group Company. These platforms integrate seamlessly with the existing building sub-systems, such as HVAC, LED lighting and other energy-intensive applications, to create set points, collect data and track trends, create reports, and manage alarms, remotely. With unlimited scalability, this solution grows with the facility as new solutions are integrated to ensure lower energy consumption. Here are some of the original integrated solutions that made Delta Americas\u2019 HQs a LEED Platinum green building back in 2018, and that have certainly contributed to the new LEED Zero Energy certification: HVAC Host to one of the largest geothermal systems in Silicon Valley, Delta\u2019s unique location in the Bay Area takes advantage of the natural underground warm springs. With over 20 miles of horizontal piping at 15 and 30 feet depths, a Delta VFD circulates water in a closed-loop system to exchange heat for an HVAC system estimated to be 70% more efficient than a cooling tower. 92 miles of piping is embedded in the facility\u2019s floors and ceilings for radiant heating and cooling, providing stable and comfortable temperatures, efficiently. Working in collaboration with CBE Berkeley, this system has been a case study to determine optimal operations and controls for maximum energy efficiency. Lighting With LED lighting systems in the parking lot and around the office, Delta\u2019s lighting controls integrates with its building management system to ensure smooth operations at all hours. Taking advantage of the floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows, the open floor plan, and low-e windows, zones are created to minimize waste from excessive lighting. Light meters placed around the office ensure sufficient light-levels for safety and productivity.

This was the point in time when solar and wind energy became cheaper to produce than traditional energy. 2023 is the year that municipalities invested heavily in a clean energy future, setting the stage for a majority of U.S. energy to be from renewable sources in the next couple of decades. What are the clean energy trends driving this sea change to a sustainable future? Here are our top picks for clean energy trends to watch in 2023. Continue reading below Our Featured Videos EV sales skyrocket with one million sold Electric cars are finally taking off, with over one million sold in the U.S. for the first time in 2023. Even though only 40% of Americans say their next car will be an EV, the interest in electric vehicles is going mainstream for the first time. Related: Hydrogen made of biomass revolutionizes clean energy And there are finally plenty of options of EVs to purchase, though the price of cars has been a challenge due to recent near double-digit inflation. Bloomberg is predicting that more Americans will drive EVs than will drive ICE cars by 2030, which means the EV revolution is happening this decade. We are in it now. Offshore wind takes flight In 2023, the U.S.\u2019s first large-scale offshore wind farms are coming online. The U.S. currently only has two operational offshore wind farms, in Rhode Island and Virginia, with a total of seven turbines and capacity of 42 megawatts. It\u2019s not a very significant contribution to the grid. By the end of the year, the first of a new set of gigantic offshore wind farms should be close to operational in the U.S. Vineyard Wind 1 will be located off of Massachusetts, with 800 megawatt capacity, and South Fork Wind will be located off of New York with 132 megawatt capacity. BloombergNEF reports another 5,400 megawatts are on track to finalize financing or begin construction in 2023. As solar and wind power continue to become less expensive than traditional alternative fuels to produce, we expect this to be the turning point when wind power really took off. Legislation changes the world Well, that\u2019s not a headline we thought we would write, to be honest, but the U.S. government and other world governments deserve their props for what climate-targeted legislation they can produce to save the world in time to avoid catastrophic climate change. State lawmakers in Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Minnesota are preparing to pass climate and clean energy legislation. The Inflation Reduction Act is driving heavy investment in U.S. manufacturing for the first time in decades for the sake of EV tax credits and other incentives. It comes at a time when clean technologies can power plants and produce sustainable products for the first time in modern history. According to the International Monetary Fund, the IRA is the most significant piece of climate legislation ever created in U.S. history, funneling $400 billion into climate change mitigation projects over the next decade. Managed correctly, the recent climate bills could shift the course of history. The headwinds against wind power The Inflation Reduction Act barely passed in 2022. Political instability and rancor in the U.S. continues to threaten climate goals that affect the entire world. But there are good signs that this time wind power is really here to stay. The IRA contains about $370 billion in tax credits and incentives for renewable energy and EVs, including extra incentives for companies making clean energy technology in the U.S. Where recent years have been dominated by partisan politics, now state governments are racing to meet climate objectives and realizing it pays to work together to build the heart of the sustainable energy industry in the U.S. for the next generation. \u201cCongress has an important role to play in guiding the swift and effective implementation of the IRA,\u201d said Jose Zayas, executive vice president of policy and programs for the American Council on Renewable Energy, a trade group. \u201cThe Treasury Department is still issuing guidance related to key provisions, which will have crucial implications for developers and homeowners seeking to take advantage of a suite of new clean energy tax credits. Congress must use its oversight authority to ensure prompt completion of guidance from Treasury.\u201d In other words, the final challenge is implementation. Can these programs live up to their promises? While battery technology develops the capacity to power the future and more clean energy plants are pushed through financing and permitting, how we roll out our climate-oriented programs over the next decade will in part direct the course of history as we struggle into a sustainable future.

Emissions decreased by 2% from the electricity generation sector. The decrease in industrial emissions is over 7%, with the cement industry emissions decreasing by almost 9%. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as the Competent Authority in Ireland for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), released its preliminary analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 from the ETS sector. Emissions from Irish power generation and industrial companies decreased by 4% (more than 600.000 tonnes) in 2022. This compares with a decrease of approximately 1.2% across Europe, according to preliminary analysis by carbon analysts of the data released today by the EU Commission. Ireland\u2019s ETS sector delivered a decrease in emissions in 2022 due to a combination of factors, including increased use of renewable electricity and renewable fuels as well as a decrease in cement production. In the electricity sector, there was less use of coal and peat-fired generation compared to the previous year, as conventional gas generation was available along with renewable energy. Fossil-fired power stations continued to play a strong role in meeting a high electricity demand. Laura Burke, Director General, Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWhile the decrease we are seeing for 2022 from the emissions trading sector is welcome, 2022 emissions are in fact slightly above the pre-pandemic levels in 2019,\u201d said Laura Burke, EPA Director General. \u201cMuch more needs to be done if the sectoral targets under the 2023 Climate Action Plan are to be reached. The challenges faced in the power generation sector are in sharp focus at the moment. Decisions taken now must recognise the urgency of the climate change challenge and support the delivery of reductions in emissions through the development and roll out of a range of low carbon and renewable solutions.\u201d Energy Industries show a decrease in emissions of 9.4% over the period 1990 to 2021. Over the time series, emissions from electricity generation have decreased by 10.5% whereas total electricity consumption has increased by 150.5%. Emissions from electricity generation increased from 1990 to 2001 by 54.3% and have decreased by 42.1% between 2001 and 2021. This decrease reflects the improvement in efficiency of modern gas-fired power plants replacing older peat and oil-fired plants and the increased share of renewables, primarily, wind power along with increased interconnectivity. This year was the lowest year in the 32-year time series for peat-fired electricity generation, 68% less than in 2020. These reductions reflect the gradual ending of peat-fired electricity generation for market and climate policy reasons. Emissions from electricity generation had decreased year-on-year from 2016 to 2020, but 2021 has seen an increase of 18.8% compared to 2020. In 2021, there was a tripling of coal and oil used for electricity generation due to the unavailability of enough gas-fired generation and lower renewables. Emerging business heroes of Irish Renewables As Ireland continues it ongoing objective to reduce emissions, a wide cross-section of companies are heeding the call with innovative ideas and initiatives designed to tackle the challenge of climate change head-on. Some are large corporations with a variety of divisions, while others are nimble and focused start-ups \u2014 and all are committed to investing in Ireland's huge renewable energy potential. The following companies represent a broad cross-section of this important and growing sector \u2014 some are already household names, others are the stars of tomorrow. NOVOGRID NovoGrid is a pioneer in Grid Edge Intelligence software with a suite of patented software products which benefit electricity generators and utilities. Prof Andrew Keane of UCD and co-founder and chief technology officer of Novogrid, with Paul Manning, co-founder and chief commerical officer. The company has developed a number of novel control technologies for distributed generators and system operators allowing them to maximise the efficiency of their energy delivery without the need for extensive communications infrastructure. GridBoost is a patented grid edge intelligence software technology that automates and removes inefficiencies in renewable generators and electrical grid operations and was developed by Professor Andrew Keane and his team at University College Dublin. NovoGrid, a UCD spin-out company supported by NovaUCD, was established to commercialise the technology. Using Already installed in a number of wind farms in the UK, GridBoost could save 33 million kWh of renewable energy wasted annually, reducing carbon emissions by 16,200 tonnes and saving the Irish consumer \u20ac2.2 million. NVP ENERGY NVP Energy delivers efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment solution, providing a professional, end-to-end service covering all aspects of the project, from calculating the feasibility of the installation, to ensuring a detailed handover and training as well as providing an aftercare service tailored to specific needs. Its technology treats wastewater and produces energy in one efficient package, helping slash wastewater charges by up to 60%, has negligible sludge management costs and qualifies for renewable energy incentives. The combined effect results in an average return on investment of three years. TERRA SOLAR Terra Solar is at the forefront of solar energy development in Ireland, helping lead the way in developing renewable energy sources and increasing energy independence. The business exclusively develops, finances, constructs and operates solar farms on the island of Ireland, partnering with commercial enterprises and private landowners to identify suitable sites for solar development and subsequently bring those sites from planning and grid approval stage through to fully operational solar farms. Ireland\u2019s temperate climate is perfectly suited to the development of solar energy. While we do not benefit from the same level of sunshine as southern regions, our lower temperatures significantly improve the performance and lifetime of solar cells. Solar energy generation is as economically viable as wind energy generation in Ireland without suffering the same drawbacks from a construction and planning standpoint. NTR For two decades, NTR has invested in renewable energy and during that period has, through its associated companies, constructed and operated c.2GW of wind projects and 630MW of solar projects across Europe and the US. Since 2015, NTR has acquired and managed renewable energy investments on behalf of third party investors through its renewable energy funds. It recently announced the successful deployment of two Battery Storage Systems in Co Wexford. Gorey battery storage 9MW and Avonbeg battery storage 16 MW are contracted to provide DS3 services to EirGrid. The batteries are critical in enabling the transmission system operator to increase the levels of renewable energy on the Irish grid system. Both the Gorey and Avonbeg facilities have also achieved capacity market contracts, highlighting the increasing demand for energy storage solutions as renewable energy sources become more prevalent. SEABASED Seabased\u2019s proprietary technology generates stable and predictable power that enables grid operators to increase the amount of renewables they can incorporate into the energy mix, either through stand-alone wave parks or in combination with other renewables such as offshore wind. The company has committed itself to solving the challenges standing between wave power\u2019s tremendous potential and cost-effective implementation. Its scientists and engineers have amassed more than 300 patents and 20 PhD theses; developing and ocean testing full-scale generators in four countries, including two multi-generator grid-connected demonstration wave power park. It is currently planning a 10-MW wave power park in Tongatapu in the South Pacific island country of Tonga, designed to tackle high energy costs. An initial 2-MW phase is expected to save Tonga \u20ac1.87m, replace two million litres of fuel and provide enough power for 2,800 homes. The second phase will add a further 8 MW. It is projected to meet half Tonga\u2019s energy needs and reduce emissions by 20%. GAZELLE WIND POWER Gazelle Wind Power Limited is unlocking the massive deep-water offshore wind market to achieve global decarbonisation. The company\u2019s durable, disruptive hybrid floating platform with a high stability attenuated pitch surmounts the current barriers of buoyancy and geographic limitations while reducing costs and preserving fragile marine environments. Gazelle Wind Power\u2019s innovative, stable, hybrid attenuated mooring platform allows for a 70% reduction in the weight of steel, while delivering significant cost savings. The company is based in Dublin and has a presence in Dubai, London, Madrid, Paris, and Texas. Offshore wind projects have traditionally lagged behind onshore and other renewable energy projects, with costs of construction, installation, and maintenance hindering their widespread adoption. Gazelle Wind Power\u2019s innovative, stable, hybrid attenuated mooring platform is designed and engineered by leading naval engineers to enable floating offshore wind production in deeper waters farther out at sea. The patented design allows for a 70% reduction in the weight of steel, while delivering a highly stable platform together with a 30% cost reduction compared to other floating wind platforms. OBELISK Obelisk is an internationally competitive professional engineering services business providing infrastructure solutions for the telecoms and power sectors in Ireland, UK and Africa. Founded in 1996, it employs over 300 people across office locations in Dublin, Cavan and Cape Town. The company\u2019s core activity is in providing solutions and resources to telecoms, power transmission and distribution, renewable energy and tower infrastructure industries. At present, Obelisk are testing out a fleet of electric vehicles, as part of the EV Commercial Fleet Trial \u2014 a pilot scheme run by SEAI on behalf of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland - providing businesses with the opportunity to trial battery electric vehicles as part of their day-to-day jobs, to showcase the cost and emissions savings that an EV fleet can offer. Obelick plans the electrification of its commercial fleet, with the goal of eradicating 98% of Scope 1 emissions. BORD NA MONA Bord na M\u00f3na is a semi-state climate solutions company helping lead Ireland towards a climate-neutral future. It provides employment for approximately 1500 people and manages a land holding of over 80,000 hectares. Its ambition is to create the right conditions to store carbon and protect biodiversity, while helping to deliver ongoing sustainable energy security for Ireland. The company works across wind, solar, biomass and biogas to power the national grid with clean energy. Many of Ireland\u2019s wind turbines are installed on cutaway bogs - lands that were once harvested for peat but are now being rehabilitated for renewable energy infrastructure, biodiversity and public enjoyment. Returning 8,000 hectares of raised bogs to their natural state will help absorb carbon from the atmosphere - this stops further release of carbon dioxide and, in time, enables the bog to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. SOLAR ELECTRIC Solar Electric, as one of the leading companies offering Solar panels in Ireland, recently joined Pinergy, giving access to a strategic partnership with the most innovative and sustainable electricity providers in Ireland. The market for solar photovoltaic systems is growing rapidly. A greater understanding of the need to invest in renewables is coupled with the energy crisis, which has heightened financial drivers for cheaper energy. The removal of barriers to installing solar PV systems will kick-start even more rapid growth, following the 2022 government removal of the need for planning permission to put solar panels on roofs. A second impactful change was the introduction of the option to sell excess power back to a provider \u2014 a revenue stream that means the cost of installing a system can be retrieved far more quickly. WIND ENERGY IRELAND Wind Energy Ireland (WEI) is the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country\u2019s low-carbon energy future.

Defining the future energy system \u2013 A hybrid of old and new, the energy system will need to capitalize and build on existing sources of energy, interwoven with innovative solutions including electrification, clean hydrogen and renewables. An optimized mix combined with a central, national vision and action plan will help ease the transition and position us as leaders in sustainability for the future. 2. Improving public policy and regulatory frameworks \u2013 Having a national plan, with clear accountabilities and policies to ensure traction and forward progress and strategies to support capital allocation will be critical. Carbon levies, emissions caps and carbon offsetting capabilities can go a long way towards ensuring compliance and incentivizing progress. 3. Developing a funding mechanism \u2013 Investors have a way of unlocking potential. Public and private, blended financing and innovative ESG investment frameworks for energy transition enterprises will provide much-needed access to the capital needed to feed decarbonization agendas. 4. Educating and guiding consumer behaviour \u2013 According to EY\u2019s Future Consumer Index Survey, 61% of Canadians say they will pay more attention to the environmental impact of purchases, and 69% expect companies to solve sustainability issues. Making consumers aware of their impact can help them to make better choices and apply pressure with their spending dollars. 5. Activating corporate participation \u2013 Organizations should be invited to continue contributing to decarbonization efforts internally. Increased capital allocation and the introduction of disclosure and reporting standards may help encourage organizations to adopt new technologies and be more accountable for their own impact. Engaging diverse stakeholders and delivering on decarbonization targets will be near-impossible without three key enablers. Technology and innovation, while not solutions to the energy transition, will be critical tools and early and proactive investment in new and creative tools and processes will enable efficiencies and expedite industry\u2019s path to net-zero. Having humans at the centre of change with transformative leadership and tangible value delivered to stakeholders each step along the way will help sustain progress. And partnering through collaboration and sponsorships like Pathways Alliance \u2013 Canada's oil sands producers working together to address climate change \u2013 will help build awareness, distribute knowledge, invite participation and perhaps most importantly, ensure resources are available to see change through. Decarbonizing to avert climate crisis is a massive undertaking. While there are certainly gaps to overcome, Canada\u2019s role in energy transition holds significant promise. Our work with disclosures and clean technologies have us off to a good start. We\u2019ll need decisive action and the dedicated attention of government, industry, investors and citizens if we are to realize our decarbonization goals and move forward together for a more sustainable future.","filter_flag":1}
