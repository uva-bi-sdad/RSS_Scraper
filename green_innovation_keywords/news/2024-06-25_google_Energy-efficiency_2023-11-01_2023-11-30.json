This week, Signify issued a strong reminder of the basics, increasing the efficiency of LED lamps across a range of uses. The world\u2019s largest lighting company added models to its Philips brand Ultra Efficient (UE) line for use on roadways as well as in retail, hospitality, and home environments. Eindhoven, Holland\u2013based Signify said the new models increase energy efficiency over existing Signify Philips-branded LED products by between 43% and 50%, depending on the model. The new editions all have an \u201cA\u201d energy efficiency rating under the European Union eco labels that came into force in September 2021, when \u201cA\u201d replaced \u201cA++\u201d as the most energy-efficient designation, causing many existing products from Signify and other vendors to cascade down as low as E and F. It was around that time that Signify started adding Ultra Efficient models, beginning with some home LED lamps. The company has continued to beef up its UE stable since then. The most recent additions include a replacement for conventional high-intensity discharge (HID) street lamps. Signify said the new Philips MASTER LED SON-T UltraEfficient is 43% more efficient than its previous LED HID replacement offering. Signify also added new lamps for indoor use commercially and residentially that all qualify as \u201cA\u201d in E.U. energy ratings, whereas Signify previously topped out at \u201cB.\u201d The new models include Edison-style lightbulbs in various shapes such as traditional, candle, and globe \u2014 some of which are dimmable. They offer 50% greater energy savings than Signify\u2019s previous products. The new offerings also include GU10 spot lamps, with 45% greater efficiency. Signify did not reveal pricing. LEDs Magazine has inquired. Typically the company attaches a premium price tag when it offers a big leap in efficiency. The new products have been available in Europe since September; Signify has only now announced them. LEDs is awaiting answers on availability in other geographic areas. In the E.U.\u2019s September 2021 reconfigured labeling scheme, the top rating of A requires 210 lumens per watt (lm\/W), B means 185 lm\/W, and C 160 lm\/W. The designations run down to G at 0 lm\/W. The less stringent old system topped at A++ at 120 lm\/W, while A+ meant at least 120 lm\/W and A ran at 50 lm\/W. That system bottomed out at E\u2019s 0 lm\/W. Meanwhile, Signify and the lighting industry in general continue pursuing IoT, circular economy, and circadian entrainment ambitions. Watch for more soon on these subjects from LEDs. MARK HALPER is a contributing editor for LEDs Magazine, and an energy, technology, and business journalist ([email protected]).

Table 2 The global Moran\u2019s I values of variables from 2003 to 2017. Full size table Table 2 reveals that from 2003 to 2017, the Moran\u2019s I values for EEE, GTI, SubGI, and SymGI were all significantly positive, indicating spatial clustering and substantial positive spatial correlation among provinces. Additionally, it was observed that, except for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005 under conditions \\({W}_{a}\\) and \\({W}_{b}\\), where Moran\u2019s I values for PTE and SE were positive but not significant, all other periods exhibited significantly positive Moran\u2019s I values, signifying a strong positive spatial correlation between PTE and SE. Finally, the Moran\u2019s I results for ER demonstrated that under condition \\({W}_{a}\\) all Moran\u2019s I values were significantly positive, suggesting a robust positive spatial correlation among ER. Under condition \\({W}_{b}\\), apart from the years 2003 to 2006 with positive but insignificant Moran\u2019s I values, all other results were significantly positive. Under condition \\({W}_{c}\\), Moran\u2019s I values for the years 2007 to 2012 were positive but insignificant, while all other results were significantly positive. In summary, the majority of Moran\u2019s I values for ER were significantly positive, indicating a pronounced spatial dependence among ER. Overall, there is substantial spatial correlation between explanatory and dependent variables, underscoring the necessity to account for spatial effects in the study, which aligns with real-world dynamics. Estimated results of the effect of GTI on EEE under the impact of ER This section employs the DSDM to estimate the impact of GTI on EEE without considering the influence of ER (model 5) and the impact of GTI on EEE under the influence of ER (model 6), as presented in Table 3. Results from Table 3 indicate that under all three spatial weight matrices, the coefficients for the variables are generally significant. Under the \\({\\mathrm{W}}_{b}\\) weight matrix, the spatial correlation coefficients and sigma coefficients are also significant, suggesting the suitability of the DSDM model for this estimation. The lagged term coefficient of EEE (\\(\\mathrm{L}.\\mathrm{lnEEE}\\)) and the spatial spillover term coefficient of EEE under weight \\({\\mathrm{W}}_{b}\\) (\\(\\mathrm{L}.\\mathrm{WlnEEE}\\)) are both significantly positive, indicating a clear pattern of continuity, accumulation, and high interdependence among EEE in various provinces of China. In addition, under all three weight matrices, the coefficient for the quadratic term of GTI is significantly positive, indicating a U-shaped relationship between GTI and EEE. One possible explanation for this pattern is that the transformation of GTI takes time and requires significant initial investments in research and improvement, leading to relatively stable energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, resulting in a decline in EEE. However, once the GTI are widely adopted, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions are substantially reduced, leading to improved EEE. Furthermore, the study finds that the direct effect coefficients of ER on EEE and the spatial spillover effect coefficients are opposite in sign. The direct interaction effect coefficients between ER and GTI, as well as the spatial interaction effect coefficients between ER and GTI, are also opposite in sign. This makes it challenging to directly assess the impact of ER on EEE and the role of ER in this impact. Therefore, the study decomposed the model results. Since short-term estimates are particularly valuable for informing national energy controls and energy policies, this study focuses on analyzing short-term effect results, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. Table 3 Results of the impact of GTI on EEE. Full size table Table 4 Results of direct, indirect, and total effects of GTI on EEE under ER in the short-term. Full size table Table 5 Results of direct, indirect, and total effects of SubGI, SymGI on EEE under ER in the short-term. Full size table Table 4 presents the results of the direct, spatial, and total effects of GTI on EEE considering the impact of ER. The coefficients of the total effect of GTI are significantly negative under the weighting matrices \\({W}_{a}\\) and \\({W}_{b}\\) 65. Furthermore, the total effect follows the same trend as the spatial effect, indicating that the inhibitory effect of GTI on neighboring regions is greater than its promoting effect on the local region66. One possible reason for this is that the promotion of GTI leads to resource competition in neighboring areas. What sets this study apart from others is the consideration of the quadratic term of GTI26,47. The study finds that the coefficient for the quadratic term of GTI is significantly positive30 and consistent with the trend of direct effects. This suggests that there is a critical point in the impact of GTI on EEE. Before reaching this critical point, the negative spatial spillover effect of GTI on EEE is greater than the positive direct effect, leading to a decrease in EEE. However, after reaching the critical point, the positive direct effect of GTI on EEE outweighs the negative spatial spillover effect, thereby improving EEE. The main reason for this is that as GTI progresses, its required conditions become more refined, and good cooperative relationships develop among neighboring regions, accelerating the development of green technology in various regions. Similarly, under matrices \\({W}_{a}\\) and \\({W}_{b}\\), the total effect coefficient of ER on EEE is significantly positive, indicating that the implementation of ER can enhance EEE19.One possible reason for this result is that this study uses the ratio of emission fees to GDP as the measurement indicator for ER. Excessive emissions by enterprises lead to higher emission costs, increased operating costs for businesses, thereby prompting companies to update production equipment35, reduce pollutant emissions, and result in a decrease in EEE. Furthermore, the coefficient for the interaction term between ER and GTI is significantly positive, but the impact of GTI on EEE follows a U-shaped curve. This suggests that before GTI reaches its critical point, the implementation of ER mitigates the negative impact of GTI on EEE. The reason for this could be that in the early stages of GTI implementation, businesses face high sunk costs, and the implementation of environmental policies encourages businesses and individuals to invest in the research and application of green technology, thereby increasing financial support for green technology development. After GTI reaches its critical point, the implementation of ER strengthens the promoting effect of GTI on EEE. The primary reason is that the conditions required for green technology innovation are already mature, and businesses have developed awareness of green technology innovation. At this point, the implementation of ER can stimulate long-term investment and collaboration by businesses, accelerating the development and application of green technology. As illustrated in Fig. 3. Figure 3 Moderating effect of ER on the relationship between GTI and EEE. Full size image While we have gained further insights into the impact of GTI on EEE and the role of ER in this effect, the specific source of GTI\u2019s influence on EEE remains unknown. This is because GTI encompasses both the development of new energy technologies and improvement of environmental protection and resource recycling technologies. To unravel this mystery, the study decomposed GTI into SubGI and SymGI and conducted a new empirical analysis, as shown in Table 5. Under the weight matrix \\({W}_{b}\\), the coefficient of SubGI is significantly negative in the total effect, consistent with the trend observed in the GTI coefficient in Table 4. However, the coefficient of SymGI is not significant. This indicates that the effect of GTI on EEE is primarily driven by SubGI31. Which means GTI affects EEE mainly through the development and expansion of new clean energy technologies11. The possible reason is that new clean energy technologies not only reduce resource wastage but also reduce dependence on traditional fossil fuels, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions66. Furthermore, the role of ER and its effect on SubGI\u2019s impact on EEE remain consistent with the results before the decomposition of GTI. Estimated results after EEE decomposition To further estimate which component of EEE is influenced by GTI, as EEE is composed of PTE and SE, this study decomposed EEE into PTE and SE and conducted new empirical analysis, as shown in Table 6. Under the three spatial weight matrices, the coefficients of the explanatory variables corresponding to SE are almost non-significant, indicating that the impact of GTI on EEE is primarily manifested in PTE. Therefore, this research takes PTE as the dependent variable and decomposes GTI into SubGI and SymGI for re-estimation, with results shown in Table 7. Table 6 Results of the impact of GTI on PTE and SE under ER. Full size table Table 7 Results of direct, indirect, and total effects of SubGI, SymGI on PTE under ER in the short-term. Full size table Under the spatial weight matrix \\({W}_{b}\\), the total effect of SubGI on PTE is significantly negative, consistent with the direction of the spatial effect, indicating that SubGI\u2019s impact on the PTE of neighboring areas is greater than on the local area. Additionally, the total effect of SymGI on PTE is not significant, suggesting that GTI\u2019s impact on PTE is also driven by SymGI47,49. The possible reason is that the development of SubGI requires a significant capital and labor input, and as neighboring areas, some of the capital and labor within the province will also be partially absorbed, leading to a decrease in PTE given the allocated resources. In contrast, under the interaction of direct and indirect effects, ER did not play a role in the impact of SymGI on PTE. The possible reason for this is that the implementation of ER increases the emission costs for local businesses, reduces the incentive for local businesses to develop GTI, and subsequently slows down the competition for capital and labor in neighboring areas, leading to a mutual offset between the two effects. The robustness test To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the methodology adopted and the conclusions obtained in this article, a robustness test was conducted by replacing the control variables and the explanatory variable with a one-period lag. Firstly, in the robustness test involving the replacement of control variables, fiscal technology expenditure (FST) was substituted for R&D investment intensity. The effects of GTI, SubGI, SymGI, ER and the interaction term of ER with GTI, SubGI and SymGI on EEE as well as PTE are re-evaluated in this study under short-term effects based on the DSDM and the geographical distance weight matrix (\\({\\mathrm{W}}_{b}\\)), respectively. The results presented in Table 8 show that all outcomes after the replacement of control variables maintain the same positive or negative signs and levels of significance as the original results. The coefficients exhibit only minor changes when comparing before and after the substitution. This suggests a high degree of robustness in the findings, thereby confirming the reliability of our estimates. Table 8 Results of robustness tests for replacement variables. Full size table Secondly, in the short-term effects, the explanatory variables\u2019 spatial Durbin lag one-period models were employed, along with the geographical distance weight matrix (\\({\\mathrm{W}}_{b}\\)), to reassess the impact of GTI, SubGI, SymGI, ER, as well as the interactions between ER and GTI, SubGI, and SymGI on EEE and PTE. Similarly, the results in Table 9 demonstrate that all outcomes using lagged one-period explanatory variables maintain the same positive or negative signs and levels of significance as the dynamic Durbin model\u2019s results. Coefficients exhibit only minor changes, reaffirming the strong robustness of the findings and the reliability of our estimates.","filter_flag":1}

You just gotta have it. But for homeowners who can afford more, or for whom little extras make a big difference, the HVAC industry offers an array of higher-end products that can improve comfort, maximize energy efficiency, increase ease of servicing and use, and maybe add designer flair to a showcase home. The ACHR NEWS recently surveyed several major manufacturers about their high-end catalogs, asking each to put forth a product or two that meets that definition. Here are the details of some of the equipment they told us about. Bosch IDS Premium Bosch\u2019s IDS Premium Connected, a heat-pump system for ducted applications, offers high efficiency, connectivity, and monitoring features that benefit both contractor and homeowner, said Shiyu Liu, senior product manager at Bosch Home Comfort. Liu said the IDS Premium Connected is a versatile system suited for home retrofits as well as new construction. \u201cIt is a particularly excellent fit for those homeowners who are aiming for maximum energy efficiency and associated rebates and tax credits for their green home upgrades,\u201d he said. The IDS (the initials stand for Inverter Ducted Split) Premium Connected boasts a SEER2 rating of up to 20, an HSPF2 of up to 9.5, and an inverter drive that adjusts compressor speed to optimize comfort, minimize noise, and use only the amount of energy needed, Liu said. The outdoor unit is connected to a BVA20 air handler with a two-stage, electronically commutated motor. The IDS Premium Connected is available in four capacities ranging from 2 tons to 5 tons. The system connects wirelessly to the Bosch EasyAir app, an interactive platform for contractors and homeowners. EasyAir simplifies installation and troubleshooting, Liu said. \u201cWith just a few swipes on their phones, contractors can easily access information about installation, warranty registration, and how to monitor the unit remotely,\u201d he said. Homeowners must authorize a contractor\u2019s remote access to the system. The connectivity allows technicians, for example, to remotely check the heat pump\u2019s operation, get notifications in case of system faults, and view fault codes. Contractors can even manage which of their technicians can monitor which homeowner units. Daikin VRV Life FLEXIBILITY: The Daikin VRV Life heat pump system adapts high-end variable refrigerant flow technology to residential use and can be paired with a gas furnace for dual-fuel heating. (Courtesy of Daikin Comfort Technologies) Daikin\u2019s VRV Life is a variable refrigerant volume heat pump system, with efficiencies of up to 18.6 SEER2 and 9 HSPF2, engineered for residential use. \u201cOne outdoor unit can connect to up to nine indoor units, and the VRV Life can be used with either ductless or ducted systems or a combination of both,\u201d said David Palazzolo, director of residential product marketing at Daikin Comfort Technologies North America, Inc. \u201cVRV Life provides flexibility for all applications, from simplistic to the most complex, from large to small homes or apartments, from new to older construction. The more complex the application, the more VRV Life, as a single system, will provide the contractor and end user with a high-end system,\u201d Palazzolo said. The unit has an inverter compressor and a variable-speed fan, enabling it to \u201cramp up and down and provide only the necessary refrigerant to cool or heat to meet the demand, and therefore expend only the energy necessary,\u201d Palazzolo said. \u201cThe system can operate in outdoor temperatures as low as -4\u00b0F and as high as 122\u00b0F,\u201d he said. \u201cContractors as well as homeowners will appreciate the VRV Life\u2019s flexibility,\u201d Palazzolo said. \u201cVRV Life offers gas furnace, heat pump, or a combination of dual-fuel heating capability by using a traditional residential ducted gas furnace and evaporator coil that can operate using either gas heating or heat pump heating,\u201d he said. \u201cThat versatility helps contractors overcome a variety of heating and cooling challenges and meet homeowners\u2019 needs,\u201d he said. Remote monitoring of the VRV Life, by both homeowners and contractors, is available with the use of either the Daikin One+ or the Daikin One touch smart thermostats. The VRV Life is available in capacities of 2, 3, 4, and 5 tons. YORK TM9V EFFICIENCY STANDOUT: The York TM9V furnace has a two-stage burner, an electronically commutated fan motor, and annual fuel utilization efficiency rated at 96%. (Courtesy of Johnson Controls) The York TM9V two-stage variable-speed furnace, from Johnson Controls, offers an annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) of up to 96% and can be fine-tuned to specific heating needs. \u201cThis is an ideal gas furnace for homes, with hassle-free installation in tight spaces,\u201d said Tom Tasker, senior product manager for ducted system at Johnson Controls. The TM9V has a two-stage burner and an electronically commutated fan motor, and its compact size (33 inches high) and features like reinforced doors, quarter-turn knobs and positioning flexibility make installations and servicing hassle-free, Tasker said. A self-monitoring system allows for quick diagnostics, he said, and technicians can access the units remotely, with permissions, to evaluate system operation. The unit\u2019s high efficiency and ease of operation, plus the indoor comfort it provides, are some of the features that make it high end, Tasker said. \u201cHigh-end heating solutions are first and foremost about homeowner comfort. They provide premium control over the temperature and humidity of the conditioned space,\u201d Tasker said. \u201cHomeowners should expect their system to stay close to setpoint without wide temperature swings.\u201d The TM9V\u2019s ClimaTrak feature allows for fine-tuning of the blower for specific functions, such as operation in arid climates or to maximize the use of IAQ accessories like UV-C lights and MERV 16 filters, Tasker said. Tasker said the TM9V is an ideal partner for the York YZT two-stage heat pump for those homeowners in cold climates who are looking for a hybrid system to cut utility bills and their carbon footprint. Hybrid systems can reduce energy use by as much as two-thirds when the heat pump is operating, Tasker said, and eliminate the need for electric resistance backup heating. The TM9V is available in capacities ranging from 2 tons to 5 tons and can be engineered to burn either natural gas or propane. LG Hydro Kit WASTE NOT: The LG High Temperature Hydro Kit is captures heat rejected during the air-conditioning process and heats water with it for other uses, such as domestic hot water. (Courtesy of LG Air Conditioning Technologies) LG\u2019s new High Temperature Hydro Kit is a heat exchanger that captures heat rejected during the air-conditioning process and uses it to heat water for other applications, such as domestic hot water or radiant floor heating. The Hydro Kit can provide water with a leaving temperature of between 86\u00b0F and 176\u00b0F and is compatible with LG\u2019s Multi V outdoor units, variable-refrigerant flow (VRF) equipment that can provide heating and cooling to different spaces simultaneously. High efficiency, flexibility, and performance are the Hydro Kit\u2019s hallmarks, said Parth Patel, a senior product support engineer at LG Air Conditioning Technologies. The Hyrdo Kit meets the current market trends toward sustainability and decarbonization, Patel said. \u201cThe Hydro Kit utilizes waste energy generated during the conditioning process and enhances the energy efficiency of LG VRF systems,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThis allows the hot water generated to be distributed out to several different applications with integrated controls that set the temperature of the leaving water, hot water tank temperature, or the temperature of the conditioned space.\u201d The system can also be integrated with various thermostats and sensors, he said. \u201cIn situations where robust heat recovery may not be necessary, users can still benefit from repurposing the heat, using the LG Hydro Kit, and maximizing the value of the system,\u201d Patel added. The Hydro Kit can provide domestic hot water without the need for a separate water heater, for example. Features that appeal to contractors and technicians, Patel said, include a compact footprint, accessible piping connections, easy integration into a system control network, and the minimal space required for the exhaust system. METUS EZ Fit SLEEK DESIGN: The METUS EZ Fit is a ceiling-mounted indoor unit, serviceable from below without the need for above-ceiling access, that offers a SEER2 of up to 22.9. (Courtesy of Mitsubishi Electric Trane HVAC US) The EZ Fit from Mitsubishi Electric Trane HVAC US, or METUS, is a ceiling-mounted indoor unit for a ductless heat-pump system that offers a SEER2 rating of up to 22.9. The EZ Fit, for use with either a single- or multizone configuration, comes in four capacities, ranging from a half-ton (for multi-zone use only) to 1.5 tons. Ken Johnson, senior manager of performance construction at METUS, said architects, builders and homeowners in the U.S. like ceiling-mounted indoor units for their aesthetics. \u201cEZ Fit has a clean, flush-mount appearance and a single outlet vane resembling a linear diffuser found in high-end homes,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe unit recesses between ceiling joists and requires no access panel.\u201d EZ Fit offers stable room temperatures and quiet operation of both the indoor and outdoor units, Johnson said. Ductless systems, he pointed out, don\u2019t introduce dust into the conditioned space, don\u2019t require duct cleaning, and don\u2019t suffer from the energy loss that comes with duct leakage. Technicians, Johnson said, can service the unit from below and don\u2019t need ceiling access. \u201cThe filter, accessed through the grille, can be rinsed, cleaned, dried, and put back into the system, and the filter will last many years, providing the homeowner with significant savings,\u201d he said. The units fit between ceiling joists, Johnson said, and need only 8 inches of clearance. Each unit comes with a condensate lift, eliminating the need for a condensate pump, he said. \u201cThere are many applications for EZ Fit, including custom homes, townhomes, condos, single-family detached, higher-end apartments, and accessory dwelling units,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey are also ideal for retrofits and additions where it doesn\u2019t make sense to extend the ductwork for an existing forced-air system.\u201d Midea Advantage HIGH PERFORMANCE: The Midea Advantage High Wall is an indoor unit compatible with Midea Advantage heat-pump systems, which can operate continuously at outdoor temperatures of between 5\u00b0F and 122\u00b0F. (Courtesy of Midea) Midea\u2019s Advantage High Wall is an indoor unit that\u2019s compatible with Midea\u2019s Advantage single- and multizone systems. The unit, which has four fully modulating fan speeds, can achieve up to 28.1 SEER2 and up to 13 HSPF2, said David Rames, senior product manager at Midea. \u201cThe Advantage High Wall indoor unit is an efficient, variable-speed heat-pump solution with individual control, making it a perfect supplement of heating and cooling to save more energy bills while enhancing the comfort level of a specific space,\u201d Rames said. Rames said the Advantage High Wall system can achieve an energy savings of up to 30% compared to a 14.2 SEER2 system, and that using Midea\u2019s Eco mode can cut energy costs by up to 60%. Midea Advantage systems can operate continuously at outdoor temperatures of between 5\u00b0F and 122\u00b0F, Rames said. Features include a relative humidity sensor that allows users to adjust humidity in 5% increments, an anti-corrosion fin coating, and humidity removal, with the largest model, of up to 12.1 pints per hour. The units come in several capacities, ranging from three-quarters of a ton to 3 tons. Technicians, Rames said, will appreciate the installation flexibility the Advantage High Wall provides; the maximum refrigerant pipe length is 213 and the maximum height differential is 98 feet. An exterior wall hole of just three inches in diameter is required for the refrigerant piping and electrical cable. \u201cYou can flexibly install the unit in any needed area,\u201d Rames said. The unit disassembles quickly and has a removable filter on top, making for simplified maintenance, Rames said. The motor and blower can be serviced without removing the cabinet, he said. Trane XV20i SMART SYSTEM: Trane\u2019s XV20i heat pump comes equipped with advance communications technology and a variable-speed fan that helps it adapt in real time to the needs of the conditioned space. (Courtesy of Trane Residential) The Trane XV20i heat pump, with a SEER2 of up to 20.5 and an HSPF2 of up to 8.7, is one of the most efficient heat pumps on the market, according to Katie Davis, vice president of engineering and technology at Trane Residential. The unit has a variable-speed fan that adapts to the needs of the conditioned space in real time and is equipped with communications technologies that simplify installation and servicing and, in zoned applications, optimize comfort and efficiency, Davis said. \u201cTrane\u2019s XV20i variable-speed heat pump with Link is perfect for the homeowner looking to maximize energy efficiency \u2026 whether this is a luxury apartment, a remodeled home, or new construction,\u201d Davis said. Link technology, Davis said, assists with the installation of the XV20i by automating configuration, charging, and system testing. With homeowner opt-in, Link lets technicians remotely monitor the system, get fault alerts, adjust thermostat settings if needed, and receive descriptions of potential issues and their causes should a fault be identified, she said. \u201cIf a home visit is necessary, the technician can arrive onsite with the parts needed to repair the system,\u201d Davis said. New to Link technology, as of October, is Link Zoning, the brains of an advanced, quiet, and intelligent duct system that learns where airflow is needed most, Davis said. \u201cThe new Link Zoning system uses a network of controls, sensors, and motorized dampers for up to six zones to optimize temperature and humidity throughout a home, delivering warm or cool air to only the rooms and zones that need it,\u201d she said. The XV20i comes in four capacities: 2, 3, 4, and 5 tons.","filter_flag":1}

To hear more about the product launch and Naviens plans for the HVAC market, Supply House Times chatted with Product Management Director David Hoskyn after the event. Available in Upflow and Horizontal configurations, the NPF comes in two sizes of 60,000 BTU\/h and 100,000 BTU\/h that both boast 97.0% AFUE and meet the stringent requirements of SCAQMD rule 1111 for Ultra-Low NOx performance. SHT: Tell us about the decision to branch into the HVAC market. Why is now the right time? DH: We have heard that question many times during the development and launch of the Hydro-furnace, but I want to point out that indirectly we have been in HVAC for a while. We have seen our boilers or water heaters feeding air handling units with hydronics coils for many years. The NPF now combines those to give us a true HVAC product in the market. We also understand that the entire industry is evolving and changing, but we feel there is still a place for this product. SHT: What is the Hydro-Furnace, and how does it work exactly? DH: The Hydro-furnace combines the proven technology of our stainless-steel condensing heat exchanger with a hydronic heat exchanger coil that is placed in the conditioned air stream. In heating mode, water is heated in the combustion heat exchanger and pumped up through the hydronic coil. The hot water flowing through the coil then heats the air stream. One major advantage of this process is our ability to vary the combustion capacity of the unit from 15-100%, which combined with the ECM variable speed blower provides a very consistent room temperature throughout the varying demands of the heating season. This design also allows us to operate the unit at a much lower plenum temperature, and control the unit based on either the supply air temperature or return air temperature. Available in Upflow and Horizontal configurations, the NPF comes in two sizes of 60,000 BTU\/h and 100,000 BTU\/h that both boast 97.0% AFUE and meet the stringent requirements of SCAQMD rule 1111 for Ultra-Low NOx performance. SHT: How much research and development went into this product? Have you considered the specific needs and preferences of HVAC contractors in your product design? DH: As with all our products, there was extensive R&D done on the Hydro-furnace, along with field trials in existing home applications. The benefit of this product is that it adapts much of the technology from our other boilers, combining many proven off the shelf components. In terms of the needs and preferences of the HVAC contractors, we tried to address those through industry standard cabinet widths to adapt to coils, common furnace heights to help with replacement work, and fully capable airflows up to 1.0\u201d static. In addition, the control panel on the NPF provides a clear setup wizard to assist with set up, along with full menu functionality to adjust heating, cooling, and airflow. The NPF also includes the option for either variable air control, or constant air volume. All of this is done using any single stage or two stage thermostat and does not require the addition of a special wall control. And to help support the contractor, the NPF will carry a strong warranty which will include 1 year labor coverage for all products. SHT: How will Navien address environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements in its HVAC products? DH: The name Navien is made up from the words \u201cNavigating Energy and Environment\u201d and comes from our desire to make products that are environmentally responsible and lower energy usage. From our launch of the first condensing tankless water heater in North America back in 2008, to our condensing combi and boiler products, our focus is on high efficiency products to lower energy use and emissions. The NPF continues that with a 97.0% AFUE rating, and controls that operate the unit only at the capacity required to satisfy the load. Combined with Ultra-Low NOx on all the units, not just market specific ones, we help lower the GHG emissions throughout the US and Canada. SHT: What are the future plans for Navien and the HVAC market? Are there more new products on the pipeline? DH: We are always looking at products that we can add to our lineup, but only if it adds value to the market. If we can introduce a product that does not currently exist, or improve on one that already does, then we certainly will consider it. Since Navien is part of a global company, we are also looking at other markets such as Europe and Asia to follow developments there. I am confident that the NPF will not be the last new product that we introduce for North America. SHT: What are the top customer \u2014 contractor and end user \u2014 needs in the tankless market in 2023? DH: As we know the tankless industry is going through some changes right now. Issues such as efficiency regulations, electrification, and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions all have been in the news lately. The trades are also still trying to bring more people to the workforce to help install and service whatever products are out there. Finally the end users are still not sure what many of these changes mean for them in terms of all gas appliances, not just water heaters. But for tankless in general I don\u2019t think the needs have changed that much \u2013 the contractor wants you to have a good product that is easy to install and service, and provide training and technical support to help them be efficient at their job. They also want to know that you are a reliable source for information about what is going on in the industry, since most are too busy to keep up with the changes. As for the end user \u2013 they want hot water without having to worry about it. SHT: How has the global push for decarbonization affected Navien\u2019s product development and go-to-market strategy? DH: As I mentioned before, we are looking at the changes that are happening not just in the US and Canada, but also in Europe, Asia, and other countries. We are exploring products in the electric segment for North America, both resistance and heat pump technology. Adding one or both of those to our lineup will happen once we have the right products for our market. In addition we are testing with Hydrogen as a fuel source, both as a blend and pure hydrogen. That work is being done while still improving and developing our gas fired products, including additional residential commercial boilers and commercial water heaters. SHT: What new technologies and product features are on the rise in the water heating market? DH: Navien believes there is a place in the market for both electric and gas fired water heaters. We continue to look at options for electric source water heaters, but also exploring ways to improve gas efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Moving forward solutions such as dual fuel source products can help address applications that utilize the best of both technologies. An evolving area of products is the user interface, or the control panel that is now showing up on products. The launch of the Navien NPE-A2\/S2 included the EZ-Nav panel, which is a multi-line backlit display. This control makes the set up and operation of the product simpler and faster for the installer and helps a service contractor with maintenance or issues in the field. Wireless connectivity to the product for the end user also continues to grow, as IOT products become the norm in homes nowadays. Finally, as the workforce needs to be educated on the evolving technologies, we are looking at ways to help shorten the learning curve on both installation and service of the products. You will see more service tools that interface through a phone or tablet with the products in the future, reducing diagnostic time in the field.","filter_flag":1}

Yet the gap between the leaders and the laggards is growing: The evidence shows that huge differences remain in both the speed and the cost of decarbonization between companies and even among similar assets at the same company. Closing this gap will be critical: to reach net zero by 2050, the average energy intensity of the global supply of oil and gas in 2030 will need to be more than 50% lower than it was in 2022. Companies that lead on decarbonization have proven that they can gain not just a smaller carbon footprint but also a material bottom-line impact, potentially higher revenues, and real competitive advantage. They do so by pulling every abatement lever applicable to their portfolio\u2014including greater energy efficiency, reductions in escaping gases, and switching to low-carbon sources of power and heat\u2014in the most effective way possible. Companies that lead on decarbonization have proven that they can gain material bottom-line impact and real competitive advantage. We analyze how these leaders have gotten past the decarbonization commitment stage and are now reaping the benefits of developing superior decarbonization capabilities. Finally, we lay out how other companies can follow in their lower-carbon footprints. Good News and Bad News We looked at 40 O&G companies, which together contribute more than 25% of the sector\u2019s GHG emissions. The good news is that our analysis shows that 20% of them reduced either their emissions or their emissions intensity by more than 20% between 2017 and 2022. To get there, these companies have pulled on one or more decarbonization levers, including: A shift to lower-emitting products (from oil to gas, for example) Operational and energy efficiencies Flaring reductions Methane emissions reductions Renewable energy Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) Switching to bio-based fuels for power and heat generation Many of the companies that are making progress on decarbonization are actively using revenue opportunities to help fund their further decarbonization efforts. Some are installing solar panels to replace the electricity generated by their gas power plants, for example, and at least one plans to sell the surplus energy to generate cash. And one petrochemicals company was able to capture enough CO 2 through CCUS technology to use it to increase its methanol production. The bad news, however, is that the gap between what the industry has accomplished so far and what needs to be done is still huge. Producers of around 40% of global oil and gas production have not yet announced any commitment to a net zero target, and at least half of that is concentrated at the top ten companies. In fact, at least 40% of companies in our analysis actually increased their emissions or emissions intensity between 2017 and 2022. Moreover, there is frequently a large variance in emissions intensity among a company\u2019s assets in the same asset class. Despite similar levels of complexity and maturity, and even when they are within the same jurisdiction and under the same operator, some assets are as much as seven times more emissions intensive than others. The Promise Yet those O&G companies that are developing superior decarbonization capabilities have already begun to capture competitive advantage through both bottom-line improvement and strategic gains. Consider, for example, an offshore O&G platform in a mature basin. Many of the multiple gas turbines, compressors, pumps, and boilers it runs are redundant, serving primarily as back-up, and are operating with less-than-optimal energy efficiency. Leading companies are removing such unnecessary equipment and run the rest as efficiently as possible. Less equipment directly cuts operations and maintenance activities, and thus costs. By reducing its equipment needs, one North Sea platform operator lowered emissions by 30% and operating costs by 20%. In addition, according to reports, 23% of global GHG emissions across industries are subject to an emissions trading system or carbon tax of some kind, and another 13% to various carbon reduction incentives such as carbon credits. In these jurisdictions, less emissions directly results in either savings or new sources of income. In the UK, for example, where carbon prices on the Emissions Trading System hit close to \u00a3100 per ton of CO 2 e in 2022, removing a single gas turbine could reduce emissions permanently by 20 kilotons of CO 2 e and could lead to up to \u00a32 million in savings per year. According to our analysis, a carbon price of $100 per ton would add between $2 and $4 per barrel to oil refineries\u2019 operating costs. That\u2019s a lot, given that refineries operate at low margins, so the additional cost could risk the refinery\u2019s competitive advantage. A further risk is that a company\u2019s performance on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, including its emissions performance, is beginning to influence its borrowing costs, with sustainability leaders securing a significantly lower cost of capital\u2014an average of around 266 basis points less than O&G sector laggards, according to our analysis. O&G companies that can decarbonize quickly will also gain a real strategic advantage. In jurisdictions with decarbonization targets, for example, the advantage will go to producers of oil and gas with the lowest carbon footprint. The result: a greater likelihood that they will retain their regulatory and social licenses to operate and earn the right to redevelop their current assets and to gain access to new acreage. And they can use their advantage as leverage to pursue M&A deals in these jurisdictions. Moreover, the technologies required to decarbonize current assets can also give companies a head start in entering and scaling up new, higher-value energy and low-carbon businesses. For example, building an electrolyzer to decarbonize the supply of refinery hydrogen could open up future opportunities in the nascent low-carbon hydrogen market. Four Imperatives for the New Paradigm In our experience, taking the right approach to decarbonization can cut the typical O&G company\u2019s abatement costs by up to 20% and increase revenues, boosting the return on their investment in some decarbonization projects by as much as 25%. To achieve these gains, companies must put into practice four key imperatives. (See Exhibit 1.)","filter_flag":1}

BEST PROJECT Submitted by: Stellar Owner: Swift Prepared Foods Lead Design Firm: Tanya Tillett General Contractor\/Structural Engineer\/Civil Engineer\/MEP Engineer: Stellar Subcontractor: CNC Foundations Built on a greenfield site in Columbia, Mo., the 315,000-sq-ft Swift Prepared Foods facility produces a variety of dried meats, including salami, pepperoni, prosciutto, pancetta and coppa. Initial processing of raw product occurs in Unit 1. Product is then moved via robotic automated guided vehicles into Unit 2, which is the drying and salting area. Once drying or fermenting processes are complete, the product is moved into Units 3, 4, and 5, which are the ready-to-eat areas. From there, the product is sliced, packaged and shipped. Other areas of the facility feature a research and development plant and a show kitchen. In addition, Stellar designed and constructed two employee welfare areas on either side of the facility to separate the \u201craw\u201d side personnel from \u201cready-to-eat\u201d side personnel. At the main office, there\u2019s a small pilot testing plant for new products and an Italian caf\u00e9-inspired show kitchen for customers. Photo courtesy of Notley Hawkins The $149-million two-year project broke ground in April 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the project, the team saw a shortage of roofing materials, which created challenges with interior construction. Process equipment purchased by the owner was being delivered from overseas, and unpredictable delivery dates caused some delays. Frequent coordination meetings were critical for timely completion of scopes of work. In the end, the team was able to deliver the facility on time in May 2023. The team took a three-phase approach, which included a BIM coordinator, a quality manager and a commissioning representative. Using BIM helped facilitate subcontractor meetings and real-time progress tracking, minimizing delays and incomplete installations. The integration of pre-functional checklists and site visits enabled timely completion and reduced the number of punch-list items. Additionally, the commissioning representative developed a hybrid quality plan, optimizing construction document reviews and resolving conflicts efficiently. Photo courtesy of Notley Hawkins Stellar\u2019s quality control responsibilities spanned from the design phase to project completion and warranty period. For the Swift project, an internal quality representative was assigned early on to establish and manage a hybrid commissioning\/quality plan. This plan encompassed the installation of HVAC, utilities and electrical systems from design development to project close-out. The utilization of Procore software facilitated document storage and management throughout each phase. A notable feature of the project was the incorporation of advanced automation technology into the Italian meats and charcuterie production facility. Collaborative meetings between Stellar and Swift resulted in an energy efficient layout and advanced process equipment design. Automated guided vehicles, gantry robots and conveyor belts were employed to ensure seamless flow and maximize productivity. The increased production capacity and improved operational efficiency will enhance the client\u2019s profitability and competitiveness. Moreover, the integration of advanced materials, such as those used in the facility\u2019s design, sets new industry benchmarks for energy efficiency and sustainability.","filter_flag":1}

JH: We've been talking about electronic control systems taking the place of mechanical controls for years now. I can remember when electronically actuated hydraulics made up 5 or 7% of the market. Now we\u2019re well above 50% \u2013 it\u2019s been a 15-year journey to get there. The use of electronic controls is a long-term trend that will continue. A key reason is that OEMs want to differentiate and customize their solutions, and that is almost always done with software today. Hydraulic components have to be electronically actuated to work with these custom solutions. P&M: What are some of the key features or performance attributes your company is working to include with its hydraulic components and systems, or for which customers are asking? JH: Efficiency is, by far, the most common request we get from customers. They need more efficient hydraulic products and solutions, which is a big reason we continue to optimize components and develop new products that reduce power losses. A number of factors are driving this demand, including our customers\u2019 sustainability agendas. Many of those agendas include product circularity, which is another area we\u2019re focused on at Danfoss. We look at the complete lifecycle of the product, beginning with the design through to whether it can be remanufactured or recycled \u2013 and if not, how it can be disposed of in the most environmentally responsible manner. To attain true circularity and meet our targets as well as our customers\u2019 targets, we are partnering with customers on the development of new products and solutions, transportation options, and lifecycle optimization. Power density remains a key attribute of hydraulics. With the rise of electric solutions, we\u2019re continuing to improve our components, aiming for even smaller package sizes and higher pressures. READ MORE: Digital Hydraulics Improve Excavator Efficiency P&M: How much, if at all, are you seeing electronic alternatives taking the place of hydraulic components or systems? Can you offer some examples, and how you possibly see this trend progressing? JH: The electrification transformation of mobile machines is coming. It\u2019s already here, to some degree. Electrics have long been important in material handling machines like forklifts. But now, almost every construction OEM has a lineup of battery-powered equipment. From excavators to wheel loaders, we see a number of machines with battery-powered electric architectures. In the past, we might have classified these machines as proofs of concept or reputation machines, where OEMs vied to be the first to introduce electric alternatives to conventional diesel engines. We\u2019re moving beyond that now and starting to see production in significant volumes. Legislation plays a role in this. Some cities in Europe and Japan, for example, are mandating low- or zero-emission vehicles within city limits. Noise pollution is also an increasing target of legislation. In these cases, electrically powered machinery may be the only viable solution. We're still in the early stages of the transformation, but as buyers become more sensitive to emissions and the precision of controllability, electrification will accelerate. Today, many electric machines still have hydraulic systems because fluid power dominates in terms of linear actuation. The long-term trend, though, is that electrics will take more share from hydraulics.","filter_flag":1}

Here's how solid-state electricity could impact your home. While some products, like cell phones and e-bikes, have skyrocketed with technological innovations over the last couple of decades, the electrical grid in our homes and other buildings has remained pretty much static. But that might be about to change. Starting in late 2024, silicon chips with solid-state technology will begin to be incorporated into some home electrical components, such as LED lighting, circuit breakers and outlet receptacles. For a non-techie, that might sound insignificant, complicated and\/or boring, but it\u2019s something that could notably affect your life. Behind the scenes, these products are designed to keep you safer and make your home more energy efficient. \u201cThe fact that today\u2019s modern world is still being powered by the same dangerous infrastructure from back in Thomas Edison\u2019s day shows how ready society is for a change,\u201d says Thar Casey, founder and CEO of AmberSemi. \u201cOnce this upgrade has occurred, solid-state will be the norm for every outlet, smart home ecosystem and LED dimmer switch in your home. A true second electrical revolution of the power grid will be complete.\u201d Casey is understandably enthusiastic about solid-state chips. His company is leading the charge, partnering with components manufacturers to roll out the new technology. Gradually, consumers will start seeing packaging with the phrase \u201cPowered by AmberSemi solid-state power technologies.\u201d Here\u2019s what to know about solid-state home electrical components, and when you can expect to see them in your home. What Does Solid-State Mean? Solid-state refers to electrical components, devices and systems based on semiconductor technology. These components are digital, so they operate without the need for moving or analog parts. Solid-state technology as a whole is not new, but it has been rapidly expanding to new products, from cellphones to rechargeable batteries. \u201cThe best way to illustrate the impact of solid-state tech is with televisions,\u201d says Casey. \u201cLook at the intelligence and expanded features possible in solid-state-based smart TVs, and how they are worlds more advanced than the old-school, bulky tube TVs that were the norm all the way up until the early 2000s.\u201d What Are Solid-State Home Electric Components? Solid-state home electrical components are endpoints, such as dimmers, circuit breakers and smart-home systems that incorporate silicon chips. This makes them safer, because they cannot arc (create a prolonged electrical discharge). It also means they can be controlled digitally. Currently, AmberSemi holds a series of patents on the technology, and is working with global electrical products and semiconductor companies to integrate their chips into those products. Advantages of Home Electric Solid-State Components Solid-state components can control electricity digitally, and what that means for your home is that they are: Safer, because they are arc-free, so they don\u2019t have the potential to create house fires. Surge proof. Programmable, so they can interface with AI and other smart-home tech to increase energy efficiency. Smaller in size, so they take up less infrastructure space. \u201cSimply put, solid-state is the future of home electricity because it will make buildings profoundly safer, healthier, smarter and more energy-efficient,\u201d says Casey. Solid-state electrical components may also have a profound effect on the industrial and regulatory sides of the industry. Being programmable means manufacturers don\u2019t have to design as many components specific to product types and regions. Increased safety and efficiency also means new electrical codes could be more simple. Will Solid-State Products Cost More? In theory, no, says Casey. Once the technology reaches mass-market manufacturing scale, solid-state components should generally cost less per unit to manufacture than traditional components, while also providing energy savings in homes. \u201cThe big unknown will be if manufacturers increase the price of their technologies once solid-state is adopted, because of the direct increase in the value of their products based on added features,\u201d says Casey. He uses an innovative Nest thermostat as an example. It initially launched at a high price point, sold well because of the technology, but is now available at a more reasonable price. When Will Solid-State Home Electrical Components Be Available? Some consumer products with solid-state tech will begin to hit the market in late 2024. But, it may take a while for it to become the norm. Casey attributes that in part to an \u201cIt ain\u2019t broke, so why fix it\u201d mentality within the industry. \u201cThe \u2018old tech\u2019 still works, the factories\u2019 tooling is in place and optimized and they\u2019re regularly pumping out millions of units efficiently around the world,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, consumers are familiar with and accept the products and functionality as-is, and the companies make a lot of money today with the current arrangement, which creates hesitation to change.\u201d Yet, solid-state technology has become the norm with many other products, so it\u2019s likely home electric will be no exception. \u201cThere\u2019s more motivation than ever to make the transformation,\u201d says Casey. \u201cThe process is currently in motion.

The paddle-type device is used chute-side as calves are processed. When held against a calf\u2019s chest (right side of chest, behind the elbow), it detects and measures heart and lung functions, and sends the data wirelessly to an app on your computer tablet. That information, plus a rectal temperature and weight, predicts the calf\u2019s risk of developing bovine respiratory disease (BRD). You get a simple \u201ctreat\u201d or \u201cno-treat\u201d message on the tablet. The goal of Whisper On Arrival is to eliminate guesswork and routine antimicrobial treatment of every animal, according to Merck veterinary experts. In tests, the technology has been shown to reduce antibiotic use by 10% to 43% in at-risk calves. Missouri cattle backgrounder Aaron Miller, an early user of the technology, says, \u201cWe now treat only the calves indicated by the system. Our overall cattle health is better, and we see fewer cases of pneumonia.\u201d The Whisper paddle is user-friendly, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning where to hold it to get a good reading. We take the reading, do other processing, and then see the results. It takes about 15 seconds.\u201d The Whisper On Arrival system costs about $1,300, and you pay $2.20 per animal scanned. A 60-day trial period lets you scan for free to make sure you are comfortable with the technology.

Argonne\u2019s Polaris supercomputer brings advanced capabilities for research involving simulation, AI and data analysis workloads. Image Credit: Argonne National Laboratory. It can be challenging for established companies to strike a balance between profit margins and R&D costs. Modern product development requires sophisticated computer modeling, which saves companies millions of dollars by eliminating the need for costly prototypes and testing. Such modeling, whether for the search for new chemicals or materials or for simulating mechanical engineering issues, is time-intensive and costly, and new products take years to develop from concept to production. While many of the world\u2019s fastest computers are privately held, constructing such a computing infrastructure is both dangerous and expensive. This is why government support for supercomputing is crucial to the advancement of American commerce. The High Performance Computing for Energy Innovation (HPC4EI) program of the US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced financing for a new round of business partnerships. Through these initiatives, the private sector will be able to better utilize DOE\u2019s high-performance computing (HPC) facilities to increase industrial efficiency and investigate novel materials for use in clean energy applications. Four of the projects are receiving assistance from DOE\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, which also provides access to its supercomputing capabilities and expertise. This includes Argonne\u2019s Laboratory Computing Resource Center and the potent systems at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science user facility. Employing cutting-edge computing resources is one advantage, but companies will also gain from collaborating with some of the top HPC specialists globally. Scientists at Argonne are skilled in leveraging supercomputers and collaborating with partners to optimize workloads related to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing for the systems. This year, Ford Motor Company, Capstone Green Energy, Lakril Technologies Corporation, and Power Systems Manufacturing are partners in Argonne\u2019s HPC4EI initiatives. The breadth of these awards shows how DOE\u2019s investment in Argonne\u2019s massive HPC resources and deep expertise can help companies large and small improve their products while reducing carbon emissions. David Martin, Manager, Industry Partnerships and Outreach, Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, US Department of Energy Helping Ford with Battery Technology Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials, a DOE Office of Science user facility, is led by group leader Subramanian Sankaranarayanan, who oversees the lab\u2019s collaboration with Ford Motor Company\u2019s research to enhance battery manufacturing efficiency. To build robust long-cycling lithium batteries for electric vehicles, solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) production is a crucial process that Sankaranarayanan and Ford researchers will model and enhance using high-performance computing (HPC). Currently, one of the longest processes in the battery production process is the development of the SEI, which can take a week or longer. Researchers can assist battery facilities in drastically lowering energy usage and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by hastening the production of SEI. Power and Heat Generation with Microturbines Though the C200 microturbine system for power and heat generation from Capstone Green Energy is already environmentally friendly, the company intends to redesign, optimize, and refit the system so that it runs exclusively on hydrogen fuel in collaboration with Argonne research scientist Debolina Dasgupta. The computational fluid dynamics simulations needed to evaluate and contrast designs in order to generate a configuration that can guarantee the optimum of the engine\u2019s design for combustion and fuel injection systems are one reason why Capstone needs supercomputers. Capstone\u2019s transition to hydrogen fuel will be aided by this new modeling effort, which will lower nitrogen oxide emissions. Argonne Sketching Out a \u201cGreen\u201d Paint John Low, an Argonne computational scientist, is working with Lakril Technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of the $10 billion paint, coatings, adhesive, and super absorbent polymer (diapers) markets. They hope to lessen the 16 million kg of CO 2 produced yearly to produce the acrylic acid that is normally used to make these products by turning corn and other bio-derived sugar sources into paints and coatings. The team wants to boost a new catalyst\u2019s performance so that it can facilitate the switch to sustainable biomass feedstocks by utilizing Argonne\u2019s HPC facilities. Reducing Hydrogen Flashback With the help of cutting-edge technology from Power Systems Manufacturing (PSM), gas turbines could co-fire with renewable gases like hydrogen, reducing the amount of carbon in the power system overall. In hydrogen-fueled combustion systems, a typical issue known as \u201cflashback\u201d occurs when the combustion chamber flame leaks into the nozzle, damaging the apparatus. PSM will simulate engine redesigns and optimizations using artificial intelligence and the lab\u2019s high-performance computing (HPC) tools in collaboration with Argonne computational scientist Shashi Aithal to comprehend and lower the risk of flashbacks. These developments will help PSM reduce emissions, shorten production times, and save costs by enabling it to convert carbon-emitting power generation equipment into greener, hydrogen-burning products. The DOE\u2019s offices of Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization, Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies, and Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, all within the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office, are the sponsors of the HPC4EI program.","filter_flag":1}

The global manufacturer held its 2023 Daikin Group Sales Meeting (DGSM), Sept. 29-30 in San Antonio, leveraging the event as a stage to showcase emerging innovations across numerous industry sectors. \u201cInnovation isn't static, and neither is Daikin,\u201d said Yu Nishiwaki, COO, Daikin Applied Americas. \u201cWe continue to bring innovations forward and remain process-oriented. Our goal is to keep Daikin at the forefront as the industry continues to transform.\u201d TUNED IN: A few 2023 Daikin Group Sales Meeting attendees enjoy a preview of the company\u2019s latest innovations. 2 equivalent impact of HFCs could be reduced by up to approximately 800 million tons of CO 2 . This is the equivalent of 50% of the annual carbon absorption provided by the Amazon rain forest.\u201d - Philip Johnston general manager, environmental business development center Daikin Applied Americas \u201cIf all equipment presently using R-410A was replaced by R-32, the total COequivalent impact of HFCs could be reduced by up to approximately 800 million tons of CO. This is the equivalent of 50% of the annual carbon absorption provided by the Amazon rain forest.\u201d R-32: \u2018Proven, Easy, Efficient, and Available\u2019 At the event, Daikin touted its use of low-GWP refrigerants throughout its portfolio. One refrigerant in particular, R-32, drew wide acclaim from company representatives. R-32 is an organic, colorless, odorless, mildly flammable hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) compound with the formula CH\u2082F\u2082. The refrigerant, which has a GWP of 675, is being specified by Daikin, and other HVAC manufacturers, as a next-generation equipment replacement for R-410A, an HFC that is currently being phased out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to its high GWP value. \u201cR-32 is the most balanced refrigerant in terms of environmental impact, energy efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness,\u201d said Philip Johnston, general manager, environmental business development center, Daikin Applied Americas. \u201cWe chose R-32 because it's proven, easy, efficient, and available. \u201cIf all equipment currently using R-410A was replaced by R-32, the total CO 2 equivalent impact could be reduced by as much as 800 million tons,\u201d continued Johnston. \u201cThis is the equivalent of 50% of the annual carbon absorption provided by the Amazon rain forest.\u201d Daikin is very familiar with R-32. The manufacturer first introduced the refrigerant in its heat pumps in November 2012 in Japan. As of December 2022, the company has sold approximately 42 million R-32 units in more than 130 countries and regions. \u201cR-32 has been proven to be effective time and time again,\u201d said Kelly Hearnsberger, vice president of advanced product marketing and innovation, Daikin Comfort Technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s currently a commodity worldwide, making it easy to obtain. And as a single-component refrigerant, it will be easy to reclaim, recycle, and reuse, which will be crucial going forward.\u201d New Products Daikin announced it will be introducing 13 new products over the next 18 months, extending the manufacturer\u2019s electrification, efficiency, and performance boundaries. Highlights include new centrifugal chillers, air-source heat pumps, water-source heat pumps, and more. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about all of our new products,\u201d said Kyle Evenson, vice president and general manager, AAH operations, Daikin Applied Americas. \u201cJust in our business unit, we\u2019re spending north of $30 million on new innovations, which includes upgrading factories, adding new machinery and robotics, and more. We can\u2019t wait to get this new equipment out into the field.\u201d Chillers The Magnitude WME-D magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller features full-load efficiency as low as 0.53 kW per ton and part-load efficiency as low as 0.32 kw per ton. It is designed to use R-1234ze and R-515B and is capable of producing 125\u00b0F condenser leaving water temperature. The unit, which features a capacity of up to approximately 450 tons, is currently in production. The company expects to begin taking orders in March 2024. \u201cThe compressor in the WME-D now has two stages inside the impeller,\u201d said Jim Macosko, vice president, product and sustainability solutions, Daikin Applied. \u201cIn a centrifugal chiller, generally, the more stages, the greater the operating range. Rather than dumping that 125\u00b0 heat out at a cooling tower, we can now circulate it into the building and use it to preheat the domestic hot water system.\u201d The Magnitude WMT magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller operates with a full-load performance as low as 0.50 kW per ton and a part-load operation of 0.30 kW per ton. It is designed to utilize R-1233zd, and Daikin anticipates taking orders on the unit in November. \u201cThis chiller is designed for customers seeking a low-GWP, nonflammable refrigerant,\u201d said Arthur Rizoli, director of centrifugal products, Daikin Applied Americas. \u201cThe two-stage unit is great for retrofits, due to its size and volume.\u201d The Trailblazer AGZ-F scroll chiller is available in 30-240 tons and operates at full-load efficiencies of up to 11.2 EER and part-load IPLV up to 16.7 EER. The unit will utilize R-32. \u201cThere's been a lot of talk about aluminum microchannel coils and the challenge with corrosion, particularly in coastal environments, so we\u2019ve introduced a proprietary Daikin blue coil coating,\u201d said Macosko. \u201cThis coil comes with a 10-year warranty, granting customers assurance that their equipment is protected for years to come. \u201cThis unit also showcases the advantages of R-32, as it\u2019s smaller in size and features less aluminum and copper,\u201d continued Macosko. \u201cAll of these factors, including a more efficient charge and performance, are appreciated by customers, especially when space and optimizing operations are primary concerns.\u201d Heat Pumps The MEGA-Q heat pump is a VRV-based heat pump hot water generation system that warms water up to 194\u00b0. The inverter-driven heat pump operates using R-410A, and its split system design allows for indoor or outdoor installation. The product is expected to be available in the summer of 2024. \u201cThis is our first offering into commercial domestic hot water,\u201d said Darren Sheehan, vice president, VRV and commercial products, Daikin Comfort Technologies. \u201cThe MEGA-Q heat pump offers a solution for buildings that truly aim to be all-electric.\u201d The Rebel Applied Inverter Heat Pump packaged rooftop system, which operates with R-32, is available in 30- to 52-ton sizes. A smaller version, the Rebel Inverter Air-Source Heat Pump, is available in 3- to 31-ton sizes. Both units will be available to ship starting in the first quarter of 2024. \u201cWe've really redesigned the entire Rebel unit and optimized its size,\u201d said Macosko. \u201cThe footprint of this is about 30%-40% smaller than the prior model. To achieve that, we've moved the condenser unit onto the top of the unit, which takes up less room.\u201d The SmartSource Water-Source Heat Pump, available in vertical, horizontal, and V-stack configurations, is available in 2- to 6-ton sizes. The units are expected to be available by the end of the year. \u201cThis unit will be offered in a three-tier lineup with a good, better, best approach,\u201d said Macosko. \u201cMore and more geothermal projects are seeking higher efficiency units, so we wanted to make sure we were meeting those needs.\u201d Through all of its innovations, Daikin continues to focus on solving customers\u2019 problems, regardless of the shape, size, or application. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to solving our customers\u2019 problems,\u201d said Rob Landes, director, HVAC systems applications, Daikin Applied. \u201cWhether it\u2019s electrification, efficiency, refrigerants, etc., we\u2019re here to provide the solutions to their system challenges.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

All four products, stated the vendor, are hardware prepared for Open RAN deployments and have high- and standard-capacity variants to address varying site needs. \u201cOur new and enhanced RAN Compute portfolio was designed with Ericsson\u2019s customers and their future needs in mind. It both addresses their need to maximize spectrum utilization and facilitates their desire to future-proof their networks with support for Open RAN architectures. The focus on innovation and energy efficiency while reducing both footprint and total cost of ownership has resulted in powerful hardware and software that is both reliable and flexible,\u201d commented Michael Begley, head of RAN compute, Ericsson. The company said that the new RAN processors have four times the capacity compared to the previous generation and can support up to six 4G and 5G modes in a single unit, noting that in more advanced markets, 5G typically utilize three to four modes in basebands. \u201cThe additional modes made possible by the products announced today will allow CSPs to run more technologies simultaneously on one RAN Compute board, including 5G time division duplex (TDD) Massive MIMO, 4G and 5G frequency division duplex (FDD), and more, with modes to spare for future needs,\u201d continued Ericsson. The routers can be leveraged through the new Ericsson Transport Automation Controller, announced earlier this week and designed to pick up network degradations and capacity utilization issues, delivering insights into how to optimize overall network performance. The new products all house Ericsson-made silicon built on a modular architecture, which the vendor claimed enables a 30-60% cut in power consumption compared to industry benchmarks. For this portfolio, Ericsson is working with Intel, utilizing Intel 4 technology, as part of the pair\u2019s larger strategic collaboration around 5G SoCs.","filter_flag":1}

BIOMASS DELUSION: Stand Earth\u2019s latest report sheds unfavorable light on the fashion industry\u2019s switch to burning biomass, which is billed as a renewable energy source by many brands that are seeking alternatives to coal and fossil fuels. The advocacy group\u2019s report, titled Biomass Burning: The Fashion Industry\u2019s False Phase-Out,\u201d notes that using biomass \u2014 often wood pellets \u2014 increases deforestation and delays the switch to renewable sources such as solar and wind. Other materials burned can include what are billed as \u201cgreen alternatives,\u201d including rice husks, straw and palm shells. Biomass has been used widely across the fashion industry to knock down carbon emissions numbers, the report said. Contrary to intent, burning biomass can increase greenhouse gas and carbon emissions in a company\u2019s supply chain, according to the report. The report does a deep dive into the supply chains and manufacturing lists of Uniqlo parent company Fast Retailing, Gap, H&M, Zara parent company Inditex, Nike and Puma that are touting biomass as a low-carbon alternative in the dyeing and finishing process. In an email to Stand Earth, Fast Retailing acknowledged that they \u201crecognize the issue of biomass boilers and are currently acting across [its] supply chain to minimize their use.\u201d The company added it plans to \u201ctake immediate action with [its] production partners, including a review of the use of these boilers with serious impacts.\u201d Inditex said it sees \u201cbiomass as a transition solution as other alternatives are developed and scaled.\u201d The fashion companies are increasingly using biomass as an alternative to coal throughout Asian factories, including Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Using the example of Cambodia, Stand Earth noted that roughly one-third of the 1,200 garment factories there burn 620 tons of forest wood every day, according to a 2021 study from the University of London. \u201cThe bottom line is that there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018sustainable biomass,\u2019\u201d said Stand Earth research specialist Xixi Zhang, who headed up the report. \u201cThe increased reliance on biomass boilers poses severe threats to our climate, ecosystems and human health, all while hindering the industry\u2019s essential shift to renewable energy in Asia.\u201d Best of WWD","filter_flag":1}

In this article we\u2019ll discuss the first of the above, namely the environment, and how it relates to the Metaverse and Web3. A new form of efficiency thanks to the Metaverse The concept of efficiency goes beyond economic costs, as there\u2019s also another definition of efficiency (even more important for some people) associated with the environmental impact that we generate, be it that of a large company, an SME or even a family. One of the most positive impacts of the Metaverse with respect to environmental efficiency is related to reduced travel. The Metaverse enables us to carry out activities that normally take place in person in the real world, such as going to work, attending international congresses, travelling to conventions and concerts and so on, in a completely virtual environment from the office or the living room at home. This significantly helps us to reduce the tonnes of greenhouse gases that we normally generate when we travel by car, train or plane. One example is Movistar Immersive Experience (MEI), a new way of interacting with our Movistar world and our loved ones in a more immersive manner, together with Telef\u00f3nica Theme Park and Telef\u00f3nica World, virtual experiences that include fair games and attending events. Telef\u00f3nica promotes sustainability by means of the Metaverse by allowing us to visit a work of art such as Okuda at MEI from home without going to the museum, displaying Movistar\u2019s products and services in our virtual store and enabling us to attend the MWC from the sofa by means of the \u201cmetaversistic\u201d recreation of our physical stand, as well as events such as Metaverse Day from home with our Talent & Innovation Hub. The three Rs of recycling: reduce, reuse and recycle Web3 goes hand in hand with the concept of server decentralisation. This facilitates improved resource management, as we can manage energy efficiency and even automatically allocate energy in keeping with demand, thus reducing energy consumption. Moreover, thanks to tokenisation projects, tokens generated by the user can be converted into credits to offset the carbon footprint of various forestry projects, with several different initiatives. One example applied to the home is the App Compensa tu Huella available in the \u201cApps\u201d section of Movistar Plus+, helping us to offset the amount of CO2 generated in our home. This programme converts the use of Movistar\u2019s digital environment into tokens redeemable for exclusive rewards: data allowances, monthly subscriptions to Movistar Plus+ channels, film rentals and even Movistar LaLiga and the Champions League. When we refer to Web3, we shouldn\u2019t forget blockchain technology, which helps us to decentralise the above-mentioned servers, also serves as a tool for transparency and traceability, enabling us to track each phase accurately and simply in the life of both products and services (production, storage, transport, use and reuse). This is why Telef\u00f3nica has teamed up with the Celo non-profit organisation, which manages the development of blockchain while being carbon negative. At the same time, Telef\u00f3nica has also become a member of the \u201cCelo Alliance for Prosperity\u201d, which seeks to increase sustainability and financial inclusion through an open source, accessible and decentralised blockchain ecosystem. Telef\u00f3nica reuses its extensive network infrastructure, thus playing a key role as a transaction validator and facilitating the stability and security of blockchains. Also, thanks to Web3 smart contracts are also possible. These can automatically manage the sorting and recycling of waste to ensure they are done properly. A new technology, new sustainability As you\u2019ve seen, this new technological world is full of potential, but the relationship between innovation and sustainability will only be positive if projects like the Metaverse and Web3 also focus on being environment friendly. Telef\u00f3nica believes that there can be no progress without caring for the environment and, for this reason and many others, it participates in the GSMA Open Gateway initiative, which is laying the foundations for the networks of tomorrow to make them globally more efficient and enable us to reduce the number of servers that pollute, reuse APIs and drive future development and innovation.","filter_flag":1}

Independently, the development of the new LCmax energy-saving needles took place. The focus of both developments is on efficiency, energy savings and increased process reliability. Groz-Beckert offers interested machine builders different cooperation options to jointly develop new products or optimise existing ones. The Groz-Beckert Technology and Development Center (TEZ) provides the appropriate framework for so-called co-development projects. At ITMA in Milan in June 2023, Groz-Beckert presented some of the successful cooperations under the motto \u2018Innovation through cooperation\u2019. Amongst these were two new developments realised with Mayer & Cie. Groz-Beckert also presented the two new products for the first time in Asia at ITMA Asia in November 2023. Optimised Relanit sinker SNK F At the end of 2018, circular knitting machine manufacturer Mayer & Cie. approached Groz-Beckert with a request to jointly develop an improved and more efficient sinker for selected machines of their Relanit family that would run more smoothly and reliably in the needle tricks. The innovative sinker has an integral spring with a spring force that is adapted to the sinker thickness. Field tests were consistently successful and confirmed the functionality and advantages of the new sinker. Thanks to their unique, adapted spring, the newly developed SNK F Relanit sinkers are securely guided while they are running through the cam track, resulting in a quieter operation. This increases process reliability and ensures an improved loop structure. In addition, wear on the swivel butts of the sinkers is reduced. This increases service life and makes the process more sustainable and cost-efficient. Higher energy efficiency thanks to LCmax The second recent cooperation with Mayer & Cie. was initiated by Groz-Beckert. With its products, Groz-Beckert strives to provide textile producers with the best possible support in meeting the constantly growing demands for sustainable production. Accordingly, the topic of sustainability has always been a focus of new and further developments at Groz-Beckert. The objective was to develop a cost-effective energy-saving needle. After considering various variants, the common choice of Mayer & Cie. and Groz-Beckert was the LCmax knitting machine needle with innovative, wave-shaped shank geometry. The first prototypes were extensively tested on laboratory machines at Groz-Beckert's TEZ. The trials confirmed the advantages of the new technology. The innovative, wave-shaped shank of the LCmax needle ensures a smaller contact area of the needle in the needle trick. This results in less friction, which reduces machine temperature and enables energy savings of up to 20% compared to a standard needle. This saves costs and at the same time allows operation of the machine at the maximum possible speed. In both projects, the cooperation between Mayer & Cie. and Groz-Beckert went far beyond mere product development. In addition to Applications Engineering and Construction, the companies' Sales and Purchasing departments were also involved in a close exchange. The cooperation at all levels was characterised by openness, constructiveness, partnership and goal orientation, and led to successful results from which the customers of both companies can now benefit. Groz-Beckert Groz-Beckert is the world's leading supplier of industrial machine needles, precision parts and fine tools, as well as systems and services for the production and joining of textile fabrics. Its products and services support the fields of knitting, weaving, felting, tufting, carding and sewing. Groz-Beckert is part of the Groz-Beckert Group, a market leader in the development, manufacture and distribution of process-critical textile precision tools, industrial cutting solutions and solution provider for textile construction and reinforcement solutions made from high-performance technical fibres for composite materials. The group consists of the companies Groz-Beckert, TKM and solidian and generated sales of 814 million euros in 2022 with around 9,500 employees worldwide. The company is active in more than 150 countries with agencies, production and sales subsidiaries. Mayer & Cie. Mayer & Cie. (MCT) is a leading global manufacturer of circular knitting machines. The company offers the full range of machines required for the production of modern textiles \u2013 from fabrics for home textiles, sportswear, nightwear and swimwear, seat covers and underwear to technical textiles. In addition, Mayer & Cie. regularly develops new approaches. Since 2019, Mayer & Cie.'s service portfolio has been supplemented by the production of braiding machines. These are used to produce sheathing for hydraulic hoses, for example for use in aviation, the automotive industry or other, special niche applications. Founded in 1905, Mayer & Cie. generated a turnover of around 110 million euros in 2022 with a workforce of around 450, of which approximately 350 are based at the Albstadt site. In addition to its headquarters in Albstadt in Germany and its subsidiaries in China and the Czech Republic, Mayer & Cie. is represented in a total of around 80 countries via its sales partners in the circular knitting and braiding machine sectors. www.mayercie.com www.groz-beckert.com","filter_flag":1}

Harris, 59, was roasted over the post, with many conservatives accusing her of \u201chypocrisy.\u201d \u201cWait\u2026that\u2019s a gas stove! The same kind Dems want to BAN you from owning,\u201d Sen Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote on X. \u201cGas stoves for me but not for thee,\u201d Senate GOP staffer Charles Correll III tweeted. \u201cI thought gas stoves were bad for the environment,\u201d actor Kevin Sorbo said, noting the impetus behind banning the stoves and other natural-gas-powered appliances in Democrat-controlled California cities such as San Francisco and Berkeley. The White House says President Biden would not support a federal gas stove ban \u2014 the appliance veep Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were pictured in front of on Thanksgiving. Vice President Kamala Harris\/X In January, concerns over a possible federal ban on gas stoves were sparked after a Biden administration appointee suggested that a gas stove ban was \u201con the table,\u201d supposedly because of the potentially dangerous levels of toxic chemicals emitted by the popular appliances. \u201cThis is a hidden hazard,\u201d Richard Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cAny option is on the table. Products that can\u2019t be made safe can be banned.\u201d Trumka Jr., the son of the late AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka, later walked back his remarks. \u201cTo be clear, CPSC isn\u2019t coming for anyone\u2019s gas stoves,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cRegulations apply to new products.\u201d The chairman of the CPSC also distanced himself from Trumka Jr.\u2019s initial claim. \u201cI am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so,\u201d Alex Hoehn-Saric, one of the five members on the commission, said. Likewise, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in January that \u201cthe president does not support banning gas stoves.\u201d A Biden administration official floated banning gas stoves earlier this year before walking back his remarks. AFP via Getty Images The Republican-led House passed a bill in June that would prevent the CPSC from finalizing any rule banning gas stoves. Only 29 Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Concerns were reignited in February after the Department of Energy proposed an \u201cenergy efficiency standard\u201d for gas cooking products. The proposed regulation would require an energy performance standard for residential cooktops for the first time ever. The DOE derided suggestions that the new rule would lead to gas stove bans as \u201cabsurd.\u201d \u201cNeither DOE nor the federal government plans to ban gas stoves. In February 2023, DOE published a proposal that would improve efficiency of gas and electric stoves. If implemented, the standards would not go into effect until 2027 and help U.S. consumers save up to $1.7 billion. As required by congressional mandate, DOE is determined to ensure consumers have multiple options that are both cost-effective and energy efficient,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told congressional lawmakers in March that about half of gas cooktops currently on the market would be affected by the proposed rule \u2013 those that are \u201chigh-end\u201d with \u201cheavy grates\u201d and oval-shaped burners, which she claimed lead to \u201can excess amount of natural gas to be emitted relative to the pot that\u2019s on there.\u201d Granholm noted that it would cost about $12 per appliance to bring them into compliance with the proposed regulation. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation in April that requires all new buildings under seven stories to be fully electric by 2026 with larger structures following three years later \u2014 an effective ban on gas stoves.","filter_flag":1}

The most advanced RAN Compute products to date are powered by Ericsson Silicon and built for the network demands of 5G Advanced and enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Ericsson\u2019s next-generation RAN Compute portfolio includes four products with high and standard capacity variants, and with both enclosure and outdoor formats, to cater to varying site needs. The new RAN Compute products are also hardware prepared for Open RAN deployments. The two high-capacity processors, RAN Processor 6672 and Radio Processor 6372, offer four times the capacity compared to previous generation and can support up to six 4G and 5G modes, in a single unit. Advanced 5G markets typically utilize three to four modes in basebands at present. The additional modes made possible by the products announced today will allow CSPs to run more technologies simultaneously on one RAN Compute board, including 5G time division duplex (TDD) Massive MIMO, 4G and 5G frequency division duplex (FDD), and more, with modes to spare for future needs. A keystone to the cutting-edge network processing power and benefits achieved in the latest products is Ericsson Silicon, the company\u2019s range of system-on-a-chip, which is at the heart of the Ericsson Radio System. It is built on a custom-made, flexible and modular architecture, which is what enables the existing RAN Compute portfolio to consume 30 to 60 percent less power compared to industry benchmarks. Ericsson is working with Intel as key partner for this new generation of RAN Compute products, utilizing Intel 4 technology, as the two companies continue to build on their strategic collaboration. The pressure on mobile networks is rapidly increasing with the growth of 5G. Emerging 5G Advanced applications such as extended reality (XR) use cases will also add to the already booming traffic growth, increasing the demands on the network both in the downlink and uplink. Efficient spectrum use and intelligence are key to boosting network capacity, reducing cost of ownership and automating manual tasks. On the RAN software front, Ericsson will also debut two new features - Automated Carrier Aggregation and Carrier Aggregation Data Steering - to optimize spectrum utilization and drastically reduce operational costs. Also introduced in this launch are two new high-capacity, energy-efficient routers that have been added to the Router 6000 family. Both Router 6678 and 6671 have built-in intelligence for AI-analytics and automation, which can be leveraged through the new Ericsson Transport Automation Controller unveiled earlier today. These enhancements of the Ericsson router portfolio address the new requirements and capabilities that the new RAN Compute portfolio introduces for both distributed and centralized RAN deployments. As the industry works toward scaling 5G coverage and preparing networks for a surge in uplink demand, it is important to also keep in mind its Net Zero goals. The launch of this latest RAN Compute portfolio is part of Ericsson\u2019s commitment to developing solutions for the high performing, open and sustainable networks of the future, paving the path to limitless connectivity. Michael Begley, Head of RAN Compute, Ericsson, Our new and enhanced RAN Compute portfolio was designed with Ericsson\u2019s customers and their future needs in mind. It both addresses their need to maximize spectrum utilization and facilitates their desire to future-proof their networks with support for Open RAN architectures. The focus on innovation and energy efficiency while reducing both footprint and total cost of ownership has resulted in powerful hardware and software that is both reliable and flexible. Nikos Katinakis, Telstra Group Executive for Global Networks & Technology, Telstra and Ericsson have a long history of working on innovative technologies to deploy a multi-layer 5G network. The new Automated Carrier Aggregation functionality will help increase the operational efficiency and performance of our 5G network by automatically configuring the best frequency bands for carrier aggregation. We look forward to seeing this software feature deployed in our network, to continue bringing Telstra customers the best available 5G experience.","filter_flag":1}

Global temperatures have been steadily rising and the science is really clear about this. So it's emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity and industrialization that causing our climate to change. At the heart of this is our over reliance on fossil fuels, including those that were used to heat our homes. So if we want to address the climate emergency and stop global temperature rising any further, 0:35 what we need to do is to drastically reduce our emissions. So there's 30 million homes in the UK 0:42 and it's the oldest housing stock in Europe 0:46 and that results in around 16% of UK emissions coming from those homes and 35% of energy use. 0:56 So clearly it's a big contributor to UK emissions. 1:02 And clearly there's a there's a that means that there's a 1:07 a lot they can be done, not just to reduce emissions, but to help households reduce their energy bills. A really good way is to get started is to check what the energy efficiency of your property currently is. 1:21 Halifax and Lloyds actually already have a tool in partnership with Energy Saving Trust, so it can help provide a personalised action plan. And what this will help to do is it will provide estimates of the Homes Energy Performance Certificate. That's the we call that the EPC. So there's a rating which will estimate the energy costs and also the carbon emissions relating to that home at the moment. 1:41 That will produce a range of options. Now not all of these have to mean expensive technologies and there are a number of low cost options that people can install including energy efficient lighting, so LED light bulbs, draught proofing, which is one of the most effective things that people can do quickly. Heating controls such as smart thermostats and also insulating hot water tanks. And there are other improvements that require a bit more investment. So insulating walls, insulating floors, roofs, loft spaces and solar panels. So rooftop renewables, installing electric charging point if you've got an electric vehicle and then 2:16 all the way down to installing low carbon heating, which is expensive but is going to dramatically cut your emissions in the long term. So that's something like a heat pump. But by far the biggest challenge for that people have told us that they find is a cost. So 50% of people that responded to our recent survey said the cost of carrying out the work was by far the biggest, biggest barrier to making change. Really complex process for people. And it's not something that we should expect people to be experts in because it's not something that people are going to do every day, all the time. So being 2:51 able to have that support and knowing where to be able to start in the process is really important. It's absolutely vital that we also communicate what the benefits are, not only just of lowering costs. So we're all worrying about our energy bills, right? Energy has gone up a lot over the last couple of years and particularly last year. But we also need to be able to be able to communicate the benefits of our net zero future as well. So we need to be able to engage with people. And we know it's possible. We've already got all the technology that we need to be able to do it, but we can get there much, much faster if we're engaging people and having them informed about what they need to do. 3:25 So overall, we're going to need a lot more investment across the whole economy to generate more clean energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. It's fossil fuels that are at the heart of the issue, really. And it's also important to remember that the lowest cost energy that we have is the energy that we don't use in the 1st place. So there's a really big case for reducing demand for energy in the 1st place. So investment in both of these areas will be far cheaper than doing nothing at all. It will cost us much less if we act now. So while all this may sound like a lot, the cost of ignoring the climate emergency is going to be far higher for us. Trillions of pounds, 4:00 according to some of the estimates and so and there's also a human cost. So all our lives are going to be impacted by climate change, not just here, but all around the world as well. 4:11 ","filter_flag":1}

Independently of this, the development of the new LCmax\u2122 energy-saving needles took place. The focus of both developments is on efficiency, energy savings and increased process reliability. Groz-Beckert offers interested machine builders different cooperation options to jointly develop new products or optimize existing ones. The Groz-Beckert Technology and Development Center (TEZ) provides the appropriate framework for so-called co-development projects. At the ITMA in Milan in June 2023, Groz-Beckert presented some of the successful cooperations under the motto \u201cInnovation through cooperation\u201d. Among them were two new developments realized with Mayer & Cie. Groz-Beckert presented the two new products for the first time in Asia at ITMA Asia in November 2023. Optimized Relanit sinker SNK-F At the end of 2018, circular knitting machine manufacturer Mayer & Cie. approached Groz-Beckert with a request to jointly develop an improved and more efficient sinker for selected machines of their Relanit family that would run more smoothly and reliably in the needle tricks. The innovative sinker has an integral spring with a spring force that is adapted to the sinker thickness. Field tests were consistently successful and confirmed the functionality and advantages of the new sinker. Thanks to their unique, adapted spring, the newly developed SNK-F Relanit Sinkers are securely guided while they are running through the cam track, resulting in a quieter operation. This increases process reliability and ensures an improved loop structure. In addition, wear on the swivel butts of the sinkers is reduced. This increases service life and makes the process more sustainable and cost-efficient. Higher energy efficiency thanks to LCmax\u2122 The second recent cooperation with Mayer & Cie. was initiated by Groz-Beckert. With its products, Groz-Beckert strives to provide textile producers with the best possible support in meeting the constantly growing demands for sustainable production. Accordingly, the topic of sustainability has always been a focus of new and further developments at Groz-Beckert. The objective was to develop a cost-effective energy-saving needle. After considering various variants, the common choice of Mayer & Cie. and Groz-Beckert was the LCmax\u2122 knitting machine needle with innovative, wave-shaped shank geometry. The first prototypes were extensively tested on laboratory machines at Groz-Beckert\u2019s TEZ. The trials confirmed the advantages of the new technology. The innovative, wave-shaped shank of the LCmax\u2122 needle ensures a smaller contact area of the needle in the needle trick. This results in less friction, which reduces machine temperature and enables energy savings of up to 20 percent compared to a standard needle. This saves costs and at the same time allows operation of the machine at the maximum possible speed. In both projects, the cooperation between Mayer & Cie. and Groz-Beckert went far beyond mere product development. In addition to Applications Engineering and Construction, the companies\u2019 Sales and Purchasing departments were also involved in a close exchange. The cooperation at all levels was characterized by openness, constructiveness, partnership and goal orientation, and led to successful results from which the customers of both companies can now benefit.","filter_flag":1}

The consultation document sets out proposals for a new fabric rating to be introduced, which social housing will need to meet by 2033, and for the replacement of fossil fuel gas and electric heating systems with clean heat alternatives by 2045, such as heat pumps or solar thermal heating. A consultation on Heat in Buildings for the wider housing sector has also been launched at the same time, which will introduce the same backstop of 2045 for the transition to clean heat. Speaking to Scottish Housing News this morning, Mr Harvie said the proposals deliver the certainty and long-term planning that social landlords, developers and other impacted parties have long called for. \u201cWe know where we need to get to by 2045,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just high performance in terms of energy standards and energy efficiency, but shifting away from fossil fuel for the way we heat our buildings. But we can\u2019t wait until 2044 to see an impossible bottleneck, we need to give a clear sense of the direction of travel and confidence that this will continue to accelerate.\u201d \u201cIt has been accelerating, but we need to continue that trend progressively and we need businesses that housing developers work with, whether they are housebuilders themselves or other contractors, to have the confidence to invest in the skills and the capacity. We need to make it very clear to anyone who is looking at investing in the green transition that Scotland\u2019s a great place to put your money and to build a business, whether innovating new products onto the market that will achieve the heat transition more affordably or just scaling up. \u201cIn the construction sector, we\u2019re already seeing changes of attitude and a lot less resistance to ambitious change than might have been the case 10 or 20 years ago. I think the construction sector knows that change is coming so we are working with the grain of that.\u201d Heat in Buildings Bill As part of the Heat in Buildings Bill, Mr Harvie admitted that an initial target for one million homes to have low or zero-emission heating by 2030 is \u201cunachievable\u201d and will not be met until later in the decade. And while most of the timescales set out in his initial strategy in 2021 remain intact, the phasing out of fossil fuel heating systems for off-gas homes, which were initially set to make changes from 2025, will now align with the majority of properties that are on gas mains supply. Under the plans, all homes will need to end their use of fossil fuel emission heating systems by 2045, when Scotland is due to become net zero in law. Proposals in the Heating and Buildings Bill include: That private rented homes will be required to meet a minimum energy efficiency standard no later than 2028; That owner-occupied homes will be required to meet the same minimum energy efficiency standard by the end of 2033; That all homes and non-domestic buildings will be required to end their use of polluting heating by the end of 2045; and In order to create a smooth trajectory towards 2045, that those purchasing a home or non-domestic property before 2045 would be required to end their use of polluting heating systems within a specific period following that purchase. Mr Harvie said the changes have made the proposals \u201cfairer and clearer\u201d. \u201cAll the key dates that we set out in the 2021 strategy are still in place, what we have had to do is refine the expectation about how much of that heat transition we can achieve by 2030,\u201d he told SHN. \u201cAnd we recognise that more of that will happen in the early 2030s than by 2030.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is to take account of several things. Partly it\u2019s the cost of living crisis, which is also the cost of doing business crisis. We know that construction is a sector where inflation has hit particularly hard, as well as the challenges in terms of labour supply post-Brexit, but we\u2019ve also had to take into account the way that Westminster announcements have undermined investment throughout the UK. \u201cSo we recognise that that goal of a million by 2030 is not the realistic path anymore and that we\u2019re likely to see those kind of numbers enter the early 2030s instead of by 2030. But it doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the trajectory that we\u2019re on or indeed the actions that we need to take to support everyone whether its large-scale social landlords, community organisations, the construction industry itself, or indeed householders, and landlords.\u201d The announcement of a proposed Social Housing Net Zero Standard, and its focus on a fabric efficiency rating, comes in response to a report by the Zero Emissions Social Housing Taskforce (ZEST) which called for an accelerated review of the Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing (EESSH2), and alignment with Heat in Buildings to provide clarity for social landlords to guide retrofit and investment planning. By setting out two options for the fabric efficiency rating in the consultation, Mr Harvie was asked whether the proposals will provide adequate incentive for landlords to carry out the most expensive upgrades. \u201cWell, very clearly there\u2019s been a great deal asked of the social housing sector in particular,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019ve already led the way in energy efficiency but a whole host of other quality standards have improved and need to continue to improve and we\u2019re looking to make sure that we offer a coherent package of what\u2019s being asked rather than asking the impossible. \u201cWe want to make sure that this is an achievable deliverable change, and that it can be done in the way that best suits the investment plans that each landlord will have. They will know their housing stock, they will know what their priorities are both in terms of retrofit and new supply and we know that we\u2019ll need to make sure that the way that we support investment through the specific Social Housing Net Zero Fund, and the way that we support housing providers to do new supply - they need to fit together as well. \u201cI think offering some flexibility is the most effective way of getting results for people who are going to be living in those homes and paying their energy bills. But it\u2019s also really consistent, I think, with the long-term direction of travel. We need to see fabric improvements, we also need to see by 2045, the end of fossil fuel heating systems and I think the package that we put out yesterday is a bold package, and one that can be a template for the rest of the UK.\u201d Financial support On how to finance the transition, Mr Harvie said it was unrealistic not to proceed with the consultation until a clearer picture of all potential funding streams were in place. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that all of this will continue to develop over time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about more than 20 years\u2019 worth of work and just as I think it would be unreasonable for me to say that the package of individual householders support that we have, generous though it is at the moment, that it\u2019s never going to change, of course it\u2019s going to have to change and refine over time to meet the changing circumstances. So the way that we support the social housing sector is also going to have to change over time. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be right to say that we\u2019re not going to proceed with the consultation until we have every answer to every detail, because we\u2019ll never be in that position. These aspects about how we\u2019re going to fund the work that\u2019s going to happen are going to continue to change over time. Take something like heat networks, for example, social landlords could be really pivotal organisations in providing demand assurance for heat networks, so that the investors know that there are the buildings, the homes and the customers to connect to those networks. That, criticality, is going to make those networks viable. \u201cOver time we\u2019re going to be seeing continued innovation in how we bring together a range of different sources of investment from the social landlords investment programme, through individual building owners, through energy companies, financial products like green mortgages, and institutional investors that are interested in things like heat networks.\u201d Sector response Sally Thomas, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) CEO, who co-chaired ZEST, said it welcomes any consultation geared towards lowering energy costs for social housing tenants. Ms Thomas added: \u201cOur social homes are already some of the most energy-efficient in Scotland and as a sector we are fully committed to tackling the climate emergency and meeting the country\u2019s net-zero targets. This consultation is an important step in ensuring those targets are fair, affordable and deliverable. \u201cThere are approximately 600,000 homes in the Scottish social housing sector, with 500,000 gas boilers which will need to be changed by 2045 to clean heating systems. Social housing therefore has a vital contribution to make to meeting Scotland\u2019s climate change targets, but it must be adequately supported to do so. \u201cWe have been clear from the outset that the costs of this transition must not impact on our members\u2019 ability to maintain affordable rents for their tenants and build the new social homes our country needs, so it\u2019s important now that the Scottish Government also outlines how we will adequately fund the transition to clean heat.\u201d The Glasgow and West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations (GWSF) said there won\u2019t be a just transition without substantial financial support. Colleen Rowan, research and policy lead at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations (GWSF), said: \u201cGWSF very much welcomes the consultation, and the opportunities we\u2019ve had to input via the EESSH2 Review Group. Tackling fuel poverty and reducing carbon emissions are both big priorities for our members. \u201cThe consultation on a standard for the property fabric suggests two alternatives, with one markedly less ambitious than the other because it\u2019s spread over a much longer timescale. In an ideal world, our members would want to be really positive and to see the more ambitious target adopted. \u201cBut if it\u2019s primarily tenants\u2019 rent that has to fund our ambitiousness, there won\u2019t be the \u2018just transition\u2019 ministers rightly want. Without a programme of grant subsidy similar to the one in place for new build, progress in improving energy efficiency is likely to be much slower than we would want, and in turn, that would also mean a slower transition to renewable heating.\u201d The Existing Homes Alliance welcomed the consultations as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d. Lori McElroy, chair, said: \u201cThis consultation is a welcome step in the right direction \u2013 clear standards and regulations are a core part of the package needed to ensure Scotland\u2019s homes are warm and more affordable to heat. They will help homeowners and landlords understand what they need to do to improve their homes over the coming years. \u201cImproving the energy efficiency of homes is key to reducing energy bills and by switching to zero emissions heating we can end households\u2019 exposure to unstable fossil fuel prices \u2013 helping to lift people out of fuel poverty. \u201cAs demonstrated in a recent letter to the First Minister signed by over 30 industry organisations, businesses are ready and willing to help meet the climate challenge but they need certainty. Clarity on standards and timescales will give businesses a clear pipeline of work, allowing them to scale up to meet growing demand. \u201cHowever, regulations won\u2019t work on their own \u2013 they need to be accompanied by expanded advice and support services. We can learn from what is happening in other countries already, for example Ireland, where there is a network of one-stop shops which support people through the whole installation service. \u201cThe Scottish Government must also move quickly on the recommendations of the Green Heat Finance Taskforce to develop mechanisms such as property linked finance so that warm homes with clean heating are affordable to all.\u201d Consumer Scotland head of energy Kate Morrison said: \u201cRecent research published by Consumer Scotland found most consumers are concerned about climate change and want to do more to address it, but 67% of consumers either didn\u2019t know or were unsure what they had to do to transition to net zero. \u201cThe consultation represents the start of this discussion, helping consumers to understand what will be expected of them and the routes they can take to decarbonise their homes. \u201cConsumer Scotland will engage with the consultation to ensure that fairness in decision making and a strong focus on the consumer is embedded into the drafting of the Bill.\u201d British heat pump manufacturer Kensa welcomed the Scottish Government\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d proposals. Group CEO Tamsin Lishman said: \u201cAs a proud Scot, I warmly welcome the launch of the Scottish Government\u2019s consultation on proposals for a Heat in Buildings Bill - this Bill is urgently needed to provide clear legislation to support the decarbonisation of buildings across Scotland. \u201cHeating is the third-largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland, upgrading our homes to clean, efficient zero-emissions heating is therefore absolutely essential if Scotland is to meet its climate change targets, tackle fuel poverty and achieve energy security. \u201cThe Scottish Government\u2019s proposals could be a major step in the right direction for the heat pump sector, setting out that by 2045, all building owners will need to stop using polluting heating. \u201cIf the Scottish Government is to achieve this laudable aim, it must consider the use of all available heat pump technologies, such as networked heat pumps. This established approach, with a heat pump in each home connected to a third-party network in the road, will ensure all homes, from tenements to terraces to tower blocks, are able to access sustainable and affordable heat. \u201cUnrolling this technology on a street-by-street basis will require a more strategic approach to that taken to date, but the benefits are clear \u2013 lower energy consumption, lower energy bills, and an easier path to net zero. I look forward to responding to this consultation and working with the Scottish Government to make this a reality.\u201d The proposals have also been welcomed by the Scottish Government\u2019s statutory advisers, the Climate Change Committee. Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, said: \u201cThese are bold proposals to decarbonise Scotland\u2019s buildings over the next two decades. They recognise the importance of a long-term plan for low-carbon heat, with a very welcome focus on upgrading properties at the point of sale. \u201cThere is also greater clarity on the role of low-carbon heat networks and tougher obligations on landlords to upgrade the energy efficiency of their properties. If adopted, these proposals could become a template for other parts of the UK.\u201d But concerns have been raised about the costs involved, with no clarity given by Mr Harvie over how the bulk of the \u00a333 billion bill to decarbonise Scotland\u2019s buildings will be paid \u2013 with an expectation it will largely come from the private sector. Scottish Labour net zero spokesperson Sarah Boyack said: \u201cIt\u2019s been two years since the first draft heat in buildings strategy was published for consultation, but the government\u2019s plans are still in chaos. Timescales are slipping, basic questions have not been answered, and we still have no idea how this \u00a333bn plan will actually be paid for. \u201cEnergy bills are through the roof and fuel poverty is at appalling levels \u2013 we urgently need a real plan to make homes more energy efficient, but last year the Snp-green government failed to spend \u00a3133m of budgeted energy-efficiency funding. Scots need warm homes, not warm words, and the Snp-green government must show some leadership to deliver it.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
