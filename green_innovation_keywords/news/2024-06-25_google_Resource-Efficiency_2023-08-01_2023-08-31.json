A six-foot-tall interactive jukebox invited passersby to listen to \u201crecycled records\u201d \u2014 seven audio tracks that, according to Coca-Cola, represent the world\u2019s first album made with recordings of the plastic recycling process. The project, produced for Coca-Cola by the DJs Mark Ronson and Madlib, was meant to celebrate Coke\u2019s decision to move from green to clear plastic bottles for three of its brands: Sprite, Fresca, and Seagram\u2019s. Because clear plastic bottles are easier to recycle than green ones, Coca-Cola said they would advance a \u201cclosed-loop bottle-to-bottle economy\u201d that uses materials more efficiently and creates less waste. \u201cGreen plastic gets stuck in single-use ruts,\u201d the company proclaims. \u201cClear plastic unlocks loops as sweet as donuts.\u201d Green and clear drink bottles are packed and wrapped in plastic. Amir Mukhtar via Getty Images It was just one of many creative displays at Circularity 23, an annual conference whose objective is to accelerate the \u201ccircular economy,\u201d a term that generally refers to market systems that minimize raw resource extraction and waste. For two and a half days, 1,400 attendees \u2014 mostly from the world of corporate sustainability \u2014 wandered the halls of the Hyatt Regency hotel in Seattle, where companies like Coca-Cola were promoting their own ostensibly circular business practices. Many of these involved plastic: \u201creclaiming\u201d it from rivers to create disposable mailing envelopes, melting it into its chemical building blocks so it can (theoretically) be used again, advertising its recyclability with QR codes on labels.

Here's How Circular messaging was everywhere \u2014 understandably, given the name of the conference. But what was harder to find was a succinct definition of the word: What exactly is circularity, and what makes a product or practice circular? \u201cI came away from the conference feeling like circularity has become synonymous with recycling, like we\u2019ve lost the true definition,\u201d said Sarah King, the head of Greenpeace Canada\u2019s oceans and plastics campaign and one of a few environmental advocates who attended the event. Her concerns reflect a broader uneasiness within the environmental community about the way corporations have rallied around circularity, aggressively embracing it in their communications but not necessarily living up to its standards in practice. Coca-Cola\u2019s clear plastic bottles, for instance, are a form of disposable plastic \u2014 made out of oil and gas, designed for just a few minutes of use, unlikely to be recycled, and fundamentally toxic to people and the environment. It\u2019s also worth noting that an environmental group\u2019s audit has found Coca-Cola to be the world\u2019s biggest contributor to plastic litter every year for the past five years. (Coca-Cola did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment.) A Coca-Cola food stall sign touts recycled bottles in the stadium of the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. Catherine Ivill \/ Getty Images Some groups like Just Zero, a nonprofit that advocates for waste reduction, have dropped the term \u201ccircular economy\u201d altogether. \u201cThe phrase is now being used to serve the interests of the huge corporations that are damaging our climate and spewing toxics into our communities,\u201d said Kevin Budris, Just Zero\u2019s advocacy director. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How \u201cAt this point,\u201d he added, \u201cany time I hear the phrase \u2018circular economy\u2019 I assume that it\u2019s greenwashing.\u201d The idea of a circular economy has its roots in the environmental scholarship of the 1960s and \u201970s. Writings like \u201cThe Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth,\u201d published in 1966 by the American economist Kenneth Boulding, warned that ever-growing demand for resources could not be sustained on a finite planet. They advocated for a closed-loop system in which all resources are conserved. These concepts resonated in a nascent environmental movement that sought to restore humans\u2019 relationship with nature. In addition to the general environmental calamities of the 1960s through \u201980s \u2014 oil spills in California, a polluted river that repeatedly caught on fire in Cleveland \u2014 the 1973 oil embargo by Middle Eastern states highlighted Western countries\u2019 crippling dependence on nonrenewable resources. Though it\u2019s unclear who first used the term \u201ccircular economy\u201d \u2014 some say it was the British economists David Pearce and R. Kerry Turner in the \u201980s \u2014 environmentalists were thinking critically about resource conservation and the limits to growth. (Incidentally, that was the title of a popular book published in 1972 by MIT researchers, which discussed the need to live within planetary boundaries by reaching an \u201cequilibrium society.\u201d) Over the next several decades, however, the notion of a circular economy evolved into something more market-oriented. It came to prominence alongside increasingly popular ideas about \u201cgreen growth\u201d and \u201csustainable development,\u201d which accepted the premise that resources must be used efficiently, but stopped short of renouncing growth. The circular economy was seen as a kind of compromise: Conserve resources, but don\u2019t sacrifice profit. This has made the concept extremely popular, both in the corporate world and on the international stage. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, or EMF \u2014 a nonprofit formed in 2010 to promote the circular economy \u2014 published a report in 2015 saying that a circular economy could \u201cdecouple global economic development from finite resource consumption.\u201d That same year, the European Commission launched its first-ever \u201ccircular economy action plan,\u201d which laid out dozens of actions that the European Union could take to promote \u201csustainable consumption and production patterns.\u201d More recently, the World Economic Forum, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Biden administration, the Chinese government, and dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of smaller state, regional, and city-level governments have also claimed to back some version of a circular economy. However, precise definitions of the circular economy have been hard to nail down. EMF\u2019s 2015 report said it could be \u201ccharacterized, more than defined,\u201d while broadly advocating for resource efficiency \u2014 whether by extending products\u2019 lifetimes through maintenance and repair or by reusing materials through refurbishment. It described a hierarchy of ways to keep materials in circulation \u201cat their highest utility and value,\u201d with recycling as a last resort when other options had been exhausted. \u201cThe circular economy is a new paradigm for our whole economic system, which makes it really hard to define in one sentence or paragraph,\u201d said Sander Defruyt, who leads an EMF initiative on plastics. A woman in Bangladesh sifts through waste to be used for making plastic goods after recycling. Sony Ramany \/ NurPhoto via Getty Images Other explanations of circularity are similarly imprecise, with a tendency to say what a circular economy does or involves rather than what it is. At Circularity 23, for example, instead of defining the circular economy, most speakers gave examples that seemed to vaguely embody its ideals, like buying secondhand clothes or growing new green onions from the roots of those you buy at the store. In a keynote address, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell used it to talk about his parents\u2019 frugal shopping habits. (\u201cWe wasted nothing in the Harrell house,\u201d he told the crowd, because his father was always \u201ctight with the money.\u201d) In another speech, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee broadened things even further by insisting that the circular economy should apply not only to physical materials, but also to the \u201cjoules and ergs of energy\u201d captured by renewables. \u201cEveryone is talking about the circular economy, but nobody seems to know what it means,\u201d said Vito Bounsante, technical and policy adviser for the nonprofit International Pollutants Elimination Network. In Europe, where the EU has made billions of euros available for governments, businesses, organizations, and academics to advance its circular economy action plan, he described a cynical, opportunistic scramble to use the term for attention and cash. \u201cJust put the words \u2018circular economy\u2019 in your funding proposal, and you\u2019ll get the money,\u201d he said. In theory, the circular economy captures all three R\u2019s of the simple waste-management hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle. But corporate visions of the concept tend to focus on the third R, and mostly for plastics. Indeed, there\u2019s a feeling among environmental groups that the very term \u201ccircular economy\u201d has become a kind of code for \u201cmore plastics recycling.\u201d This was apparent at Circularity 23, where speakers spent panel after panel wringing their hands over \u201chard-to-recycle\u201d plastics: things like bags, wrappers, and films, which are typically not accepted by the facilities that sort and process materials for recycling. Environmental groups argue there\u2019s a simple solution to this glut of stuff: \u201cStop using it,\u201d according to Judith Enck, president of the advocacy group Beyond Plastics and a former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency. Advocates say manufacturers should rethink product delivery systems so they don\u2019t rely on packaging at all, or can work with an alternative that isn\u2019t made from plastic. But those solutions were far from many conference-goers\u2019 minds. Instead, they justified plastic packaging on social justice grounds (\u201cIt helps make products more accessible to developing economies,\u201d as one chemical company executive put it) and heralded the promise of chemical recycling, a controversial technology that melts plastic into polymers that can theoretically be turned into new products. An assortment of candies covered in plastic film. UCG \/ Getty Images \u201cWe are pushing chemical recycling because we see that there are materials that can\u2019t be recycled without it,\u201d one panelist said, citing her company\u2019s \u201csalty snacks\u201d packaging as an example. Defenders argue that chemical recycling could make plastics as circular as glass and aluminum, which are considered to be \u201cinfinitely recyclable.\u201d (Unlike plastic, they can be recycled again and again into the same products without degrading.) Even the United Nations Environment Programme has endorsed chemical recycling, describing it in a report published this May as a key solution on the path toward \u201ccircularity in plastics.\u201d However, experts from outside the petrochemical industry say it doesn\u2019t work. Independent investigations have repeatedly found that most chemical recycling projects over the past several decades have failed or never got off the ground due to technical and economic hurdles. Those in operation today mostly turn plastics into fuel to be burned for energy or industrial uses, a process that is not circular under any traditional definition of the word. A worker stands in front of a chemical recycling plant owned by Dow Chemical south of Leipzig, Germany. Sebastian Willnow \/ picture alliance via Getty Images Not even mechanical recycling \u2014 the more conventional alternative to chemical recycling \u2014 seems capable of creating the \u201cplastic circular economy\u201d that many companies advertise. In the U.S., the plastics recycling rate is just 5 percent, and experts say it\u2019s unlikely to improve: There\u2019s simply too much plastic, in too many different varieties \u2014 most of which are too expensive or technologically difficult to turn back into new products. Meanwhile, plastics that do get recycled usually can\u2019t be turned back into the same items more than a couple of times; soon, they have to be \u201cdowncycled\u201d into something like a carpet or decking. Eventually, the plastic life cycle ends at a landfill or an incinerator, meaning more virgin plastic \u2014 made from fossil fuels \u2014 is required to make new products. What\u2019s more, recycled plastics may be contaminated with any number of 13,000 chemical additives, more than 70 percent of which are either known to have hazardous properties or have never been tested for toxicity. Plastics manufacturing, use, and disposal already exposes people to these chemicals \u2014 especially poor people and people of color \u2014 but mechanical recycling can keep them circulating through the economy for even longer. It can also shed thousands of tons of microplastics, tiny shards of plastic that poison the food chain and release greenhouse gases. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way to do plastics in a truly circular way,\u201d said Budris, with Just Zero. Others have called the plastics circular economy \u201can oxymoron at its core.\u201d Instead of trying to \u201cwedge\u201d plastics into the circular economy, Budris said there\u2019s an urgent need to reverse the plastic and petrochemical industries\u2019 expansion. These industries are planning to triple plastic production by 2060 \u2014 in part to offset declining demand for fossil fuels used for electricity, heat, and transportation. According to the International Energy Agency, plastics are expected to drive almost half of oil demand by the middle of the century. This issue has played prominently at negotiations for a global plastics treaty, where environmental groups have urged U.N. member states to \u201cturn off the tap\u201d and dramatically scale down plastic production. At the country level, they tend to support bills like the U.S.\u2019s Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2021, which never advanced out of committee but would have put a pause on new or expanded petrochemical facilities and banned several types of disposable plastic. Other countries\u2019 efforts, like the groundbreaking anti-waste and circular economy law that France passed in 2020, limit single-use plastic alongside complementary initiatives to reduce food waste and increase the repairability of phones, computers, and other electronics. U.S. Representative Steve Cohen speaks during a news conference promoting the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2020 in the U.S. Capitol on February 11, 2020, in Washington, D.C. Sarah Silbiger \/ Getty Images The need to reduce plastics wasn\u2019t completely lost at Circularity 23, either. At one panel, small business owners talked about their efforts to set up plastic-free reuse programs \u2014 one Vancouver, Canada-based company, for example, allows restaurants to serve takeout meals in stainless steel containers, which can later be returned at drop-off locations around the city. At another, Washington state representative Liz Berry spoke about her efforts to advance the WRAP Act, a far-reaching bill that would create a bottle deposit program, set mandatory quotas for reusable packaging, and hold companies financially responsible for dealing with the plastic they produce, among other things. The most powerful rebuke of the plastics circular economy, however, came during a keynote Q&A on the second day of the conference, when Joy and Jo Banner \u2014 sisters who lead The Descendants Project, a nonprofit based in a swath of Louisiana studded with so many petrochemical facilities that it\u2019s been dubbed \u201cCancer Alley\u201d \u2014 were asked how the world should address the plastic pollution crisis. Jo responded directly to the audience by describing how her community evacuates during a hurricane: People abruptly stop what they\u2019re doing, pile into their cars, and all drive in the same direction \u2014 away from the danger. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we need for plastics,\u201d she said: \u201ccontraflow. We all need to move away from it, we need to stop making excuses for it, we need to stop trying to make the economy off of it. Stop giving fossil fuels a lifeline.\u201d The audience applauded and whooped at her remarks \u2014 in fact, the Banner sisters got a standing ovation. Then, Circularity 23 attendees went to the next event, a collection of roundtable lunch discussions hosted by Dow, Eastman, Arkema, and other chemical companies and organizations that claim to be \u201cenabling a circular economy\u201d throughplasticsrecycling. Jon Smieja, the vice president of circularity for GreenBiz, the media and events organization that hosted Circularity 23, is not unaware of the controversy surrounding the circular economy. While he believes there is no one correct way to define circularity, he said he sees plenty of selectivity among corporations when it comes to describing their circular business practices. Many companies choose the part of circularity that \u201caligns most with what they feel like they can do,\u201d he said. Some promote a circular economy even as they participate in lobbying groups that advocate against circular policies like those contained in the WRAP Act. Defruyt, with EMF, agreed. EMF maintains there can be a place for plastics in a circular economy \u2014 the organization even has a \u201cnew plastics economy\u201d initiative for corporations and governments to sign onto, pledging to decrease virgin plastic use, incorporate more recycled content into their plastic packaging, and make all of their plastic recyclable, compostable, or reusable. But Defruyt said companies tend to ignore important principles like eliminating unnecessary materials use and allowing nature to regenerate. Companies ask, \u201cI want to put something plastic on the market, how do I make it circular?\u201d Defruyt said, instead of choosing materials and business models that are best suited to the circular economy. In some cases, businesses adopt one or more principles of circularity without actually being circular. One company promoting itself at the conference, for example, said it takes \u201cocean-bound plastics\u201d out of rivers in Southeast Asia and turns them into new mailing sleeves \u2014 a business model that might eke one more use out of discarded waste, but is predicated on, and potentially contributes to, a continuous supply of plastic litter. (A spokesperson from the company told Grist the mailers are \u201cby no means a perfectly circular product,\u201d but noted that they would remove waste from the environment in places where there is insufficient waste-management infrastructure.) Another company at the conference, r.Cup, provides transparent reusable cups for concerts, football games, and other large events. Though they\u2019re a clear improvement over disposable cups, r.Cup\u2019s reusable alternatives are made of polypropylene, a kind of rigid plastic that can only be used so many times before it reaches the end of its life. In general, polypropylene products are only turned into new items through downcycling, though they\u2019re more likely to be sent to landfills or incinerated. R.Cup\u2019s founder told Grist his company\u2019s cups are never sent to landfills and are only \u201cupcycled\u201d into opaque plastic cups, guitar picks, Frisbees, or other items. A Whole Foods in New York City dispenses eating utensils made from 100 percent recycled plastic. Lindsey Nicholson \/ UCG \/ Universal Images Group via Getty Images Smieja called these \u201cstop-the-bleeding stopgap\u201d solutions that can at least reduce plastics\u2019 impacts while, in the case of the plastic cups, proving the viability of reuse. More broadly, a spokesperson for GreenBiz defended plastics and plastics companies\u2019 role \u2014 both in the circular economy and at Circularity 23. \u201cFor better or for worse, plastics have a role in our current society,\u201d the company said. \u201cSome companies are, paradoxically, both part of the problem and key to implementing solutions at scale.\u201d Still, Smieja and others agreed that they might call for more specific language than just \u201ccircular.\u201d \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to use the word \u2018circular\u2019 with the consumer,\u201d Suzanne Shelton, CEO of a marketing communications agency called the Shelton Group and a speaker at Circularity 23, told Grist. Rather than claiming to be circular, she said, it\u2019s more helpful when brands describe how their products support a circular economy. If they\u2019re compostable, brands can just say that, she said. If their products are recyclable, then advertise that \u2014 but clarify how many times they can be recycled. That\u2019s similar to the approach of organizations like Just Zero and Beyond Plastics, which have abandoned circular terminology despite its deep entrenchment in business and policy spheres. Erica Cirino, communications manager for the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition, said there\u2019s a risk of any term being co-opted \u201cin the blink of an eye,\u201d but she and others prefer to use words like \u201creusable,\u201d \u201crefillable,\u201d and \u201czero-waste,\u201d which more precisely convey the concepts of material conservation and resource efficiency. King, with Greenpeace Canada, said she also tries to emphasize slowness, with reduced production and consumption throughout the economy. Not all corporations, governments, and intergovernmental organizations, however, are likely to make those distinctions voluntarily. If the circular economy is going to remain in the corporate and policymaking vernacular \u2014 as it likely will \u2014 then environmental groups say it should be qualified with terms like \u201ctoxics-free\u201d or \u201creuse-based.\u201d Ideally, they\u2019d like regulators to step in with clearer guardrails against greenwashing. \u201cI think the Federal Trade Commission should take it on,\u201d said Enck, from Beyond Plastics. The FTC, which protects U.S. consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices, is already working on revisions to its Green Guides, a set of guidelines around companies\u2019 sustainability advertising. The most anticipated revision is expected to offer a firmer definition of the term \u201crecyclable,\u201d but Enck said there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t also define circularity, potentially with different criteria for different industries. (The Green Guides updates were expected by the end of last year but have been delayed. It\u2019s unclear when they will be released.) \u201cThe first pillar needs to be conservation of resources and efficient use of resources,\u201d Enck said, calling for guidelines that prioritize the three R\u2019s of the zero-waste movement: \u201creduce, reuse, refill.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

That\u2019s where digital twins come into play\u2014they\u2019re like a supercharged tool that can tackle these aspects head-on. Around 50% of the time, digital twinning is primarily employed to enhance operational performance and manage quality control. Additionally, it is utilized for systems planning, which accounts for approximately 44% of its application. In Layman\u2019s language\u2026 A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. The object being studied\u2014for example, a wind turbine\u2014is outfitted with various sensors related to vital areas of functionality. These sensors produce data about different aspects of the physical object\u2019s performance, such as energy output, temperature, weather conditions, and more. This data is then relayed to a processing system and applied to the digital copy. Once informed with such data, the virtual model can be used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate possible improvements, all to generate valuable insights\u2014which can then be applied back to the original physical object. In recent years, the concept of digital twins has gained significant attention across various industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. In this article, we will delve into the benefits of using digital twins and explore how they are transforming industries worldwide. But first, let\u2019s understand the concept of digital twins. Also Read: WiMi Hologram Cloud is Developing A Digital Twin-based Human-Robot Collaboration System What are Digital Twins? Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects, processes, or systems that simulate their behavior and characteristics in real-time. They serve as digital counterparts, capturing data from sensors and devices embedded in their physical counterparts, allowing for monitoring, analysis, and optimization.
