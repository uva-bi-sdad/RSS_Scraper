However, to achieve long-lasting success and contribute positively to the planet and society, businesses must integrate sustainability from the very start of the innovation process. As renowned architect and systems theorist Buckminster Fuller once said, \"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" To address the pressing environmental challenges we face, businesses must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates sustainability into the innovation process from the start. By fostering an environment that encourages sustainable innovation, adopts a systems-thinking mindset and embeds sustainability principles into operations, organizations can create new models that not only ensure long-term resilience and responsible growth but also drive transformative change within industries. These strategies not only provide a roadmap for businesses to navigate the challenges of today but also lay a foundation for a future where sustainability and innovation are inseparable. By weaving sustainability into the fabric of their practices, businesses can redefine the status quo and pave the way for a greener future. Here are four ways you can start driving sustainable innovation at your company. 1. Embrace a systems-thinking mindset A systems-thinking mindset is a cornerstone for companies seeking to implement sustainable innovation. This mindset involves understanding complex systems as a set of interconnected and interdependent parts that influence each other and the overall system's behavior. By examining the entire lifecycle of a product or service \u2014 from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal \u2014 this holistic approach enables businesses to identify areas of potential improvement and increased sustainability. Recognizing the intricate interconnections among various elements within a system empowers organizations to better understand the implications of their actions and enables the development of innovative solutions that can reduce environmental impact and promote long-term resilience. The adoption of a systems-thinking mindset cultivates an organizational culture in which decision-makers are encouraged to look beyond immediate goals and outcomes. In doing so, they are better equipped to identify and address the root causes of environmental challenges, rather than merely focusing on superficial fixes or short-term gains. This approach fosters innovative thinking that can lead to more sustainable business models, ultimately reducing the ecological footprint of an organization and helping it achieve long-term success. By embracing a systems-thinking mindset, companies can propel themselves towards a future of truly sustainable growth and innovation, creating value for stakeholders and playing a pivotal role in protecting our planet for generations to come. 2. Sustainability should be part of the entire operational process Embedding sustainability principles within operational processes is an essential part of future-proofing businesses, as it ensures that environmental responsibility is woven into the fabric of the organization and drives innovative solutions. When businesses such as Interface and Patagonia embed sustainability into the core of their operations, they create a solid foundation that supports the seamless adoption of new sustainable innovations. By embedding these principles from the start, organizations can avoid costly and disruptive overhauls that may be required when attempting to retrofit existing operations. This proactive approach ensures that every aspect of the business aligns with a commitment to sustainability, facilitating the development and implementation of groundbreaking innovations that can have a lasting impact on both the environment and the bottom line. Integration of sustainability into the innovation process is not only a strategic business move, but it is also an urgent imperative in the context of our global environmental challenges. 3. A circular view is the key Adopting circular economy principles is yet another vital aspect of integrating sustainability into operations. By rethinking traditional linear models that rely on extraction, production and disposal, companies such as Interface and Patagonia have embraced a circular approach that focuses on minimizing waste, maximizing resource efficiency and extending the life of products and materials. By designing operations with circularity in mind, businesses have a new lens to view innovation and reduce their environmental impact, all while creating new opportunities for growth and competitive advantage. Ultimately, incorporating sustainability principles into every facet of a company's operations is a crucial strategy for fostering innovation and ensuring the long-term success of businesses in an increasingly environmentally conscious world. 4. Fostering an environment that encourages sustainable innovation Cultivating a climate of sustainable innovation is vital for businesses to thrive in an increasingly eco-conscious world, and it requires a multifaceted approach that involves government action, organizational culture and investor support. Government action plays a pivotal role in driving sustainable innovation by creating policies and regulations that incentivize businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices. By implementing progressive measures such as carbon pricing, tax incentives and funding for research and development of clean technologies, governments can help to level the playing field for sustainable enterprises and spur the adoption of innovative solutions that contribute to a greener future. In addition to government action, nurturing a culture of learning and adaptation within your own internal organization is essential. By placing sustainability at the forefront of company culture, businesses empower their workforce to prioritize environmental and social concerns alongside traditional profit and cost considerations. This cultural shift should empower employees to think critically about the environmental impact of their decisions, take risks and embrace new ideas that promote sustainability. Investor support is another crucial component. As more investors recognize the value of sustainable businesses and prioritize environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions, they help to create a financial ecosystem that supports the growth of companies dedicated to sustainable innovation. Integration of sustainability into the innovation process is not only a strategic business move, but it is also an urgent imperative in the context of our global environmental challenges. As we journey towards a future fraught with uncertainties, the guiding principles of sustainability can provide a compass, helping businesses navigate the evolving landscape and pioneer transformative change. By embedding sustainability at the heart of innovation, companies can build new models that make the old ones obsolete.","filter_flag":1}

This article investigates how food processing companies manage their side-streams by studying their sustainability reports, interviewing the companies, identifying external or internal side-stream management alternatives, and qualitatively analyzing the data. By learning more about how food processing companies prefer to manage their side-streams, it becomes easier to develop ideas for further refining of bio-residuals. One of the main results is that most of the companies prefer to use external actors for side-stream management and for processing them into high-value products, rather than developing and investing in the technology themselves. The few actors investing in side-stream management themselves have long-term strategies on how to become more sustainable and circular. This study also identifies biogas solutions through anaerobic digestion to have a special role in side-stream management due to its versatile and multifunctional nature. 1 Introduction The circular bio-economy is important as fossil products, to a larger extent, need to be replaced by bio-based ones, which means energy, nutrients, plastics, chemicals, and more need to be sourced from bio-based resources. Food production is one of the major contributors to environmental change and has a significant role in transitioning towards a more sustainable society. Recirculation of nutrients is becoming more prominent as the production of mineral fertilizers today is energy intensive and we approach phosphorus depletion (Sherwood, 2020). A focus on side-stream management within food industries can improve nutrient recovery and reduce environmental impact from the food processing company value chain. A large impact derives from agriculture and animal husbandry activities, but there is still environmental work to be done by food processing companies regarding side-streams. Sustainability strategies are important for food processing companies since customers and other stakeholders have high demands (Lozano, 2015). Commonly, packaging, transport, reducing waste, and technology improvements in industrial plants are common measures taken when food processing companies try to reduce their environmental impact. Side-streams always arise in food processing companies, and they can be managed in several ways. In this article, side-streams are defined as all flows\/streams not considered main products, thus including by-products, solid waste, and wastewater. The term side-stream is used as it gives the organic flow more value compared to calling it waste flow and is also used by practitioners (Adven, 2022; Mets\u00e4 Group, n.d.2022). Value is used in this article and means benefits related to economic, environmental, societal, or business-related impacts of the side-stream management of the companies. When food processing companies manage their side-streams, they can be guided by the food waste hierarchy, following the steps of prevention, re-use, recycle, recovery, and disposal (Papargyropoulou et al., 2014), with the recent addition of upcycled food products and specific recirculation alternatives (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1. Food waste hierarchy (based on the study by Moshtaghian et al., 2021). Valorization of food processing side-streams as animal feed is one of the most common practices in many settings (Otles et al., 2015). There is often potential for more high-value solutions, and side-stream management could provide an economic or environmental advantage (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2019). Legalization regarding food waste is improving, but there are still issues; for example, processed waste can be non-classified for human consumption, and thus, further development is impossible (Garske et al., 2020). The scientific literature regarding side-stream management in food industries focuses, to a large extent, on high-value products to be extracted from different food waste streams (c.f. Pfaltzgraff et al., 2013; Ravelli and Samor\u00ec, 2021), or a waste biorefinery approach (c.f. Alibardi et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2018; Dahiya et al., 2018), or the life-cycle impact of different treatment methods (c.f. Fei et al., 2022; Kobayashi et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2015). Yet, more research is needed regarding the role side-streams have in food processing companies\u2019 sustainability strategy, business models, and if side-streams should acquire more attention than before. There are identified research gaps by Klitkou et al. (2019) and Salvador et al. (2021) regarding lack of business models for valorization of side-streams and the circular bio-economy in general. Therefore, this paper investigates if, and how, side-stream management is integrated into sustainability strategies among food processing companies and how they organize their management and use of side-streams. Sustainability strategies reflect long-term ideas for how the food processing company can reduce its environmental impact. The institutions and the food processing companies can work together to develop commercially viable processes for side-stream management according to Khedkar and Singh (2018). When it comes to the management literature, Magnusson et al. (2019) developed a framework for recovery of side-streams in manufacturing firms, and they identified four main alternatives for recovery and use of side-streams based on internal or external activities. Their article is like a bridge between this one and the field of industrial ecology and business strategy. There is more to learn from food processing industries regarding their perspective on side-streams and circularity and, especially, the side-streams seen as lower valued. Using side-streams as animal feed or for biogas solutions can mitigate global warming and recover energy and fertilizer (Hagman et al., 2020), which contributes to the development of more environmentally sustainable handling of different food side-streams and keeps valuable resources in a circular system (Scherhaufer et al., 2020). Biogas solutions include anaerobic digestion of organic streams, where biogas is produced and can be used as energy either directly, through a generator, or upgraded to fuel; in addition, a nutrient and fiber-rich digestate is produced in biogas plants, which can be used as biofertilizer (Wellinger et al., 2013), as biochar, or dried as an incineration fuel. Their other advantage is that they involve the return of nutrients to food-producing fields. There is an important role for biogas solutions to play in the transition into more bio-based synergies between industries (Medkova et al., 2019; Vanham\u00e4ki et al., 2020), not only as a bio-refining concept but also as a hub for surrounding industries (Lyb\u00e6k and Kj\u00e6r, 2021) and for improved nutrient recovery from digested streams (Vaneeckhaute et al., 2017). Biogas solutions are multifunctional (Lindfors et al., 2020) and versatile (Mountraki et al., 2016). This means they can have several roles in a bio-based cluster, such as waste management, wastewater management, energy provision, or fertilizer production. Biogas solutions can handle a range of diverse types of substrates and are useful even when the quality of the residuals is not high enough for feed or when materials are bulky and expensive to transport (Pereira et al., 2013). To use biogas solutions at the end of a cascading sequence, a company may improve the value of its raw material while generating products useful for its suppliers and energy for its production facility (Fagerstr\u00f6m et al., 2018). This article aims to investigate how food processing companies manage and consider their side-streams with a special focus on biogas solutions as a management alternative. This topic will be studied in the light of sustainable strategies of the companies. The structure of the article is as follows: Section 2 provides a description of methods used; Section 3 provides the results and analysis of how the side-stream management is organized, connected to strategy, and motivated; and Section 4 provides a discussion including circularity of side-stream management and the role of biogas solutions. 2 Methods This article is based on a qualitative research approach (Bryman, 2016, chap. 17). Fifteen identified study objects from the Swedish food processing industry were asked to participate in this study, and ten of these were identified as the largest (based on turnover), according to largestcompanies.se January 2021 and, thus, covering a large part of the Swedish food market. In Sweden, the presence of large and centralized private or cooperative food processing actors is common. The remaining five were chosen as they had established biogas solutions as a side-stream management; three of these were identified by Google search using the keywords (\u201cfood processing company\u201d +biogas + Sweden), and two were known from previous studies by the author. The study objects are chosen to assure that biogas solutions could be focused upon in the cases. 2.1 Data collection A desktop study was performed, focusing on the study objects\u2019 websites and sustainability reports. In Figure 2, the method is illustrated. FIGURE 2 FIGURE 2. Method description regarding study objects chosen, desktop review performed, and focus areas for interviews. Following the desktop study, interviews were conducted during 2021. Within the companies, the aim was to contact sustainability managers who would have a good perspective of the company\u2019s organization and sustainability ambition together with the business strategies, while still having some knowledge of what happens to the side-streams. In some cases, if the sustainability manager could not be reached, then perspectives of employees working with side-streams were then used together with the information from the sustainability reports. Among the 15 contacted companies, 12 chose to respond to an interview, and the results are based on these 12 companies\u2019 responses and background information. The three non-participating companies belonged to sectors included among the other companies. The interviews were semi-structured, and after the respondents (Table 1) had introduced themselves with background and work descriptions, attention was on five focus areas: management alternatives for side-streams, biogas solutions, factors for choosing side-stream management, business strategy and collaboration, and sustainability work and organization. TABLE 1 TABLE 1. Side-streams and side-stream management for all interviewed cases are presented. In addition, information about the respondents is also included. The first results show the type of side-streams (defined by the companies themselves) and what they are used for. These results are followed by how the actors consider their side-stream management. 2.2 Data analysis The first part of the analysis, reported in Section 3.2, uses the informant\u2019s description of their business and collaboration strategies and the sustainability reports to analyze the company\u2019s sustainability ambitions. It looks at the company\u2019s long-term visions, plans for circularity, and role of the environmental issues. The second part of the analysis is based on the side-stream options found at the companies, and a framework given by Magnusson et al. (2019) is applied. The framework originates from manufacturing firms and how they manage their recovered resources. They perform recovery either internally or by external actors, and the product can then be used internally or sold externally. In this paper, it is reorganized according to Figure 3. The side-stream management mapped through the interviews is categorized into this framework, and the result shows the connection between a company\u2019s side-stream management and way of including external actors. FIGURE 3 FIGURE 3. Analysis method restructured from the work of Magnusson et al. (2019). Another analysis of the data identifies a hierarchy among the side-stream management alternatives based on responses from several actors who ranked side-stream management options in the interviews. Because of biogas solutions\u2019 nutrient recovery and potential for circularity within the value chain, there are specific discussions regarding this as a side-stream management option and the connections to a company\u2019s sustainability strategy. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Descriptions of the side-stream management among the studied cases The companies participating in this study represent several types of food processing companies. In Table 1, the specific side-streams and types of management alternatives are listed. There is a range of various kinds of side-streams connected to dairies, slaughterhouses, vegetable processing, and fats, which are often used as food components, feed, or biogas solutions. Focus has been on the flows, which the companies themselves see as side-streams; for example, slaughterhouses have several products that could be considered side-streams but are commonly used as products and are, therefore, not included. The results are based on activities in Sweden. Actors with activities in other countries mention that the circularity has not been prioritized, partly because landfilling is a cheap alternative, but food donations are also more common in these countries. 3.2 Results and analysis of sustainability and business strategies within the companies The business strategy is to produce food and generate returns for shareholders. Side-streams are not prioritized among most food processing companies. Their sustainability strategies focus on reducing CO 2 emissions by using fossil-free fuels and energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and smarter packaging. The main driver for this is the increased pressure from consumers and stakeholders. The studied companies have worked for a few years on improving their own climate emissions, and, recently, several of them have set up science-based targets, which are in line with the Paris 2015 agreement (Science Based Targets, 2022). They address the full value chain\u2019s sustainability impact, and the results show that approximately 90% of the value chain\u2019s impact is in the food-producing stage according to several respondents. The studied companies identify that collaboration with upstream partners or reducing food losses are other keys to improve the value chain\u2019s sustainability. Other aspects discussed in company groups with activities outside Sweden are water quality and security. Upcycling side-streams into food products is also becoming more interesting; because some of the actors in this category have a wider range of products, the development potential for new food from side-streams is easier. Secondary products, which earlier could be sold at the local industrial plant, can now be sold as specific products, marketed to improve resource efficiency, on the regular market. The author can identify two ambition levels regarding the companies\u2019 sustainability strategies, based on information from interviews and sustainability reports. Some actors work with sustainability because customer demand has increased, but their main aim is to generate more money for their shareholders. Others invest large amounts of money in improving circularity and product development, as they see a need to work with this question for the environment\u2019s sake, although economic results are still important. When the companies in the first category discuss sustainability strategies for side-streams, economical, climate-related, high-value, and organizational aspects are in focus. The economical aspect is prioritized for these companies, and sustainable action is becoming more justified with more economic reasoning than a decade ago. Most actors are reactive to the stakeholders and changes in society demanding sustainable products and improved animal welfare. One company has not had high stakeholder and customer demands and noticed that its sustainability work lagged behind. Most of the companies find sustainability important and high on their agenda, yet they connect reduced climate impact with the possibility to reduce costs or market themselves. Circularity is not always an integrated strategy for these companies, but they are moving in that direction. The organization for sustainability in these companies differs; some have a group of people, others have sustainability managers who are putting the responsibility on plant managers, and others try to integrate sustainability in everyday work. When the companies in the second category talk about strategies for side-streams, they work proactively to ensure sustainable operation in the future. Sustainable investments can be more expensive, as it becomes a competitive advantage. One company uses two investment budgets, one for long-term projects with a sustainability focus allowing a pay-off of 10\u201315 years and a regular one. Another company, family-owned, allows longer pay-off times compared to regular projects with only 3\u20135 years pay-off. Several actors in this category point out that customers and partners need to accept sustainable products cost more because they require higher investments and work intensity. The companies are working with this aim to integrate sustainability into the whole company and educate their employees on how to think and act. They monitor their side-streams to be able to identify further valorization alternatives for the streams. They mention that stubbornness is important to see change, as sustainability actions can be slow to get through. Most of these companies market their solutions very little; they are mentioned on websites and in sustainability reports, but some just see it as a natural way to work and have not considered it a unique selling point. 3.3 Analysis of side-stream management among food processing companies The prioritization among interviewed actors is to reduce side-streams and ensure that fewer side-streams are generated. After that, it is preferred to either partner with external companies or invest in technology themselves regarding high-value components, like xylitol, or new food products. New food products could include sales of secondary products or side-streams refined into new products. The will to invest in innovative technology for side-streams is low, and most actors prefer if external actors want to buy the side-streams for further valorization; this is often true for lower-valued solutions. An example was a company with beetroot juice, which could be further refined to coloring additives, but the food processing company did not want the investment and no external actor was found. The choice of management for their side-streams can depend on the communication value of the solution. High-value components or new food products can be good to communicate or as feed, and biogas solutions can be communicated as local and circular options. There are other reasons why an option is chosen; one company mentioned that a side-stream they wanted to use as feed required quality analysis to be approved, and as soon as it was approved, they were not eager to change management alternatives as they had paid for the tests to use it as feed. The most important factor for the food processing companies is that side-streams do not end up in incinerators or landfills. The management alternative can come with a risk as well. The demand for slaughter wastes as feed for the fur industry disappeared overnight when Denmark killed all their ferrets during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a side-stream market in decline, so options like salmon feed and biogas production had been identified, but it was problematic to change with such short notice. It is common for food processing companies to be aware of and follow the food waste hierarchy. Figure 4 shows how food processing companies in general have chosen to recover their side-streams and how they use the recovered product. A company can appear in several squares, as they may have several side-streams and management alternatives. FIGURE 4 FIGURE 4. This figure illustrates how the studied companies manage their side-streams in relation to external or internal actors for the recovery of side-streams and use of recovered products. Open solutions are applied in all case companies on one or several side-streams. This option is driven by economic benefits, focusing on core business and a smooth solution. The food processing companies claim that those best suited to valorization should ensure it. Sustainability strategies have a role in open cases where higher valorization by an external actor is preferred. Business-related advantages with open solutions are that uncertainties are put to the external actors, as they make the necessary investments and manage the sales and marketing, and the food processing company can focus on ensuring that the operation runs smoothly with their external partners and that they stay in business (Magnusson et al., 2019). For food processing companies with large (often liquid) flows, alternatives which can manage the full volume are preferred to have long-term contracts with, such as biogas solutions. The open strategy depends on potential products produced from the side-stream, how much additional processing is needed, and how long transportation is required to valorize the side-stream. In open systems, biogas solutions are useful in local settings with short transportation or distribution through pipes. Depending on the distance, the income from biogas solutions is low for the food processing company; instead, values from regional development, reduced transportation, nutrient recirculation, and sustainability strategies are arguments for biogas solutions in open systems. The food processing company can sign long-term contracts with one side-stream actor who manages the side-streams in different parts of the country, and they can then get invoices and data directly from that company, which facilitates the side-stream management that can require significant paperwork for the food processing company due to reporting demands. The side-streams are monitored monthly and followed up on to see where further improvements are possible. Outsourcing among all the studied cases includes a biogas component. There is an internal energy demand in the production plant which can be replaced by biogas, but they do not have the capacity to produce the biogas themselves, so they deliver side-streams for biogas production and buy the produced gas. This seems common when there is a local biogas plant, and the food processing company has goals to replace fossil fuels and reduce CO 2 emissions. It requires long-term agreements to reduce uncertainty regarding deliveries in these setups as the food processing company is extending its value chain (Magnusson et al., 2019). The food processing industry\u2019s side-stream volumes may be too small to invest in a biogas production facility itself, and so prefer to buy gas from a co-digestion plant. The business value lies in improving sustainability performance by using biogas instead of fossil fuels. Diversification is chosen by actors who have side-streams through which they recover or upgrade to food products in four cases and oleochemical products in the fifth. In those cases, the upgraded product lies within their business strategy: \u201cto produce high-value food products or fatty products.\u201d They are not moving outside their business idea by refining these products. These companies see a value in their side-streams and integrate them into the business strategy because they become products that are easy to incorporate into the overall business strategy. The sustainability aspect of this alternative is important, as food is a prioritized product for a food processing company, and it reduces the need for other food products. Drivers for these solutions are either economical or part of the sustainability strategy. One company invested in technology to extract a high-value sweetener component, as the economic performance would improve and because the circular economy discourse in society inspired them to develop new products. By diversifying and creating new products from side-streams, new markets may open to the food processing company, but it comes with additional costs for technology, marketing, and potentially sales (Magnusson et al., 2019). Closed arrangements are applied by companies recovering their own side-streams and are often used for internal energy purposes. These solutions are common in wastewater streams or when flows of by-products are large, and the produced gas has enough value to replace external energy. In four cases, biogas solutions are used as a closed system, and the final alternative is bio-oil for energy. These companies have made the investment to become more self-sufficient in energy. The companies could save money by producing energy from internal waste or wastewater flows and cost reduction is a motive for change (c.f. Van Beers et al., 2007). It was important for some of the actors to produce their own energy and reduce their climate impact. Two of the companies find the circularity of nutrients important, as they either have their own farm to fertilize or collaborate with farmers. Closed systems are useful if the company has internal needs for the recovered products and is willing to invest in technology for recovery (Magnusson et al., 2019). 3.4 Hierarchy of side-stream management Improving resource efficiency implies that the food industries need to prioritize how to manage their side-streams. Based on the responses from the case studies, a hierarchy within food side-streams can be constructed (Figure 5), which is more specific in the re-use, recycle, and recovery steps in the food waste hierarchy compared to earlier examples (Papargyropoulou et al., 2014; Moshtaghian et al., 2021). It is illustrated as a staircase rather than a pyramid since volumes going into different treatments can vary, and large volumes of low-quality side-streams can be diverted to steps further down the hierarchy. Another difference is that anaerobic digestion is equal to feed, which in other hierarchies is often ranked lower (Papargyropoulou et al., 2014; Moshtaghian et al., 2021). Still, higher-value products should be prioritized, and biogas solutions can often manage side-streams originating from these upcycled products. FIGURE 5 FIGURE 5. Hierarchy among side-stream management alternatives ranging from high-value chemicals to food, bioenergy, and feed. To a large degree, the staircase hierarchy focuses on economic factors; higher-ranked options, for example, pay better. The options that are the hardest to separate among the respondents in this stair-based hierarchy are the feed and biogas alternatives (circled in Figure 3), which are often the main competitors for lower-quality residuals that are not fit for human consumption. Which one of these is chosen is related to the availability of the local actors. Biogas solutions have the advantage of handling larger volumes than most feed customers do. Biogas solutions are chosen instead of feed if the company desires to produce its own energy or when agricultural actors are already collaborating with the food processing company, and the biofertilizer is valuable to them; otherwise, feed is the chosen option. 4 Discussion 4.1 Implementation of sustainable side-stream management According to the interviews, side-streams did not have a prominent role in business or sustainability strategies among the food companies a decade ago, but with the growing discourse about circular economy, the interest increased, which was also put forward by K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen and Lintukangas (2022). The companies find it attractive to be a part of a circular system instead of a linear one, both from a financial and market perspective. The side-stream management can be inspired by other actors in the same sector, and the Swedish Food Federation is working more actively with improving sustainability among their members (Swedish Food Federation, 2019). One case study, which has been in action for generations, has ambitious sustainability plans to assure the company will survive for many more generations. Ferreira et al. (2021) also suggested that family businesses have more long-term perspectives compared to competitors in their area, indicating higher sustainability ambitions than others. Klein et al. (2022) studied agri-food companies handling potatoes and concluded that the industry needs to reform their business model to become more sustainable and see side-streams as a value rather than a waste, but this transformation is affected by both internal and external factors, and they also identified external partnerships as important in the development. Klein et al. (2022) put the finger on what this article will show: business models need to be thought through to improve sustainability in these value chains and external partners are important to assure a sustainable use of side-streams. Research focusing on business models regarding side-streams in the agri-food sector is not common, but this article can strengthen the results of Klein et al. (2022), as multiple cases show comparable results. Actors preferring internal recovery of their side-stream often do so when new food products can be produced out of a side-stream. Magnusson et al. (2019) showed that valorizing side-streams internally can be tempting but hard, as it requires investments and comes with a risk. Deciding what kind of products should be produced from the side-stream can be hard; in scientific literature, there are a large number of articles focusing on bioenergy recovery rather than higher-valued physical products according to Jones et al. (2022). The organization around the side-stream management, therefore, needs to be assessed, and Lyb\u00e6k and Kj\u00e6r (2021) identified biogas solutions to be an attractive hub for circularity in a region rather than a component at biorefineries to improve circularity. Lyb\u00e6k and Kj\u00e6r (2021) demonstrated that agricultural residuals can be managed in a more circular way by extracting high-value products like wax and furfural substrates and that a biogas plant would function as a hub among the refining actors. These actors are typically small but can contribute with simple biorefinery modules in a region. The idea is to combine product development from side-streams but also recovery energy. Business models for circular economy may inspire food processing companies on how to manage their side-streams. Similar to the work of Lyb\u00e6k and Kj\u00e6r (2021), an article by Tsvetkova and Gustafsson (2012) points out the modular approach, where actors surrounding biofuel production plants, in their case, support the main actor with distinct functions, creating a bio-based local system that is reliable and persistent. The circular approach is driven by the close collaboration within the value chain, and biogas solutions are useful when the side-streams\u2019 quality is low, and nutrients can be recovered locally according to the work of Feiz et al. (2021). Biomass production, nutrient flows, and energy use are interlinked, and biogas solutions could provide options for improving nutrient recycling as well as allowing for bioenergy production, which does not compete with food production (Koppelm\u00e4ki et al., 2021). Partnerships, value creation, and circularity play important roles when choosing internal recovery of side-streams among the studied cases. Partners that manage side-streams are often found locally, and several actors highlight the local circularity as important for their choice. This is in line with the work of Feiz et al. (2021) who identified local development to have a role in bio-based clusters with biogas solutions. While some see their side-stream partners as part of the business strategy, others focus on the economic value where the partners help in valorizing side-streams and food industry companies can focus on their core business. High-value components are investigated to improve circularity and income, and several actors in this study have started to look at biochar from their carbon-rich side-stream. Biochar is a way of improving carbon storage in soils (Lehmann et al., 2011). The implications of these results show how a more resource efficient management of side-streams will be developed and what arguments are brought forward for different alternatives among practitioners. It can impact what strategies food processing companies will have when they need to find higher-valued uses of their side-streams. The results are useful in places where large food processing companies are common, where similar business strategies are applied, and where the management of bio-based waste is regulated in some way. 4.2 Role of biogas solutions Food processing companies need to work with the full value chain to ensure sustainable practices; this includes cascading and upcycling between products and energy solutions. Biogas can be a suitable finish in a resource-efficient bio-economy (Hagman et al., 2018). Lyng et al. (2018) observed that biogas solutions are well integrated in a value chain and improve the sustainability performance of the system. In one of the cases studied in this article, a food processing company has close collaboration with the delivering farms; it sees value in delivering biofertilizer back to these farmers, which will reduce the overall environmental impact when replacing mineral fertilizers or reduce costs compared to other organic approved fertilizers. Even if side-streams should be avoided and high-value products prioritized according to Lyb\u00e6k and Kj\u00e6r (2021), the role of biogas solutions is to connect the farmers producing the food with the processing companies refining the products, creating a truly circular system thanks to the nutrient recovery (Carey et al., 2016; Vaneeckhaute et al., 2017). This study shows that a beneficial solution can be used to combine manure-based biogas plants at farms with input from low-value side-streams from the food processing companies, as short transportation distances were preferred among the respondents. The results from Feiz et al. (2021) showed that nutrient recovery improved and transportation was reduced when applying biogas solutions compared to other alternatives, which may be of importance when food industries choose the management option. Other options for biogas solutions are when no higher-valued solutions can be identified, or the high-value extraction results in low-value side-streams, or if alternatives are too costly to perform due to transportation, or if circularity is important and the nutrient recovery is prioritized. Fagerstr\u00f6m et al. (2018) suggested that a company may improve the value of its raw material while generating products useful for its suppliers and energy for its production facility through biogas solutions. That is in line with the results from the respondents in this article as well but the diversity of solutions that can potentially be realized from a biogas solution is not considered among most of the companies. Instead, few companies bring up the nutrient and fiber aspect when recovering side-streams. The nutrient question may not be so high on their agenda as climate impact and CO 2 emissions are the priority among most companies and perhaps the nutrient issue is not well known. It is worth noting that composting, a nutrient recovery option, was not mentioned as an alternative among any food processing company in the study. The nutrient issue has become more pressing lately and will most likely be considered more in the future. The nutrient aspect of sustainable side-stream management in food processing companies should be further explored. Biogas solutions have long been viewed as an energy recovery step that is often far down in the food waste hierarchies by Moshtaghian et al. (2021) and Papargyropoulou et al. (2014). This article shows that biogas solutions have a natural role in the food processing company\u2019s side-stream management because of the additional possibility to recover nutrients and its versatile nature. When food waste cannot be avoided, Stone et al. (2019) identified further valorization to increase a company\u2019s resilience. With these results, the biogas sector can better understand what customers are looking for when comparing, for example, feed options and biogas options. Transportation distance, payment, and connection to farmers in need of digestate are reasons to choose biogas solutions over feed options. This can help them in choosing market strategies and their customer relations. 5 Conclusion This article focuses on the strategic role of side-stream management in food processing industries. The interviewed Swedish companies are good at valorizing their side-streams, but there is potential to create more value. If external actors are available, food processing companies prefer external management rather than investing in innovative technology themselves, developing into a biorefinery. With this knowledge, local networks to valorize food processing side-streams can be developed. The results from this article add to the existing literature an insight that side-stream management can be organized in several ways and that food processing companies often prefer external actors to manage their side-streams, which is in line with earlier research. However, more information on the characteristics of partnerships and interactions is needed to make more conclusive statements. Companies with a circular approach in their sustainability strategy regarding their side-stream management seem to be more active in identifying new alternatives and accepting long-term investments. Embracing the side-stream management has the potential to improve sustainability, resource efficiency, and the value for the company. When high-value products and new food products are extracted from the side-streams, the remaining fraction is often suited for a biogas solution to recover its energy and nutrients. If food processing companies work more within their own value chain, biogas solutions can improve sustainability performance for the agricultural actors in the value chain by using digestate as fertilizer to a higher degree. In future studies, there can be a focus on how these systems will become more resource efficient either through developing an internal biorefinery processer or using external actors to continue processing the materials, how different alternatives can be facilitated, and what factors are relevant for either method to develop (Budzianowski, 2017; Venkata Mohan et al., 2019).

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: The failure of a component of an electric bike may result in a total loss. In a study, researchers at Fraunhofer IPA have demonstrated that manufacturing spare parts using additive manufacturing is worthwhile. Credit: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft An increasing number of people are riding electric bikes. Compared to cars, electric bikes are cheaper, more environmentally friendly, healthier for every-one and free up space in urban areas. The drawback is that there are often no spare parts for defective components such as motors or batteries, meaning they have to be completely replaced with expensive new components. A team of researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA demonstrated in a study with its partners that electric bike motors can be remanufactured in keeping with the concept of a modern circular economy. The researchers at Fraunhofer IPA will provide insight into the remanufacturing of electric bike components in the RemanLab, a new learning environment for remanufacturing. The popularity of electric bikes continues to grow\u2014according to the German Bicycle Industry Association (ZIV), electric bikes accounted for 48 percent of sales across the entire bicycle market in 2022\u2014and this figure is set to increase in future. The choice of models is also becoming more diverse. Alongside well-known brands, small manufacturers, too, are bringing new products to the market. However, especially in the case of batteries and motors, it is often technically and economically unfeasible to be repaired in the workshop. Thus, the failure of a component of an electric bike may result in a total loss. Why not industrially remanufacture the used electric bike motors? Researchers at Fraunhofer IPA asked themselves that very question as part of the AddRE-Mo project. Together with partners from cirp GmbH, Electric Bike Solutions GmbH, the sponsoring association Cluster of Environmental Technologies Bavaria e. V. and the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, they explored the technical feasibility of remanufacturing electric bike motors. This involved taking a close look at the entire remanufacturing process chain\u2014from non-destructive disassembly to cleaning, testing, reconditioning and finally reassembly\u2014and analyzing its ecological and economic potential. What's more, the researchers wanted to test the use of additive manufacturing processes and suitable combinations of processes and materials to produce long-lasting and reliable spare parts. From disassembly to reassembly \"If the motor or battery fails, it's usually the case that the entire component is replaced, even though it may only be one gear that's faulty. It is rarely worthwhile for electric bike workshops to repair a motor or battery, and manufacturers also have a vested interest in replacing old motors, which are the biggest cost drivers in electric bikes, with new ones,\" says Jan Koller, project manager and group leader at Fraunhofer IPA, describing the dilemma. \"Our goal was to implement a value retention network by establishing an industrial remanufacturing process where a large number of motors (between 50 and 100) go through the process.\" The first step for Koller and his team was to examine electric bike motors from established manufacturers to determine their probability of failure. Then they investigated whether and under what conditions spare parts with a high wear rate, such as gears and torque supports, could be additively manufactured. The scientists gathered the necessary data for additive manufacturing either through 3D modeling or 3D digitization, depending on the geometry of the components. They then selected materials and additive processes. Finally, together with the companies cirp and Electric Bike Solutions, Fraunhofer IPA manufactured the components and tested their service life, noise emission and temperature resistance on purpose-developed test benches and under real loads. A total of over 120 components were produced from 20 different materials using 3D printers. High-speed sintering, a special process for manufacturing or modifying materials, proved particularly promising when used in combination with the plastic polyamide 12 (PA12). The project results are summarized in the study \"Additive Refabrikation in der Elektrofahrradbranche\" (Additive remanufacturing in the electric bike industry), which is available for download free of charge. The project partners were able to demonstrate technical feasibility and durability through reassembly and testing under real operating conditions. The research results showed that individual components such as gear wheels can be manufactured additively and used sustainably. \"At the end of the process chain, remanufacturing delivers a bike motor that is on par with a newly manufactured motor in terms of quality, and also comes with the same guarantee,\" Koller explains. Resource efficiency and sustainability through additive remanufacturing Another important factor was the ecological evaluation of the remanufacturing process relative to brand new production. \"Additive manufacturing has the potential to improve circularity in the electric bike industry and reduce resource wastage. A kilogram CO 2 equivalent saving of 90 percent can be achieved in comparison with brand new production,\" says the industrial engineer. The economic savings potential, on the other hand, depends on the number of units and is usually around 30 to 40 percent for comparable components as compared to buying a new electric motor.\" Consequently, remanufacturing also harbors great potential for manufacturers of electric motors. RemanLab learning environment to open its doors in Bayreuth To perpetuate the achievements of this project, the process chain for remanufacturing electric bike motors will be implemented and demonstrated in the new RemanLab learning environment for remanufacturing at Fraunhofer IPA in Bayreuth. The RemanLab will open on May 23, 2023. In this realistic learning environment, which features all the necessary test benches, companies will gain an insight into the future of sustainable production. Electric bike motors will be used to impart knowledge about the complexity of the remanufacturing process, from entrance diagnosis to disassembly, cleaning, testing, reconditioning, reassembly and final inspection, with the aid of demonstrators such as an augmented reality application for disassembly. \"Up to this point, remanufacturing has been characterized by cost- and labor-intensive processes. In the RemanLab, we will demonstrate how digital technologies and automation can revolutionize remanufacturing not only of electric motors, but also of small electrical appliances and other products in the future,\" says Koller.","filter_flag":1}

Industry Excellence: Ideal for food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, and consumer goods. Stretch Wrapping and Strapping: When to Choose One or Both? Discovering the most effective packaging method can be a challenge. However, stretch wrapping and strapping each have distinct advantages and work well in specific scenarios and for particular industries. For some applications though, using both stretch wrapping and strapping provide maximum protection and stability during transport and storage. The Benefits of Stretch Wrapping Stretch wrapping is a popular method of securing and protecting palletized products during transport and storage. Some of the advantages of stretch wrap systems include: Enhanced Protection: Stretch film protects against dust, moisture, and debris, ensuring product safety. Load Stability: The stretch film's elastic properties help maintain load stability during transportation. Adaptability: Stretch wrappers can accommodate a variety of load sizes, shapes, and weights. Industry Benefits: Stretch wrapping suits various sectors, including food and beverage, logistics, paper, and pharmaceuticals. The Advantages of Strapping Strapping is ideal for heavy, rigid, or irregularly shaped products requiring extra support and securement during transportation and while in storage. Key benefits include: High Tensile Strength: Strapping materials offer strong, tight bonds that withstand significant force. Mosca's SoniXs ultrasonic welding allows the use of PP or PET strapping for better cost options and improving Co2 footprint and sustainability. Load Security: Strapping systems ensure heavy or unstable loads remain secure during transit and while in storage. Minimal Damage Risk: Strapping reduces the chance of package damage, as it doesn't apply direct pressure to the products. Mosca's direct drive technology minimizes product impact when strapping. Resource Efficiency: Strapping often uses less material than stretch wrapping, reducing packaging waste and lowering costs. Industry Benefits: Strapping works well in industries where secure containment of bulky or heavy items is crucial. When To Use Both for Maximum Protection and Stability In some scenarios, combining stretch wrapping and strapping provides palletized products with ultimate protection and stability. Here are five reasons why: Maximized Security: Combining stretch wrap and strapping ensures the highest level of security, minimizing the risk of product damage, tampering or loss during transit.

As the demand for batteries increases in various sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and consumer electronics, the need for responsible management of used batteries becomes paramount. Battery recycling not only helps to reduce the environmental impact of battery production but also contributes to resource conservation, the reduction of hazardous waste, and the promotion of a circular economy. Environmental Benefits of Battery Recycling: Resource Conservation: Batteries contain valuable metals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and lead, among others. Recycling allows for the recovery and reuse of these materials, reducing the need for new resource extraction. By recycling batteries, we can conserve scarce resources and alleviate the environmental impact associated with mining and processing raw materials. Waste Reduction: Batteries, if not properly managed, can pose environmental hazards due to the presence of toxic and hazardous materials. Recycling batteries prevents them from ending up in landfills, where they can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water. Additionally, recycling helps reduce the overall volume of waste generated by the battery industry, contributing to a more sustainable waste management system. Energy and Emissions Reduction: Recycling batteries consumes less energy compared to the extraction and refining of raw materials. It also reduces the carbon emissions associated with mining and processing activities. By diverting used batteries from traditional disposal methods, recycling minimizes the environmental footprint of battery production and supports the goals of carbon reduction and energy conservation. Economic and Social Benefits of Battery Recycling: Resource Recovery and Economic Value: The recycling process enables the recovery of valuable metals and materials from used batteries. These recovered materials can be reintroduced into the manufacturing process, reducing the dependence on primary raw materials. Moreover, the recycling industry creates jobs and economic opportunities, contributing to local economies and supporting sustainable development. Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management: Proper management of used batteries through recycling ensures compliance with environmental regulations and reduces the potential risks associated with improper disposal. Recycling facilities employ technologies and processes that minimize the release of harmful substances, protecting the environment and human health. Closed-Loop Systems and Circular Economy: Battery recycling promotes the concept of a circular economy, where products and materials are recycled, reused, or repurposed to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency. By incorporating recycled materials into battery production, manufacturers can reduce their reliance on virgin resources and create closed-loop systems that minimize environmental impact. Challenges and Considerations in Battery Recycling: Despite its many benefits, battery recycling faces several challenges that need to be addressed: Collection Infrastructure: Establishing an efficient and widespread collection infrastructure for used batteries is essential. It requires collaboration among stakeholders, including manufacturers, governments, retailers, and consumers, to ensure the proper collection and transportation of batteries to recycling facilities. Technology Development: Continuous research and development are needed to improve recycling technologies and processes. Advancements in battery design, labeling, and separation techniques can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling operations. Safety and Environmental Concerns: Battery recycling facilities must adhere to strict safety standards to protect workers, communities, and the environment from potential hazards associated with the handling and processing of batteries. Proper treatment and disposal of by-products and waste streams are crucial to minimizing any adverse impacts. Consumer Awareness and Participation: Educating consumers about the importance of battery recycling and providing convenient collection points can increase participation rates. Public awareness campaigns and incentives can encourage responsible disposal and recycling practices. Government Support and Policies: Government support and policies play a vital role in promoting battery recycling and sustainable manufacturing practices. Key measures include: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): EPR policies shift the responsibility for managing and recycling batteries from consumers to manufacturers. This encourages manufacturers to design batteries with recycling in mind and invest in collection and recycling infrastructure. Financial Incentives: Governments can provide financial incentives such as tax breaks or grants to support the establishment and operation of battery recycling facilities. These incentives can attract investment and foster the growth of a robust recycling industry. Regulations and Standards: Implementing regulations and standards for the recycling and treatment of batteries ensure compliance and consistency in recycling practices. These regulations can include requirements for the safe handling, transportation, and processing of batteries. Research and Development Funding: Governments can allocate funds to support research and development efforts aimed at improving battery recycling technologies, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs. Conclusion: Battery recycling is a critical component of sustainable manufacturing practices. It offers significant environmental, economic, and social benefits by conserving resources, reducing waste, minimizing environmental impact, and supporting the transition to a circular economy. Collaboration among manufacturers, governments, and consumers is essential to establish effective collection systems, develop innovative recycling technologies, and raise awareness about the importance of responsible battery disposal. By embracing battery recycling, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.","filter_flag":1}
