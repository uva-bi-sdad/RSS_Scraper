Look at stores shelves and you will see myriad brands with new products coming out all the time \u2014 new shades\/colors, new packaging, combo products, one-ingredient items, and more. Sustainable practices are not new for beauty, and an increasing number of consumers are choosing natural, vegan, and medically approved products over the more traditional. In 2022, the beauty industry \u2014 which includes skin care, fragrance, cosmetics, and hair care \u2014 generated approximately $430 billion in revenue, according to The State of Fashion: Beauty 2023 report by McKinsey & Co. Regionally, North America is accounting for $85 billion of the industry in 2022 and expected to reach approximately $115 billion by 2027. Projected Year-over-year growth from 2022-2027 Fragrance 7% growth Cosmetics 6% growth Hair Care 6% growth Skin Care 6% growth with 45% of market value Regionally, the report shows that Middle East and Africa will grow the most at 12% YoY to 2027, with China at 8%, and APAC (not including China) at 7%. More than half of respondents to McKinsey\u2019s 2023 global consumer survey said they use three or more brands for skin care, hair care and fragrance, while one-third use five or more brands for cosmetics. Profitable, sustained growth over the coming years will depend on supercharged innovation, according to McKinsey\u2019s report. Brand portfolios need to adapt to rapid product lifecycles, with \u201chero\u201d products no longer the primary way to win with customers. Competition is intensifying, as is consumer desire to put to work a full range of beauty products that help them to look and feel their best. 42% of survey respondents across the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and China say they enjoy trying new brands. \u2013 McKinsey\u2019s The State of Fashion: Beauty 2023 report Channels Consumers readily buy beauty products at department stores, grocery stores, ecommerce, drugstores, travel retail, and specialty stores. Purchasing through e-commerce has jumped between 2015 and 2022 with a share over 20%. It is the fastest-growing segment for beauty products with YoY growth to 2027 expected at 12%. Travel retail is at 10%; specialty retail is forecast to grow 7%; grocery retail and drugstore tie at 4%; and department store and \u201cother\u201d will see a 2% YoY growth. Between 2015 and 2022, global e-commerce sales grew at a CAGR of 20% with significant growth during the pandemic, especially for eye makeup and skin care products (due to wearing masks). By 2022, digital shopping overtook specialty retail as the largest individual sales channel worldwide, with around one-fifth of the industry\u2019s overall total. So far this year, 31% of digital buyers in the US spent between $1 and $50 per month on beauty products on average, a Statista report shows. Social Media To see how beauty products can be applied and how they rate with consumers, there is no other place than social media. It is the top channel for new product reviews, thanks in most part to Generation Z. These teens and 20-somethings reign supreme as beauty influencers as well as offering views on what beauty means today. Beauty companies, influencers, and consumers alike make trends known with video reviews of beauty products and application how-tos on TikTok and Instagram. In addition to the two most popular, other platforms include YouTube for even more how-to and review videos, and Facebook, and Twitter. Today, consumers are following advice from dermatologists and other medical professionals over celebrity influencers, showing that they are serious about their skin, hair, and facial needs for the future. Top 5 Beauty & Personal Care Trends Research group Euromonitor International has revealed the top 5 trends. Premiumization and affordability Ingredient-led beauty Blurring wellness spaces Supporting health & wellness From function to emotion 1. Premiumization and affordability As beauty and health products become more expensive due to recent inflation increases, consumers are forced to make more selective decisions when it comes to the products they buy. According to Euromonitor International\u2019s Voice of the Consumer: Beauty Survey in summer 2022, more global respondents in 2022 sought out price-sensitive attributes (value for money, multi-functional benefits, low price) when shopping for skin care compared to 2021. This is an increase of approximately 2.5%. The survey results suggest that more quality seekers and premium buyers sought lower prices, such as through promotions or price-accessible brands in 2022 year compared to 2021. As 2023 progresses, the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is expected to evolve as beauty consumers reconsider their spending habits, such as efficacy seekers being more price sensitive in 2022 vs 2021. 2. Ingredient-led beauty The use of science in beauty products is nothing new, but biotechnology is taking it to a whole new level. There are many brands today that are catering to eco-conscious consumers with products made from plant-based ingredients. This moves the needle on consumer trust of the brand due to familiarity of formulations. Beauty consumers are seeking sustainability, biotech, and international beauty concepts. Essentially combining environmental sustainability with advances in biotech, \u201cgreen chemistry,\u201d which focuses on eliminating hazardous substances and adding or replacing previous ingredients with biobased ones, has emerged as a major focus area among beauty and personal care companies. \u201cUpcycling\u201d is the latest green chemistry innovation, which refers to the transformation of a by-product or waste stream to a usable ingredient and is a segment that is expected to accelerate in 2023. 3. Blurring wellness spaces Driven by increasing consumer demand for holistic health and prevention since COVID-19, companies have rushed to merge traditional portfolios with emerging health needs, says Euromonitor. This has resulted in blurring of the beauty and wellness spaces. Beauty is expected to strengthen its overlap with other industries, as well. \u201cLooking healthy\u201d was the #1 way beauty was perceived among global consumers. \u2013 Euromonitor International\u2019s Voice of the Consumer: Beauty Survey McKinsey\u2019s survey show that 45% of US consumers are interested in products that are 100% natural and are cruelty-free, not tested on animals \u2013 this percentage is roughly the same across the board in UK, France, Germany, Italy, and China. And 39% of US consumers look for products that do not use ingredients harmful to the environment. The report also reveals that the wellness industry, worth $1.5 trillion, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% to 2027. 4. Supporting health & wellness As female empowerment and gender inclusivity widens, a greater awareness of women\u2019s health will have a notable impact on the industry from 2023 onward. For instance, a greater understanding of how hormonal imbalances correlate with changing skin and hair needs presents prospects for alignment of beauty routines with tailored solutions across cycle care. This will be a natural extension to brand strategies that endorse a more holistic wellness-oriented approach. 5. From function to emotion Gen Z has defined the new beauty. Nearly 50% of them research beauty products extensively before purchasing, another fact from the McKinsey survey. Emotional values such as internal health benefits and social value identities have become essential factors in beauty consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions, the Euromonitor report reveals. Neuroscience, especially brain wave detection, is starting to be used as a biometric signal to evaluate emotional functionality. The concept of \u201cneuroscents\u201d which elicits emotional responses that are neurologically proven, opens new opportunities for fragrance and ingredient companies to provide the product and educate consumers on this emerging segment. Mergers & Acquisitions The number of M&A in 2019 and 2022 was nearly the same (174 and 175 respectively); however, in 2022 they were worth half the average value of 2019\u2019s deals, the McKinsey report shared. Of 139 deals that closed in 2022 and acquired stakes of 30% or more, 90% were conglomerates. To name a few bigger deals in 2022, Procter and Gamble acquired Tula, a probiotic skin care brand; Unilever acquired a majority stake in Nutrafol, which manufactures hair wellness products; L\u2019Or\u00e9al purchased Skinbetter Science, an American skin care brand; and Est\u00e9e Lauder Co. acquired Tom Ford brand, creator of fragrances and accessories. Sally Beauty \u2014 a leading retailer for salon-quality hair color, hair care, and nail products \u2014 has just entered into a retail agreement with XMONDO Color hair color brand. L'Or\u00e9al is also moving into another retail space. It's Professionnel's hair care line is now available on Sephora.com. Both reports and additional research have shown that beauty is competitive, growing, and extremely innovative. Demand will continue for beauty and personal care products that educate, delight, and provide value \u2014 both monetarily and ethically speaking.","filter_flag":1}

Its official launch was marked by an event held on August 15 which highlighted Aveda's capabilities in the professional salon setting. During the event, Kelly Park, vice president and general manager of Aveda Asia Pacific, expressed excitement over Aveda\u2019s launch in Vietnam. \u201cVietnam is the most vibrant market in South East Asia. It\u2019s such an untapped opportunity. I cannot express enough how tremendously honoured and excited I am about Aveda\u2019s launch in the Vietnam market, a place of unlimited potential and growth.\u200b \u201cVietnam is a perfect mix of professional hair care with a huge salon industry and desirability for prestige hair care. So, we believe Aveda has a huge opportunity in the Vietnam market.\u201d\u200b Park told CosmeticsDesign-Asia\u200b that Aveda is aiming to become the top omnichannel luxury hair care brand in Vietnam. It is working to unveil more direct-to-consumer touchpoints, both online and offline. \u201cEspecially beautiful Aveda boutiques and counters at top shopping locations across Vietnam, especially Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi,\u201d \u200bsaid Park. It was also imperative to build the vegan brand across the professional channel in Vietnam as a natural and high-performance alternative to other more conventional salon brands. \u201c[We want Aveda] to be the top-of-mind and first-choice hair care brand among the amazing thriving community of talented hairdressers and network of salons in Vietnam because they know that they can depend on Aveda\u2019s rituals and products to work wonders and delight consumers,\u201d \u200bsaid Park. Trends taking root in Vietnam Aveda partnered with Singapore-based omnichannel distributor LUXASIA for its entry into Vietnam. The latter previously worked with the brand in markets including Singapore, Malaysia and the Phillippines. Speaking to us, LUXASIA echoed Aveda\u2019s excitement and confidence in the Vietnam venture. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with a big population and an emerging, more affluent middle class. With the urbanisation of the market, we\u2019re seeing the modernisation of shopping malls, department stores and also salons,\u201d\u200b said Dinh Nguyen, country manager of LUXASIA Vietnam. Nguyen highlighted that these emerging consumers were looking for the cream of the crop, which was now synonymous with safety and environmental responsibility. He added that Aveda\u2019s eco-credentials totally resonated with the modern Vietnamese consumer. \u201cThe consumer today expects the best, and the best means safe beauty, cruelty-free beauty, and natural beauty. They are now starting to think about their social responsibility to the environment and are more conscious about their health,\u201d \u200bhe said. One of the trends taking root strongly in Vietnam is the demand for vegan products, Nguyen highlighted. \u201cPeople in Vietnam were hungry for something new, and vegan is something that was totally new that attracted more knowledgeable consumers. Right now, it\u2019s an emerging opportunity,\u201d \u200bsaid Nguyen. In Vietnam, luxury hair care is still a nascent segment. It only accounts for 6.6% of overall premium beauty and personal care, signalling huge potential for the premium hair segment to grow. Raymond Tan, regional general manager of Aveda LUXASIA noted that many luxury brands have recognised the untapped opportunities in Vietnam and it was important for Aveda to be one of the pioneers. \u201cThis year especially, we have seen a lot of luxury brands wanting to come to Vietnam to sell. And that's why we see the opportunity for Aveda to come in as the first mover before the rest of the luxury brands come in.\u201d\u200b Being first to market is also important because Vietnam does not have much retail space to offer for now. \u201cEspecially in Ho Chi Minh City, the number of quality department stores or shopping malls is quite limited. They have not been on that retail journey but in the next three to five years, you will see it moving. They are already building a lot of malls in Hanoi now,\u201d \u200bsaid Tan. Reinventing the salon experience\u200b One of the most exciting channels for Aveda is the professional channel as it is able to create a new salon experience for Vietnamese consumers. Using essential oils and sprays, the brand can bring a new holistic dimension to elevate the most basic cut-and-colour sessions to a luxury hair pampering experience. \u201cConsumers are not just simply looking for a haircut or hair-colouring session solely when they visit a salon these days. They are looking for an entire mind and body experience, a total wellness experience. Furthermore, Vietnamese consumers are increasingly desiring the luxury experience,\u201d\u200b said Tan. \u201cUsing essential oils, sprays, and massages, even teas prepared for the guests, these are elements which make the Aveda experience incomparable and is truly what set it apart from the competitors.\u201d\u200b Tan highlighted the importance of securing partnerships with the top-tier hair salons in Vietnam, noting that their influence will cascade down to other salons and eventually the end-consumers. \u201cWe need the very top tier salons in the market influencers. We want the leaders of this entire hair salon industry to use this brand and other will want to be part of this family too.\u201d\u200b According to the firm, Aveda has experienced double-digit year-on-year growth in neighbouring SEA markets Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. \u201cThe future in bright for Aveda in Vietnam as we ride on the high social media connectedness of consumers, the increasing propensity to indulge in luxury among the growing middle-class, the emerging sustainability and wellness trend which are aligned with Aveda\u2019s brand ethos and values,\u201d \u200bsaid Tan.","filter_flag":1}
