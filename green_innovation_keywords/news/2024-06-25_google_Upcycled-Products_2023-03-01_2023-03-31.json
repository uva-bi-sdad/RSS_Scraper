The goal is to make ingredients that reduce food waste a larger part of food production, they say, and at the same time pave the way for further development of process technology and innovation in the upcycling of side streams from the food industry. The global products from food waste market size was valued at nearly $53 (\u20ac49.63) billion in 2022, according to a recent report by Future Market Insights. It estimates the market will grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to reach $83.26 (\u20ac77.9) billion by 2032. The collaboration therefore comes at \u2018exactly the right time because the demand for innovation in the upcycling area has never been greater\u2019, according to the companies. Spent hens: a \u2018significant untapped resource\u2019 The collaboration has so far launched with a series of organic flavour enhancers based on side streams from the food industry. One is fermented sauce made with chicken, koji and barley which makes use of spent laying hens sourced from Danish organic egg production. Spent hens are those at the end of their egg-laying cycle. With meat that\u2019s too tough to eat, their commercial value has tended to be low. Typically, after being processed into \u2018chick pulp\u2019 in mobile chicken slaughter units they go on to be used in animal feed or for biogas production. They are often discarded. In Denmark alone, 8 million kilos of organic chickens are wasted annually. According to Reduced\u2019s co-founder Emil Munck de Voss, these spent lying hens \u2013 Denmark is also estimated to currently house around 4.5 million hens in egg production \u2013 represent a \u201csignificant untapped resource if we are able to scale the conversion of these hens into human food. It is believed that the prices obtained for human food applications may be higher than those achieved for pet food or biogas purposes.\u201d In the past, spent hen meat did go into soups. Today, however, most soup makers will use broiler meat to avoid bone splinters that can make the product unsafe for human consumption. Reduced, on the other hand, is using fermentation techniques to create products for human food applications. \u201cWe have been able to control a natural fermentation process at industrial scale,\u201d de Voss told FoodNavigator. \u201cWe combine fungi with chicken and are then able to control the critical control parameters throughout the process and then extract the super umami-rich liquid by the end of this natural process that is organically certified and authorized by the food authorities from nine months of testing.\u201d Upcycling wasted mushrooms\u200b The Reduced\/Caldic collaboration is also using Danish organic button mushrooms to produce umami flavouring. Industrial producers of Agaricus Bisporus\u200b mushrooms, which make up 45% of global mushroom production, have an 8-10% waste rate on all production every year, claimed de Voss. \u201cFor our partner in Denmark, that amounts to 203 tonnes of wasted organic Agaricus Bisporus\u200b a year. The mushrooms we are using usually are discarded for retail sales because they are too large, or too small to be packaged, broken or bruised. We use them for organic, clean label and great-tasting food ingredients and thereby we reduce food waste.\u201d The flavour enhancers are distinguished by boosting the umami taste without containing additives, continued de Voss. So far, they have been used in meat products, meat hybrids and meat alternatives to reduce raw material costs, lower salt content and enhance flavour. \u201cOur ingredients have the potential to lower costs by enabling the creation of meat hybrids,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough a series of formulations, we have demonstrated that meat content in processed meat products can be reduced by 5-20% and substituted with vegetables and our flavour enhancers. This not only maintains the great taste but also lowers the cost by removing expensive meat content. We have demonstrated cost savings in between 5-10% working with formulations of sausages and beef patties.\u201d Significantly less production time\u200b The main applications of the Reduced current portfolio include soups, ready meals, culinary sauces and the Danish start-up makes novel use of other side streams. In addition to its chicken- and mushroom-based umami flavours, it has made: shellfish stock from the invasive species of shore crabs on the Danish coast; organic vegetable stock made from Nordic seaweed; and organic veal stock made from bones from bull calves, which are left over from milk production. \u201cWe have developed a unique process for controlling the fermentation and processing of the ingredients in our bioreactors,\u201d explained the co-founder. \u201cThis enables us to create uniform and food-safe ingredients at scale.\u201d The technology is centred around controlling fermentation processes of side streams and generating flavours at accelerated production time, he told us. \u201cRight now, we are building out the range of side streams we can process through the process technology to provide a broader portfolio of flavours. So - you can definitely expect new taste and flavour experiences.\u201d Furthermore, we have begun developing functional systems that combine multiple components of ingredients to provide even greater value to our customers in terms of easy application, flavors, and cost-effectiveness. The appeal of upcycling for end consumers \u200b Consumer interest in upcycled products is growing, added Ib Mortensen, Product Group Leader at Caldic. \u201cMy impression is that there is a very high interest in upcycled products \u2013 more so when the concept is coupled with sustainability than as a standalone, where the concept can sometimes be a bit too technical,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the more the food producers work with story telling the more they will succeed with the ingredients. There is a high awareness among most consumers \u2013 certainly in the Nordics, but I believe it is true of most European countries \u2013 about the need to take care of our planet and to use its resources with care \u2013 and although there is now a pressure on peoples\u2019 wallets, which will reduce over time, the interest in and awareness of protecting our environment is still very much present.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Continue reading below Our Featured Videos The problem with municipal recycling is that only a few materials are profitable enough to recycle. All other materials take too much time, energy, machinery and manpower to be worthwhile. With this in mind, TerraCycle takes a full-cycle view of ways to keep waste out of landfills, roping businesses and other stakeholders into the process. Related: New solar-powered robots will clean up Argentina\u2019s waterways The TerraCycle recycling program mirrors most similar operations. Shipments of waste arrive at one of the company\u2019s 35 Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs), which are located in the same country in which the waste originates. The waste is then sorted by material makeup, using a variety of innovative machinery and manpower. Once sorted, materials are sent to third party partners who process it into usable forms. This might be plastic pellets or metal sheeting, for example. Recycled materials are then given new life in a wide variety of products. Manufacturing companies use the newly-raw materials from TerraCycle to produce outdoor furniture and decking, watering cans, flooring tiles, playground surface covers, athletic fields, planters, compost bins and much more. TerraCycle even sells a small selection of upcycled products directly from its website. TerraCycle is a global program, yet also a community-based one. Presently operating in 21 countries, materials are collected worldwide. However, the power of collection happens at a community level where businesses and individuals can set up collection centers. The setup is easy and anyone can do it, although a fee is charged up front so businesses are often the best option for sponsoring boxes. Simply apply for the program and request boxes. When the boxes are filled, send them back using a prepaid shipping label at no cost. TerraCycle partners with an array of businesses who sponsor different recycling efforts. For example, Subaru (the car maker) offers drop-off locations at many of their dealerships where customers can drop disposable cups, lids, straws, candy and snack wrappers and coffee and creamer capsules. Several other recycling programs accept pet food bags and pouches, including Wellness, Holistic, A Pup Above and Halo. Similarly, there are programs for many lotions, face cream and other beauty products. Gatorade allows you to recycle Gatorade, Propel, EVOLVE and Muscle Milk sports nutrition pods and bar packaging. Other packaging waste includes toddler squeeze tubes, drink pouches, cigarette waste, clothing, cooking supplies, ink pens, and aerosol cans. Notable brands include Arm and Hammer, OxyClean, Barilla, Babybel, Burt\u2019s Bees, Colgate, Febreze, Gillette, Hasbro, Lundberg, Popsockets, Rubbermaid, Swiffer, Taco Bell, Ziploc and many, many more. Since shipping items is an essential part of the process, TerraCycle works to minimize its carbon footprint with zero-carbon shipping on the initial box delivery and boxes made from certified responsibly-sourced forest products. Upon return, the plastic liner and the cardboard box are recycled. The company has also developed the Zero Waste Case, which is used to ship the Zero Waste Boxes. The case is made from 100% recycled PET (or polyethylene terephthalate, represented by resin code #1 on plastic containers) and TerraCycle encourages customers to reuse the case. If you no longer want the case, you can send it back to the company for use on future Zero Waste Box orders. TerraCycle is constantly investing in the research and development of new recycling processes with the goal of converting waste into usable products at the highest level. The company reports nearly all of the products returned are reused and that only a very small percentage is incinerated \u2014 basically only those items that shouldn\u2019t be in the bin or those that are legally required to be incinerated, such as medical waste. In addition to recycling plastic and other waste, the TerraCycle Global Foundation arm of the company is working to clean up waterways with the goal of collecting waste in rivers before it reaches the ocean where it impacts the marine animals and ecosystem. The foundation achieves this mission by working with local communities who are highly impacted by water pollution. River traps help in the collection of waste from the waterways. The collected materials are then sent to a sorting center where they are weighed, sorted and baled. The system creates local jobs and workers are supported by the TerraCycle foundation. The company explained, \u201cThe Foundation works with local waste pickers to improve collection rates by providing fair wages, tools, supplies, financial literacy, education, care for children, and health and safety training.\u201d The foundation\u2019s project is funded through the sale of bracelets, frisbees and other products, which are made out of the waste materials collected from the water. + TerraCycle Images via TerraCycle","filter_flag":1}

They are available in three flavours, namely salt and pepper pumpkin, cauliflower, and chilli and lime broccoli. Tapping on the relationship with Fresh Select \u2013 the main vegetable producer for Coles, the snacks are sold in 800 of its supermarkets, both in-store and online. Nutri V goodies' range \u00a9 Nutri V The firm was previously primarily supplying vegetable powders to food manufacturers to incorporate into crackers, dips, breads, and snacks. CEO Raquel Said told NutraIngredients-Asia\u200b that the new launch would meet a clear customer need: \u201cA lot of people were saying that they want an option for kids to have in their lunch boxes, and we want to drive nutrition in a convenient way. Anytime I was talking to people about product offerings, they ask when they can get their hands on the powder - to have a scoop of that in their foods. There were obvious next steps for us in terms of new product offerings as it makes sense to what consumer want and it\u2019s also solving a problem in the farms,\u201d \u200bSaid explained. New product development\u200b The firm will next launch its vegetable powder pouches in the consumer space, and has been working on product development opportunities spanning yoghurts, drinks, and even enhanced pet foods. On the consumer trends driving growth in the space, its CEO said: \u201cEspecially in the snacking space, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of better-for-you trends. Companies want to take something that is indulgent and make it slightly better for you. Like adding a few profiles to banana bread and cupcakes. We\u2019re also seeing interesting flavour pairings with vegetables\u200b [to] really enhance the flavours, like \u200bbroccoli with lemon, salt, and pepper.\u201d\u200b Aside from nutritional benefits, Said added that vegetable powder also functions well as a binder or emulsifier. She sees the potential of \u201chybrid products\u201d in the plant-based market, such as creating nuggets with both chicken and vegetable powder. In line with its new product development plan is consumer education to provide more ways to access and consume vegetable powder, and the firm would be looking at partnerships with chefs for recipe ideas. \u201cWe're not saying that these should replace fresh bread and fresh vegetables. But if they can take you top up your servings of vegetables, then we've made a difference. If we can add a little bit of extra nutrition into people's diets in a convenient way, then we've been able to do our job.\u201d\u200b Nutri V was founded in 2020 via a partnership\u200b between vegetable producer Fresh Select, and Australia\u2019s national science agency CSIRO. Said explained how the partnership came about: \u201c[Fresh Select and CSIRO] were basically looking at a project to see how we can use farm waste, and vegetables that don\u2019t make it to the supermarket shelves. These vegetables just don\u2019t meet certain specifications and the way they look might be slightly different, but I\u2019ll be clear that there\u2019s nothing nutritionally wrong with them.\u200b \u201c\u200bOur business model is that we take the vegetables, not just from our parent farm [at Fresh Select] but from farms across Melbourne and other states. We turn them into vegetable powders. That turns them into very nutrient-dense, small serving sized ingredient as we are essentially taking out the water. There is a large array of applications used from F&B to nutraceuticals.\u201d\u200b Two areas for future innovation are microencapsulation and fermentation. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a patented product with them around microencapsulation. What we\u2019re seeing is an appetite for vegetable, plant-based Omega-3 and this is sort of in the nutraceutical space. We\u2019re still in R&D at the moment. It\u2019s an exciting space for food and nutraceuticals, and it\u2019s what customers are asking for as well.\u200b \u201cThe second project is around fermentation. Those are novel ingredients that will be developed and launched in the marketplace. It is probably still a bit too early to talk about. But there's some new novel technology that's coming as well with our partnership,\u201d \u200bSaid elaborated. The firm is also assessing if its business model has the potential to scale. \u201cAt the present moment, the only facility we have is in the South - in Victoria. It can only process a certain amount of vegetables into powders. However, we know that there\u2019s a waste problem with vegetables not just here, but in Queensland, Western Australia, and other parts of the world. \u200b \u201cWe would really be interested to look at what our business model could look like if we take what we\u2019ve done here and putting in other parts of the world or in Australia \u2013 to turn that waste into new foods.\u201d\u200b","filter_flag":1}

Panera, Chipotle and Just Salad were the first restaurants to include carbon emissions on menu items. The labels estimate a food\u2019s environmental impact as a carbon equivalent reflecting the greenhouse gas emissions or CO2 spent in the entire journey of a food product, from growing to transportation to cooking or production. This environmental impact is measured in grams or kilograms of carbon. Now there\u2019s an entire movement to put climate change on the menu \u2013 from \u201cclimate positive\u201d entrees to entire restaurants that are certified carbon-free. In the supermarket, foods and beverages are embellished with on-package seals that declare \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d or \u201cclimate neutral.\u201d Do Eco-Labels Matter? I\u2019ll breakdown many of the label claim definitions, but let\u2019s start with the question if these eco-labels can make a difference. Two recent studies suggest they do have the potential to nudge consumers to more climate-responsible food choices. One study conducted by researchers from Harvard and Johns Hopkins found that people may be less likely to choose red meat items from menus that were labeled \u201chigh climate impact.\u201d The beef burger on the menu included the description: \u201cThis item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change.\u201d Researchers at the University of Bristol in the U.K. found similar results in a study that used a traffic light system to rank eco-friendliness of menu items. The green traffic light symbol on a vegetarian burrito helped to significantly increase the likelihood that this more sustainable option was selected. Additionally, 90% of the study participants were supportive of eco-labels. Keep in mind, both of these studies were online experiments exposing people to hypothetical menu items instead of ordering at an actual restaurant. Yet the researchers believe the findings suggest eco-labels have the potential to make a positive impact in real-world settings. Seeking More Sustainable Choices Increasingly people are eager to make changes to their behaviors to benefit the planet. Over three-quarters (78%) agree they want to buy from companies that help them achieve a more sustainable and socially responsible life, according to GreenPrint\u2019s Business of Sustainability Index. They\u2019ll even pay more for sustainable products, yet 78% of those surveyed say that, despite their desire to support companies that align with their values, they don\u2019t know how to identify environmentally friendly companies. Here\u2019s where eco-labels could help. Over two-thirds (68%) use labels to determine if a product is environmentally friendly, with that number jumping to 78% for Generation Z and Millennial consumers. What Different Eco-Labels Mean Some of the so-called green and ethical labels have been around for years, such as USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, Fair Trade Certified, Rainforest Alliance Certified and Certified Humane Raised & Handled. Here\u2019s a look at some of the newer eco-labels used in the food industry and what they mean. Carbon Neutral Certified Carbon neutral or carbon free does not mean a food produces zero emissions. It refers instead to a company compensating for all of the carbon or greenhouse gases emitted during its production and delivery. That\u2019s where third-party organizations come in, such as Carbonfund. that helps companies calculate, reduce and offset their carbon footprint with projects that remove an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere. Carbonfund\u2019s Certified Carbonfree\u00ae products have \"net zero\" CO2 emissions, meaning brands measure and offset the carbon footprint of the products over their full lifecycle. This lifecycle focus is also called \u201ccradle-to-grave,\u201d which means the calculation includes the ingredient sourcing and packaging, product manufacturing, distribution, consumer use and eventual disposal. Carbon Trust is another organization offering carbon neutral certification for products. The group has certified over 27,000 individual product footprints, and many display the label in more than 40 countries. Climate Neutral Certified This label is certified by a nonprofit group called Climate Neutral that\u2019s on a mission to make climate neutrality a priority for companies and individuals. Similar to Carbonfund, they work with companies to measure, reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions with carbon credit investments that help to capture carbon \u2013 projects that include reforestation, mangrove rehabilitation, and landfill management. More than 300 brands have been certified by Climate Neutral, including Zero Carbon Coffee, Numi Organic Tea, and Bud Light Next. Regenerative Organic Certified Regenerative agriculture is often referred to as carbon farming because it restores soil biology, which pulls carbon out of the atmosphere. Regenerative organic agriculture is a collection of practices that focus on regenerating soil health and the entire farm ecosystem \u2013 from the animals to the workers. Developed by the nonprofit Regenerative Organic Alliance, this certification uses the USDA Certified Organic standard as a baseline and adds criteria for soil health, animal welfare and social fairness. The alliance was founded by the Rodale Institute, Dr. Bronner\u2019s and Patagonia. Other members include Compassion in World Farming, Fair World Project and the Textile Exchange. Although \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d has become a popular buzzword, the term is not fully defined and the claim is not regulated. Upcycled Certified Upcycled products are made with ingredients that would have otherwise been thrown out, such as the pulp created when fruits are turned into juice, the spent grain from the beer-making process or the cacao beans that are wasted when making chocolate. This new certification program was developed by the Upcycled Food Association, which has certified more than 200 food products and ingredients \u2013 representing 840 million pounds of food waste. One third of all food produced in the world ends up wasted, which accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Upcycled Certification on-package mark signifies that a specified amount of upcycled ingredients were used. Upcycled certified products include ReGrained bread mixes, Pulp Pantry vegetable chips and Blue Stripes Urban Cacao chocolate bars and cacao water. Certified B Corporations While the Certified B Corporation label does not make any claim about a specific food, it does flag a company\u2019s commitment to meet standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from supply chain practices and input materials to charitable giving and employee benefits. The certification is managed by B Lab, a nonprofit organization \u201ctransforming the global economy to benefit all people, communities and the planet.\u201d The pledge serves as a legal framework for the company's corporate structure, which is intended to help balance profit with purpose. Carbon Confusion Eco-labels have exploded in recent years, totaling 456 globally, according to the Ecolabel Index, a directory of eco-labels across 25 industry categories including food. But not everyone agrees this is a positive trend. Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in the department of environmental studies at New York University, believes the \u201cclimate neutral\u201d or \u201cclimate positive\u201d claims are confusing and misleading. Actually, these foods do not even exist, he says. The trouble is that these claims rely on carbon offsets \u2013 or those projects that are attempting to compensate for a product\u2019s own emissions. While carbon offsets can play a role, it is important to ensure that offset projects are transparent, verifiable and result in real, permanent and additional emissions reductions, he says. Few of these labels give shoppers meaningful guidance in choosing environmentally superior products, he says. You may be tempted to choose an item with a \u201cclimate neutral\u201d label because the item next to it does not make that claim. Yet, he says the non-labeled item could have a 10 times lower carbon footprint. \u201cIf you are feeling confused, there\u2019s probably someone trying to confuse you,\u201d Hayek says. What You Should Do So what should you do? Rather than relying on eco-labels, which may be providing an undeserved green halo, eat more plants and waste less food, Hayek says. Reducing meat and wasting none of it will go a long way in reducing your own personal carbon footprint at home. He also suggests paying attention to the label that really matters \u2013 the nutrition facts panel on the back of the package, which is federally-regulated, transparent and benefits from decades of hard science, all things that the current slate of climate labels lack.","filter_flag":1}

It got me thinking that if this was a problem for most people, there needed to be a sustainable solution,\u201d says Sujata, in a conversation with HerStory. Researching her problem, Sujata realised that fabric wastage was a huge global issue, one that was rarely talked about. \u201cThere are World Economic Forum reports that say that up to 60% of all manufactured clothes are actually wasted. I found that no organisation was working on this, nobody was talking about it. I also realised that while I have excess in my wardrobe, there are so many who need these clothes and so many other women who need a livelihood,\u201d Sujata says. Keen to figure out a solution, the engineer in her launched Kolkata-based \ufeffTwirl.Store\ufeff. Sujata set out on her entrepreneurial journey in 2017 as an initiative to \u201creduce cloth wastage, encourage women empowerment, conserve natural resources like water, and meet the clothing needs of the less fortunate\u201d. The founder felt it was important to build a solution that helped society at large and the environment, and \u201cget the conversation started\u201d. Twirl collects all unwanted clothing and fabric from individuals and organisations. A section of these are given to people in slums and villages for use. The rest of the material is upcycled into new products such as bags, accessories, and gift items, sold online and offline. People who donate are rewarded them with points that can be redeemed to buy upcycled products on the website. \u201cAll work is done by rural women. We convert waste into beautiful eco-friendly, handcrafted products,\u201d says Sujata, who had no idea about fashion or the world of entrepreneurship. However, she learnt everything on the job. She says she faced an uphill battle when she started as her model was unique. Most people were naysayers and believed she would never be able to be successful \u201cwith zero experience in the space\u201d and by basing herself in Kolkata. \u201cMany told me that I should move to Bengaluru or Delhi, or go abroad. Also, solo women founders have it tough. Everyone wanted a male counterpart,\u201d she recalls, adding that she decided to run the business out of Kolkata and only with women. Today, Twirl is an all women organisation and has a team of over 20. Advising all women, Sujata says, \u201cBelieve in yourself, because if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, nobody will.

Mushrooms? Fungi? \"The Last of Us\"? Absolutely nothing? What about steaks? At the 2023 Natural Products Expo West show in Anaheim, Calif., March 7-11, mycelium steaks were on the menu, along with other trendy new products such as cassava tortillas, baru nut trail mixes, nootropic drinks and a new plant-based milk made from bamnuts. [Read more: \"Expo West Live: Inflation-Proof Categories Driving Sales for Grocers\"] For five days, more than 85,000 attendees hit the show floor, which was packed with more than 3,000 exhibitors, including Meati, maker of the mycelium steaks. Meati's Classic Steak Best New Meat Alternative at the 2023 Natural Products Expo West NEXTY Awards. \u201cThe NEXTY award is the crown jewel of the natural and organic food industry, and we\u2019re honored to be recognized as we launch nationally with Sprouts Farmers Market,\u201d said Scott Tassani, president and COO of Meati Foods. \u201cAfter years spent developing an animal-free meat that delivers flavor, nutrition, clean ingredients and sustainability, it\u2019s especially meaningful to be recognized as a standout given the incredible food innovation and discriminating standards that push this industry forward.\u201d Meati's Classic Steak aims to deliver a complete-protein, clean-label beef alternative that appeals not only to the natural products shopper but also to the everyday consumer looking to diversify with animal-free options. It is composed of more than 95% mycelium (mushroom root), with the remaining 5% comprising salt, natural flavor, fruit juice for color, oat fiber, vegetable juice and lycopene for color, providing 30% DV of protein, 29% DV of fiber and a plethora of micronutrients. The Boulder, Colorado-based startup founded in 2017 has raised an additional $20 million in funding since announcing a $150 million series C round last summer, bringing its cumulative funding to $250 million. Meati is one in a long list of new companies at Expo West trying to create buzz around next-gen plant-based products in categories such as candy, snacks, beverages and cereal. Along with Meati, Progressive Grocer identified nine other hot products or trends expected to grow in popularity in the coming year that grocers could leverage to boost sales. Nootropics and Adaptogenics Nootropic is the buzzy attribute that natural and organic shoppers are looking for in their foods, and even their drinks, now. One nootropics-focused company at Expo West was Local Weather, a functional sports drink made for \"however you choose to move, without leaving your mind behind.\" The beverage is made for roller skating, gaming or \"just chillin\" after a jump-rope marathon, the brand says. It's proper hydration for your body as well as your brain, superpowered with nootropics, and only 6 grams of cane sugar. Made cleaner, healthier and friendlier, to regulate your own personal \u201clocal weather,\u201d the brand says. Meanwhile, other brands such as Mindright offer new chips and protein bars filled with nootropics. Speaking of functional beverages and foods, adaptogenic products were booming at Expo West. Space Tea, which calls itself the world's first adaptogenic mushroom, iced tea and lemonade beverage, showcased six flavors: Original, Golden Mango, Summer Watermelon, Lemon Zero, Hibiscus Zero and Matcha Zero. Space Tea is certified organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and kosher. Adaptogenics are everywhere, including in mocktails, trail mix and sparkling waters. Water-Neutral Water While many water companies at Expo West were focused on getting out of single-use plastic and into aluminum cans, FreshPure Waters was focused on being \"water neutral.\" According to the company, it's the only water brand that offsets all carbon and water used in its manufacturing processes. Water neutral also means the company is investing in watersheds. Bulk water is already 1,2000% more green than bottled, the company says, so by going water neutral, the brand can keep expanding its sustainability commitments. Anti-Bloat Prebiotics, probiotics, post-biotics and everything everywhere all at once having to do with taking care of the gut were big themes in products at this year's show. Spare Tonic is one brand focused on gut health. The probiotic sparkling tonics come in flavors such as passionfruit yuzu; blueberry ginger; cucumber lime; lemon ginger; peach turmeric, and feature nutrients such as protein, B vitamins, electrolytes, and gut-healthy probiotics while low in calories and sugar. Meanwhile the front of the package of Enzymedica's pre- and probiotic Blueberry Fiber Cookies says \"FOR YOUR DIGESTIVE HAPPINESS; BEAT THE BLOAT.\" The cookies contain a probiotic called MB40 that is \"clinically proven to beat the bloat,\" the company says. The New High Fiber Speaking of gut health, it was amazing to see so many innovative brands making high-fiber sexy again. One such brand is Fiber Gourmet. The company has developed a line of low calorie, low carb and high fiber foods for those consumers looking to indulge in pasta, crackers and \"other comfort foods.\" Founder Tehila Mocton's products feature RS4, a good-for-you fiber-boosting starch that weighs in at a slim 0.4 calories per gram, compared to traditional flour at 4 calories per gram. According to the company, RS4 passes through the stomach and small intestine to reach the colon. There, it converts into short-chain fatty acids, feeding good bacteria. Fiber from RS4 is a natural appetite suppressant that helps you feel fuller for longer, meaning less snacking and more weight loss. And RS4 can help regulate blood sugar by bypassing digestion and reducing average levels over time. BFY 'Junk Food' Quite possibly the biggest crowd I saw on the show floor was the one at the Goodles booth. People were \"ooohing\" and \"ahhing\" over their high-protein prebiotic mac and cheese. How can a brand with such a great name possibly go wrong? Founded in 2022 by actress Gal Gadot, 4x CEO Jen Zeszut, former Annie's President Deb Luster, brand entrepreneur Paul Earle, and R&D leader Molly Michet, Goodles is reinventing the better-for-you junk food category with style. Quest Nutrition was at the show showcasing its Doritos-style chips, and Dole Packaged Foods showed off its new Dole Whip at home products. Upcycled Foods Food waste is an increasingly big issue in grocery, and cutting back on it was a hot topic at the show. I saw more brands than ever showing off their Certified Upcycled labels. The Upcycled Certified Program is the world\u2019s first third-party certification program for upcycled food ingredients and products. The flagship of the program is the on-package mark, which helps retailers feature upcycled products on shelf, and indicates to consumers which products are upcycled certified, providing the opportunity to prevent food waste with every purchase. Developed by the Upcycled Food Association, the mark highlights upcycled ingredients and products procured and produced with surplus food or food by-products from manufacturing, that use verifiable supply chains and have a positive impact on the environment. One such company was RIND, which says it believes a healthy snack can be both good for you and the planet. \"Our mission is to help consumers SNACK BETTER and DO BETTER by eating the whole fruit, maximizing nutritional value and minimizing food waste,\" according to the company's website. In 2021, eating RIND products helped save more than 340,000 pounds of food waste, the company says. Frozen Innovations Frozen foods are hot as inflation-battered shoppers look to save money on groceries, and there was plenty of frozen innovation at Expo West. One such innovator was Bobabam; with their product, you can just warm up the frozen boba, add milk and bam \u2014 you have the boba teahouse experience at home. Fabalish has new falafel bites that come in cute flavors such as Cheddary Broccoli, Zesty Zucchini and Kickin' Carrot. The bites are vegan, gluten-free, organic, allergen free and made with whole veggies. And I can't forget to mention Swell, the first ever gelato made for dogs. According to the Oregon-based company, Swell was created out of nostalgia for a time when food was prepared with simple yet wholesome ingredients to be shared with those you love. Each of Swell's gelatos is handmade and crafted in small batches, making them unique and delicious. They come in six flavors with \"100% natural ingredients.\" Certified B Another certification that people were buzzing about at Expo West was Certified B. More and more companies are choosing to certify as a B Corp., which designates that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability and transparency on factors ranging from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials. Mega Foods, Portlandia Foods, Partake Foods, Pitaya Foods, Miyoko's Creamery, and others are part of a growing list of Certified B food companies. Low Sodium Salt As more U.S. consumers look to reduce their sodium intake, here comes MicroSalt, a developer and manufacturer of a proprietary low-sodium salt called MicroSalt. According to the company website, \"We are passionate about improving peoples\u2019 lives with better-for-you seasonings and snacks by taking the lead in the industry by providing the best low-sodium salt solution, based on the mechanical transformation of the salt particle itself.\" The company's patented technology produces salt crystals that are approximately one hundred times smaller than typical table salt, delivering a powerful saltiness as the micro-grains dissolve in the mouth, with approximately 50% less sodium consumption. Additionally, the ultra-small particle size enhances product adhesion, which reduces waste and provides improved flavor consistency.","filter_flag":1}

Not only do we have to focus on the hygiene of delivered food, but we also have to consider the problem of environmental pollution that comes with the overuse of plastic containers. After investigating the amount of plastic use for the 10 most popular delivery foods, a study published by the Korea Consumer Agency in February 2022 revealed that an average of 18.3 plastic containers were used per menu item. Reflecting the average number of food delivery orders, which is 2.8 times per week, 10.8kg of plastic containers are used annually per capita. Among these plastic containers, the recyclable ones were estimated to be only 45.5%, which is not even half. With the prolonging of the COVID-19 pandemic, the food delivery market expanded dramatically, followed by an increase in plastic use. According to Green Korea, consumers feel guilty about the huge amount of plastic containers that are involved in their food orders. A survey on how consumers feel when they throw away their food delivery trash showed that 42% answered that they feel uncomfortable and worried, and 34% responded that they feel guilty. Although it is best not to use plastic, using plastic is unavoidable. Therefore, multi-use containers are being suggested as an alternative, but South Korea is making slow progress on introducing relevant policies compared to other advanced countries such as Europe and Canada. However, little effort is being made to reduce the use of plastic containers for food delivery, such as giving consumers the option to select multi-use containers when they order their food. Through this system, food is packed and delivered in multi-use containers, after which the containers are picked up by a business specializing in multi-use containers. Currently, a number of restaurants in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, are engaging in this practice. Similarly, the Korea Environment Corporation and Seoul Metropolitan City have conducted a campaign to give consumers points for picking up their food with their own containers or plates. The use of multi-use containers, however, incurs expenses when they are picked up and washed, and these expenses are currently paid by consumers themselves or the public budget. As this financial burden has been pointed to as a limitation, some people insist that food delivery app companies should pay the expenses required for multi-use containers. Since such companies have increased in number and influence due to the prolonged COVID-19 crisis, some people say that they must take responsibility for their environmental impact, especially now that corporate social responsibility has become an important focus. Internationally, policies to reduce the use of plastic are being actively implemented. In the European Union, for example, the use of plastic containers is forbidden. Since last July, the 10 most widely used plastic products, such as food containers and vinyl bags, have been banned. In Canada, non-recyclable food delivery containers, vinyl bags, and plastic straws have been banned. The problem of plastic overuse has increased during the last three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming a global environmental issue. As important as policy-making is, changing the daily habits of consumers is also vital in order to reduce the use of plastic. To this end, the 5R's of waste management have been introduced as a guideline for people in their daily lives. First, refuse unnecessary items such as disposable spoons and chopsticks when ordering delivery food if you do not really need them. Second, reduce the amount of goods you buy in the first place and choose reusable items over disposable ones. Specifically, replace all single-use eating utensils and paper plates with reusable alternatives. Third, reuse items by washing and repairing them. Fourth, recycle properly and try to use upcycled products, which are new products made using by-products. Last but not least, there is ROT, which includes using biodegradable products such as vinyl made with corn husks and wet wipes made with 100% wood pulp. Now that we are experiencing climate change and extreme weather events, people are becoming aware that the issue of environmental protection can no longer be ignored. Responsible consumption and production that considers the environment were deemed good in the past, but they are now becoming absolute necessities. It is time for us to take responsibility for our common resources and do our duty for future generations. aprilkim404@kookmin.ac.kr","filter_flag":1}
