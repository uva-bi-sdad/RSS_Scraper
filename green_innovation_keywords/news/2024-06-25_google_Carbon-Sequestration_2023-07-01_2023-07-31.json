Oftentimes, these programs exclude no-tillers and cover croppers because they are already practicing regenerative agriculture. Locus AG recently hosted a digital demonstration, Get Confident in Carbon, with No-Till Farmer. Shane Head, director of customer success at Locus AG, and Mark Hill and Chris Lidgett, both directors of sales at the company, outlined details of the CarbonNOW program that pays farmers for sequestering carbon. Here are 5 key takeaways from their presentation. 1. Adding Locus AG Products Will Qualify Long-Term No-Tillers While many farmers who have been no-tilling and using cover crops for years don\u2019t qualify for most carbon credit programs, using Locus AG soil probiotics qualifies as an official practice change and makes longtime no-tillers eligible to enroll. \u201cThe product itself is the practice change or the qualifying additionality in the program,\u201d Lidgett says. \u201cFor many of you guys who have been long-term no tillers or long-term cover crop users, you get pushed aside in most programs, whereas we have an option for you to take advantage of our program and get some carbon sequestration payments as well.\u201d 2. Program Offers High ROI Despite being counted as a practice change, most no-tillers who enroll in the CarbonNOW program won\u2019t have to change much about their farming methods. In most cases, it\u2019s not necessary to buy new equipment or make drastic adjustments. Instead, the program involves adding new products to an already existing program. This leads to a high return on investment because the initial investment cost is minimal in the first place. The company also estimated that it has distributed more than $1 million in carbon payments to a total group of less than 50 farmers. 3. Guaranteed Payments The CarbonNOW program is set up to ensure $12 per acre with accruing performance bonuses based on annual free soil testing. \u201cYou get a guaranteed payment so you do not have to be as worried about how much carbon you\u2019re going to sequester year to year,\u201d Lidgett says. \u201cYou are going to get a guaranteed payment no matter what.\u201d While the guaranteed amount is a nice cushion to fall back on, Head says if the soil samples show that carbon was sequestered, the no-tiller will receive a performance bonus. 4. Third-Party Soil Sampling The program includes third-party soil sampling to ensure everything is accurate. Lidgett says that soil samples are one of the most essential aspects of carbon programs in general \u2014 being accurate in reporting data. \u201cWe want to strive to be at the highest level of that, so we have a program that not only helps you right away, it also has staying power in the industry for years to come,\u201d Lidgett says. Head says after the soil sampling is done, $9 of the total $12 gets paid out right away. The remaining $3 comes after harvest data collection. \u201cThird-party soil sampling is really a critical part of this,\u201d Head says. \u201cWe're using scientific methods to understand how much carbon is actually sequestered in your fields. We do this year over year in the same location control areas, meaning those areas would not have product put on them. We're continually checking our product against your soil to make sure it's working and validating those carbon credits.\u201d 5. Grower Data Portal Locus AG also implemented a grower data portal and specifically tailored it with farmers in mind. The portal is meant to be easy to use in an effort to not waste any of no-tillers\u2019 time. \u201cWith our newer addition to the data portal and platform, you're going to be able to go in there, see all your fields, all your maps and know what's going on within the program for you at pretty much any given time,\u201d Lidgett says. \u201cIt's a very simple program for growers to use in order to see what stage you are at in the carbon program and get the latest update.\u201d To learn more about the program or check your eligibility for enrollment visit the CarbonNOW website portal.

HYCO1 is a Houston, Texas (USA) based technology company that has created a disruptive CO 2 conversion catalyst and related low-cost CO 2 process technology. HYCO1 CUBE\u2122 Technology (Carbon Utilization, Best Efficiency) cost-effectively utilizes carbon dioxide and various methane source feedstocks to create low-cost, low-carbon chemical grade syngas in a single pass. The syngas produced is used to produce low carbon intensity (CI) downstream products. HYCO1 technology not only lowers the resultant carbon score of the downstream products by 50% to 100% but does so at a competitive cost compared to fossil feedstock derived products and without the requirement of incentives like many other technologies. HYCO1 technology enables green syngas to be used for making products such as Hydrogen, Synthetic Base Oils, Low-Carbon Jet Fuels, Green Methanol, and many others. The new HYCO1 project to be co-located with Kansas Ethanol will utilize all of their 800 tons per day of CO 2 to produce approximately 60 million gallons per year of low-carbon and zero-carbon products. Kurt Dieker, Chief Development Officer, and Co-founder of HYCO1, stated \"HYCO1 is excited to announce this innovative, next generation project and to collaborate with the Kansas Ethanol team, which runs one of the most advanced ethanol production facilities in the country. I have worked with the Kansas Ethanol team for the last fifteen years, including my tenure as Director of Technology Strategy at ICM, Inc., the world's largest ethanol technology provider.\" Dieker continued \"While there are many paths that an ethanol facility can take to improve sustainability and margins, ranging from additional energy efficiencies to protein separation, in my opinion CO 2 utilization represents the leading value-added step for an ethanol production facility.\" Lastly, \"As a native Kansan, I am especially proud to be able to build the first of many HYCO1 Carbon Negative, Planet Positive\u2122 facilities starting with this flagship project in Kansas.\" The Lyons HYCO1 project is in the engineering stage with plans to complete the pre-construction engineering in 2024. The facility will produce approximately 4,000 barrels per day of first-of-a-kind synthetic Base Lubricating Oils and Low-Carbon Jet Fuel made from CO 2 . High-performance products include four centistoke base oil for use in the highest grade synthetic motor oils; and a two centistoke base oil currently being tested by EV manufacturers for its ideal battery and drive-train heat transfer and lubrication properties. The projects' products are produced with more than 80% reductions in carbon footprints versus traditional fossil-derived products. Approximately half of the weight of these new sustainable products will consist of biogenic CO2 that would have previously been emitted into the atmosphere. Mike Chisam, CEO of Kansas Ethanol, said of the project, \"Although most ethanol producers are considering or pursuing underground carbon sequestration in our industry to decarbonize, we believe that carbon utilization, which supports a circular carbon economy, represents the best use of our CO 2, and positions us more competitively in the market. Value added products made from CO 2 that displace fossil derived products represents a win for us at Kansas Ethanol, a win for the U.S. Ethanol Sector, and a win for the global environment. We are looking forward to the construction of the HYCO1-based Green Carbon Synthetics Kansas, LLC facility next to ours. The co-location benefits: carbon dioxide utilization, natural gas offset through waste heat steam production, and additional electricity offsets will position our facility as a world leader of low-carbon ethanol resulting in significant shared savings.\" Chisam also noted \"HYCO1's carbon utilization technology enables us to sustainably produce all products, even if, or when, government support incentives are no longer available. That is incredibly important to us.\" HYCO1 is currently evaluating additional project sites and partners to mirror the Green Carbon Synthetics Kansas, LLC project, while also collaborating with downstream technology providers to produce other low-carbon products. About HYCO1: Founded by industrial gas, green chemical, and bio-fuels production experts in 2020, HYCO1 is a new carbon technology company based in Houston, Texas. HYCO1 CUBE\u2122 Technology is developed, tested, and ready to deploy commercially at full-scale. HYCO1 collaborates with industrial companies worldwide to help them become more sustainable. The technology utilizes a revolutionary catalyst and process design to convert industrial scale CO 2 emissions into low carbon intensity syngas and green chemicals. HYCO1's technology enables the use of third-party CO 2 as a feedstock to simultaneously lower the operational cost of industrial gas production while creating zero to negative emissions from the process. The innovative technology creates low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are used as chemical building blocks to create various downstream products, including Synthetic Base Oils used in lubricants, Low-Carbon Jet Fuel, Green Methanol, Ammonia, Urea, and others. About Kansas Ethanol: Located in Lyons, KS, Kansas Ethanol is an industry-leading, best-of-class 80 million gallon per year fuel and USP grade ethanol facility. The company began producing ethanol from its ICM-designed and constructed facility in 2008. Since then, Kansas Ethanol has been at the forefront of innovation and sustainability, diversifying its bio-feedstocks, revenue streams, and continuously reducing its carbon footprint.

The United Nations estimates that the number of wildfires worldwide will increase 50% by 2100 and warns that governments remain unprepared. Wildfire emissions contain small particles (PM2.5), ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and other pollutants that pose direct human health risks, such as asthma attacks and other respiratory ailments. Given the guidance to limit one\u2019s time outdoors during such events, buildings are a critical shield against pollution\u2019s adverse effects. Ensuring a well-sealed architectural envelope and using effective filters (like MERV 13 models) in HVAC equipment can help reduce wildfire smoke penetration in buildings. In addition to these strategies, advances in material technologies demonstrate how exterior and interior surfaces can play essential roles in mitigating air pollution. courtesy ECE For example, researchers at Germany\u2019s Rhine-Westphalian Technical University of Applied Sciences Aachen have developed a textile-based fa\u00e7ade system that improves air quality. Created in partnership with German real estate developer ECE, the air-purifying product is made of a fine mesh-polymer fabric derived from recycled PET bottles. The active ingredient is a photocatalytic coating that causes nitrogen oxides to bind to the surface in the presence of sunlight. The pollutants are then converted via oxidation into non-toxic salts, which wash off the self-cleaning surface during rain events. A test application of the anti-smog textile, which demonstrated a 55% reduction in airborne nitrogen oxides, was installed on an ECE office building in Hamburg in 2020. 3M offers another pollution-fighting surface in the form of a roofing application. The Minnesota company\u2019s Smog-reducing Granules, created by its Industrial Mineral Products Division in 2018, are photocatalytic particles used to coat roofing products like residential asphalt shingles. A test by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California revealed that 3M shingles composed of 5% Smog-reducing Granules and 95% conventional granules measurably reduced nitrogen oxide. According to 3M, one ton of these granules can mitigate the equivalent of a year\u2019s worth of smog generated by one vehicle traversing 3,000 miles. Other technologies absorb atmospheric carbon. Seville, Spain-based Graphenstone manufactures air-purifying paints that absorb carbon as they cure. As the lime-based paint dries, it reacts with carbon dioxide and forms calcium carbonate. While this conversion process is most pronounced during the initial curing, it continues throughout the life of the material. A test conducted on a paint application at a hospital in Ecuador revealed impressive results. \u201cBefore painting, the CO 2 value was three and a half times higher than the value reported after the paint application, going from 16,830 to 4,809 parts per million,\u201d the manufacturer explains. This significant reduction allowed the air quality to meet the pollution limit\u20145,000 parts per million\u2014established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Wallpaper is another product for the air-cleaning arsenal. Italy-based manufacturer Caos Creativo offers the Ecopur Air-Wall, a surface treatment that removes a variety of airborne pollutants, including smog particles as well as bacteria and other pathogens. The wallpaper utilizes ionizing resin that functions with or without ambient light, passively purifying the air and removing undesirable odors. The manufacturer explains that air should ideally have a concentration of 1,000 to 3,000 negative ions per cubic centimeter, the equivalent air quality of most exurban areas, and claims that the Ecopur Air-Wall results in a range of 2,000 to 4,000, comparable to \u201cmountain and forest air,\u201d according to its website. Living systems can also contribute to the pollution-mitigating cause. London-based ecoLogicStudio has developed a variety of bio-based installations that utilize living organisms such as microalgae to improve environmental quality. The firm\u2019s recent Habitat One project in Seoul, South Korea incorporates 40 algae photobioreactors, a biomass-harvesting photosynthetic reactor wall, and a multistory carbon-capturing tree sculpture. As a holistic system, Habitat One demonstrates how air purification, carbon sequestration, and biomass generation may be employed as interrelated strategies. \u201cImagining a carbon-neutral city implies the complete redefinition of all our production, construction and waste recycling processes,\u201d ecoLogicStudio co-founder Claudia Pasquero told Dezeen. Considering the increased occurrences of wildfires and other forms of atmospheric air pollution, buildings will serve as vital refuges. \u201cBuildings are a critical element for climate resiliency,\u201d claimed John Mandyck, CEO of New York\u2013based nonprofit Urban Green Council, in a Bloomberg interview. Airtightness and mechanical filtration are proven methods for ensuring buildings\u2019 effectiveness in this role, but material-based solutions also represent compelling enhancements for the air-purifying toolkit. Because most material solutions are passive in nature, they do not increase operational energy use and continue to function in the event of power outages. Given our future meteorological outlook, architects should consider combining mechanical and surface-based strategies to improve overall air quality.

(\"Replenish\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EarthRenew Inc. (CSE: ERTH) (OTCQB: VVIVF) (\"EarthRenew\" or the \"Company\"), is pleased to announce it has been selected to receive a $7 million grant from Emissions Reductions Alberta (ERA) as part of Alberta's Industrial Transformation Challenge. The ERA grant will support the construction of a new regenerative fertilizer manufacturing facility near Debolt, Alberta, and will support local Alberta construction and manufacturing jobs as well as reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions compared to the traditional fertilizer manufacturing process and lead to increased carbon sequestration properties in the soil through the use of regenerative fertilizers. As part of the ERA application process, an independent study on GHG emissions was conducted showing that over 22,000 tons of CO 2 e per year would be avoided based on the facility's contemplated production of 50,000 metric tons of regenerative fertilizer per year. Also contemplated under the ERA application was the creation of 200 cumulative construction jobs and 50 permanent and direct and indirect jobs as a result of the construction and ongoing operation of the Debolt facility. The Debolt facility will produce up to 50,000 metric tons of regenerative fertilizer per year. Commissioning of the Debolt facility is expected in late 2024 or early 2025. The ERA grant is not required to be repaid. Over the coming weeks, the Company will be submitting the required follow-up project documentation and debt financing to the ERA to finalize the funding late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2023. The finalization of the ERA grant is subject to typical financing conditions including due diligence and execution of formal agreements. Regenerative fertilizer is poised to be a game changer for agriculture producers across Canada and around the world by replacing traditional synthetic fertilizers, which are often high in harmful nitrous oxide and emissions-intensive to produce. Replenish's low-salt alternative, pioneered and patented by the company is manufactured with zero waste, using recycled organic matter such as mushroom waste and elemental mineral sources providing solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing producers. The result is a fertilizer that increases microbial activity, restores the nutrient balance of the soil, fewer emissions, higher yields, and reduced input costs for farmers at a time when those costs have been skyrocketing. As stated by CEO Neil Wiens: \"We believe Replenish's unique and patented regenerative fertilizer products will put Alberta in a leadership position in the Agriculture sector with regards to reducing GHG emissions from fertilizer manufacturing while also contributing to improved carbon sequestration properties in the soil and allowing growers to maximize their soil and plant health and vitality. According to the Government of Canada1, agriculture activities accounted for approximately 7% of Canada's overall GHG emissions while the Environmental Protection Agency2 in the Unites States estimates agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for approximately 24% of global GHG emissions. We believe our products will play a key role in the sustainability of the agriculture sector in Alberta and beyond and we'd like to thank the ERA for placing their trust and confidence in our Company's ability to deliver a win-win solution for the environment and farmer economics.\" 1 https:\/\/agriculture.canada.ca\/en\/agricultural-production\/agricultural-greenhouse-gas-indicator 2 https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ghgemissions\/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data About Replenish Nutrients Replenish Nutrients is an Agricultural Biotechnology company and a leading intellectual property developer of regenerative fertilizer solutions and sustainable manufacturing processes to support a farm system that puts healthy soils and grower profitability back on the table.
