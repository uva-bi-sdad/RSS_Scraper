Since then, in addition to overseeing this intriguing operation, which processes more than 50 tons of recyclable material an hour, Antonacci and Jonathan Murray, director of Operations for Murphy Road Recycling, have been leading individuals and groups through the massive facility to show them what goes on there and why this operation is among the most advanced of its kind in the country \u2014 and the world, for that matter. And there have been many different constituencies donning the bright orange vests, hardhats, and audio systems needed to hear and be heard over the din of countless conveyer belts and sorting machinery. These include elected officials, business leaders, public-works crews, press members (including BusinessWest), and, perhaps most importantly, representatives of the companies that buy the recyclables \u2014 and many of them have made the trip to Berlin. What they take in is a facility that was built with three primary goals in mind: to increase the quantity, quality, and purity of recyclables; to provide an innovative and safe working environment; and to have the flexibility to adapt to ever-evolving consumer habits (more on that later) and recycling market conditions. And more than a year after it opened to considerable fanfare, this MRF is accomplishing all three, especially with regard to the purity of recyclables, said both Antonacci and Murray, noting that this is something that communities, states, and those buying the recovered products are demanding. \u201cToday\u2019s curbside material isn\u2019t what it was 10 or 15 years ago. Then, it was heavy on newspaper and relatively clean. Today, everyone reads news online and orders everything from the internet. Today\u2019s stream is full of small cardboard boxes and shipping envelopes and requires that we, as recyclers, innovate and change our thinking around the sorting of recyclables.\u201d The fully integrated system, replete with artificial intelligence and high-tech scanners, is dedicated to the maximum recovery of all recyclable material, with several second-chance mechanisms in place to make sure valuable material doesn\u2019t slip through the cracks, said Murray, adding that the design includes state-of-the-art equipment to target paper, cardboard, boxboard, glass, and five types of plastic. Elaborating, he said the system first separates paper from aluminum and other metals and plastic and then digs deeper to identify and sort different types of plastic, such as the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) used to make water and soda bottles, and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) used to make food and beverage containers, shampoo bottles, cleaning-product bottles, and similar products. \u201cThe optical scanners are trained; they\u2019re learning all the time to know what the makeup of a PET bottle is,\u201d Murray explained. \u201cIf a scanner\u2019s job is to pick PET bottles, it knows it by reading the makeup of the bottle. Everything else travels on to the next optical scanner, which may be looking for HDPE or milk jugs or laundry detergent bottles; it scans for those and shoots those out. \u201cThe scanners are actually looking for the makeup of what\u2019s in that material,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt shoots a blast of air to kick it out or leave it in, and they\u2019re trained at the factory and adjusted, so if we\u2019re seeing a higher level of PET in the mix than HDPE, we can make adjustments so it will recognize that quicker and make sure we\u2019re getting it all out.\u201d For this issue, BusinessWest toured the massive facility in Berlin and talked with Antonacci and Murphy about this operation, the evolving recycling market, and how the Berlin MRF redefines what would be considered state-of-the-art in this industry. Leaving Little to Waste Murray calls it the \u201cAmazon effect.\u201d That\u2019s a term he and others in this industry use to describe the influence of that giant corporation on life in general \u2014 and especially the world, and business, of recycling. \u201cToday\u2019s curbside material isn\u2019t what it was 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he noted. \u201cThen, it was heavy on newspaper and relatively clean. Today, everyone reads news online and orders everything from the internet. Today\u2019s stream is full of small cardboard boxes and shipping envelopes and requires that we, as recyclers, innovate and change our thinking around the sorting of recyclables.\u201d And these sentiments effectively and concisely explain what the All American Material Recovery Facility is all about \u2014 innovation and changing how people think about recycling and waste-disposal diversion. \u201cWe took a significant amount of risk and leveraged our expertise, as well as a very strong team, to develop what we have here.\u201d The facility, and the roughly $40 million invested in it, represent another entrepreneurial venture, and gambit, undertaken by the Antonacci family, which was recognized by BusinessWest as its Top Entrepreneurs in 2018 for their creation of an eclectic and highly successful stable of businesses, with \u2018stable\u2019 being one of the operative words. Indeed, this large and impressive portfolio includes a horse farm, Lindy Farm in Somers, which has bred and trained a string of champion trotters; Sonny\u2019s Place in Somers (named after the patriarch of the family, Frank\u2019s grandfather, Guy \u2018Sonny\u2019 Antonacci), a huge and continually growing family-entertainment venue; GreatHorse, the high-end, horseracing-themed private golf club created on the site of the former Hampden Country Club; and Murphy Road Recycling. All of these ventures represented considerable investments and risks, Antonacci said, adding that the MRF in Berlin is no different. \u201cYou\u2019ll see many of the same themes throughout this facility as you would at our other operations,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe took a significant amount of risk and leveraged our expertise, as well as a very strong team, to develop what we have here.\u201d The company looked at a number of recycling facilities starting in 2018 and made the decision to buy the Berlin facility in 2020, at the height of COVID. \u201cIt was a considerable risk and investment at that point,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut we knew that there would be life after COVID, and we believed that the region really needed a reliable, scalable solution to handling the growing amount of single-stream material.\u201d By single-stream, he noted that recyclables from businesses and consumers come with various materials mixed together, often with materials that shouldn\u2019t be placed in recycling bins but are anyway \u2014 from batteries to electronic devices. This venture represents the expansion and modernization of an existing recycling facility, Antonacci said, adding that everything about the facility is state-of-the-art, a phrase he used early and often in this conversation, because it\u2019s certainly warranted. \u201cWe integrated tried-and-true mechanical separation though screens with optical technology,\u201d he noted as he talked about what is really the heart of this operation. \u201cWe have machines that are optically looking at the material to polish any contamination or any mixture of different grades of recycling, and that\u2019s done through highly advanced camera systems with artificial intelligence.\u201d Reading Material The facility handles recyclables from roughly 100 communities in Connecticut and Western Mass., Antonacci explained, noting that materials from many communities in the 413 are aggregated and then brought to Berlin for processing. Overall, it handles upwards of 1,000 tons of material per day, a huge jump from the 350 tons a day handled by the largest facilities in the area prior to the opening of the MRF in Berlin. Beyond size and scope, this facility stands out for many other reasons. Indeed, the operation employs a dozen optical scanners that can identify and separate materials based on their chemical composition, and utilizes robotics and AI to perform additional quality control. \u201cThe quality of the material that we\u2019re able to glean from the blue-bin mix is really remarkable,\u201d Antonacci said. \u201cLeveraging our expertise and that of Van Dyk Recycling Solutions, we\u2019ve moved the industry forward a generation with the design of this plant, based not only on the scale, but on the quality of the materials coming out of here.\u201d As they were developing the Berlin facility, those at Murphy Road toured a number of recycling operations in this region and other parts of the country, Murray said, with an eye toward adopting best practices and technologies. But there are some things being done here that would be considered unique and groundbreaking, he went on. This includes a dual-feed system set in parallel lines, Antonacci said, adding that this is a different approach to preparing materials for final processing. Other innovations include the picking stations, where employees handle quality control, which are enclosed in dust-controlled, climate-controlled boxes which place a premium on worker comfort and safety. \u201cWe went through a painstaking effort of keeping people away from places that could harm them,\u201d he told BusinessWest. \u201cWe invested heavily in automation to further increase the safety and productivity of the facility.\u201d Beyond these safety features, the facility was designed to effectively handle ongoing evolution in consumer habits and thus the recycling stream. As he talked about this and pointed to the streams of paper moving along conveyer belts, Murray noted that, despite declines in readership, a large amount of newsprint still winds up in recycling bins. \u201cWe took a significant amount of risk and leveraged our expertise, as well as a very strong team, to develop what we have here.\u201d But these same bins are being increasingly dominated by both cardboard packaging \u2014 that aforementioned \u2018Amazon effect\u2019 \u2014 as well as myriad kinds of plastic, aluminum, and tin cans. Overall, the bins are cleaner than they were years ago, he went on, adding that the overall quality of the end product \u2014 what is ultimately sold to companies to make new products \u2014 is a function of how effectively the different materials, especially the many types of plastics, are separated. And this is where the All American MRF stands out from other facilities. Elaborating, Antonacci said this facility\u2019s sorting capabilities extend to polypropylene, used to make everything from yogurt containers to margarine tubs; from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee cups to the packaging for to-go food products. \u201cThis is something that has historically been hard to separate,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut we have both the optical technology to look for polypropylene number 5, which those containers are made out of, and there\u2019s also a laser on our optical machine that enables us to see those black plastics \u2014 the to-go containers \u2014 which most facilities can\u2019t.\u201d Bottom Line There are ever-larger amounts of polypropylene #5 winding up recycling bins, and the ability to separate it from everything else is becoming increasingly important, said Antonacci, adding that this is just one of the reasons why he and Murray are giving so many tours these days. People want to see what separates this facility from most others \u2014 with the emphasis on separates. It not only represents state-of-the-art in this industry, it defines it.","filter_flag":1}

But long before tires are thrown away, they leave behind a trail of environmental harm stretching from tropical forests, along supply chains, and to consumers. Limited rubber traceability risks deforestation, experts warn, while other research shows that tire wear releases potentially toxic microplastic pollution. It needn\u2019t be this way: Circular economy solutions \u2014 reducing, reusing and recycling materials in closed loops \u2014 could offer tire pollution solutions. However, these solutions come with limitations and trade-offs. A tire redesign is greatly needed to increase longevity, as is the cultivation of new sources of deforestation-free rubber, and alternative end-of-life strategies that emphasis recycling of the dozens of components found in tires. But given the complex makeup of today\u2019s tires, there won\u2019t be one simple solution. Imagine a heap of a billion vehicle tires towering overhead, the total number humanity throws away in just one year \u2014 worn-out tires tossed into landfills, burned, or littering the landscape. While that\u2019s a visually distressing image, the harm tires do starts where they\u2019re sourced, with current and future car fleets leaving an environmental trail stretching from tropical rainforests to rubber plantations to global roadsides, along waterways, and even into the atmosphere \u2014 impacting global biodiversity and human health. Experts say that applying a circular economy model to tire production and disposal could limit massive resource demand, while simultaneously turning this globally vexing waste stream back into valuable materials. But no matter the solution, the complex composition of the average tire \u2014 containing more than 400 chemicals and compounds \u2014 means there\u2019s no single silver-bullet solution to this persistent problem. A toxic conundrum Tires typically start their life\u2019s journey in the tropics, with rubber produced predominantly by smallholder farmers on monocrop plantations. Current production methods risk ongoing deforestation and harm to biodiversity, along with uncertain livelihoods for farmers. Some 70% of the world\u2019s natural rubber ends up in car tires with most coming from tropical countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. But natural rubber is just one component found in a modern tire. Like the cars they\u2019re fitted to, tires are composite products, made of steel and hundreds of chemicals and compounds that give them durability and strength. Unpacking tire environmental impacts is complicated, say experts, partly due to that complexity, and also due to the lack of publicly available data on tire ingredients. What is known is that tire impacts are spread far and wide: Rolling on roads wears them down, releasing microplastic particulates everywhere \u2014 making them one of the most common pollutants in Earth\u2019s oceans today, according to research. \u201cWe know enough to say that it is possibly the biggest, and possibly the least well understood, environmental problem related to transportation,\u201d says Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a company that conducts research into tire wear. Some tire waste kills. A tire additive known as 6PPD, for example, has been identified as particularly alarming. The mass die-off of coho salmon in the U.S. Pacific Northwest has been linked to tire wear via chemical pollution in the form of this antioxidant. As it protects tires, 6PPD transforms into 6PPD-quinone, a highly toxic chemical. Edward Kolodziej, who led the team that made the discovery and a researcher at the University of Washington Tacoma, describes 6PPD-quinone as possibly one of the most toxic substances known to aquatic species. Since its discovery, researchers have found 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone in fresh- and saltwater, ocean sediments, air, soil, and human urine; yet its overall ecological and health impacts remain unknown. Many other tire chemicals lack sufficient study as to risk. Chemical-laden tires at the end of their life pose a serious waste management headache. Landfilling them is no solution; no matter where they\u2019re dumped, heaps of aging tires become a pollution source as they break down, leaching toxins into soils and aquifers. Burning tires, another common practice, merely transfers that toxic burden from soils and waters to the sky. Research shows that open burning can emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and other compounds at potentially harmful levels, posing a risk to human health. Circling the tire economy At its core, the circular economy seeks to reduce, reuse and recycle materials in closed loops, with zero waste as the ultimate goal. Tires are prime circularity candidates, say analysts, because when discarded they retain a wealth of useful materials. But getting at those materials, processing them, and making a profit doing so is a major challenge. \u201cSuccessful ELT [end-of-life tire] management systems \u2026 foster circular flows of materials \u2026 and avoid the unregulated dumping of tires,\u201d says Gavin Whitmore, senior communications manager at the Tire Industry Project (TIP), a group that includes some of the world\u2019s major tire manufacturers. But ELT recovery is woefully inadequate today. A 2019 TIP report noted that in 45 countries surveyed, just 42% of end-of-life tires were used in material recovery and 15% in energy recovery. Some common management options include shredding tires into small rubber pellets for use as construction filler, in rubber-modified asphalt, or in artificial sports pitches. Millions of waste tires become alternative energy, dubbed tire-derived fuel, burned in kilns for the production of cement, steel, pulp and paper. This market is only set to grow in coming years, say analysts, due to its low cost and reported reduced carbon emissions. Some argue that tire-derived fuel could even lessen the heavy environmental footprint of the cement and paper industries, while helping dispose of tire waste. TIP notes that \u201cenergy recovery can be a particularly efficient way to deal with high volumes of ELT and eliminate long-standing stockpiles because it is generally technically straightforward to implement\u201d while \u201cthe use of ELT as an alternative fuel is also encouraged to reduce CO 2 emissions.\u201d But some experts argue that these common disposal routes \u2014 grinding down tires or burning them \u2014 amount to little more than downcycling, failing to maximize the full potential for material reuse of waste tires. Not surprisingly, some of these trumpeted solutions are also plagued by their own environmental issues. Researchers in Ireland, for example, found that the spreading of rubber crumb on artificial sports pitches is a source of microplastics and may pose health concerns due to the toxic chemicals locked up in the materials. The European Union is aiming to ban this widespread practice, potentially leaving a backlog of tires to be disposed of properly. Making old tires new again: Reusing and recycling Two other solutions tipped to deal with tire waste on a large scale offer the promise of circularity: devulcanization and pyrolysis, both of which could ultimately make new tires out of old, according to analysts. \u201cThe most important part of the circular economy for tires is getting the original product back into its intended application,\u201d says Jon Visaisouk, chief operating officer of Tyromer. His company produces devulcanized rubber from used tires, which can replace some raw materials in new tire production. Currently, the firm can process between 100,000 and 150,000 waste tires per year, he says. Devulcanization is a promising low-energy solution for dealing with tires en masse, but has its limitations from a circularity perspective, according to Niles Beadman, a patent attorney with Mewburn Ellis: \u201cYou can\u2019t use that devulcanized product as 100% raw material. You would still typically mix it in with some virgin raw material,\u201d he explains, claiming that pyrolysis shows more promise. Pyrolysis works by heating tires in the absence of air to break them down. This turns waste tires into separate reusable materials such as recovered carbon black for new tires, oils that can be upgraded to alternatives to diesel, and gases to loop back in and power the whole system, reducing its energy intensity. Prior to the pyrolysis process, the tire\u2019s steel is stripped for reuse. Pyrolysis is often referred to by advocates as \u201cenvironmentally safe\u201d and a vital tire waste solution. \u201cWhat we\u2019re bringing to the table is a solution that is not only environmentally friendly, but can work at scale to actually make a dent in the problem,\u201d says Vianney Vales, CEO of Wastefront in Norway, which uses pyrolysis. But to break tires down into those useful products, the energy-intensive pyrolysis process creates multiple waste streams, is linked to significant air and water pollution, and produces carbon emissions. Pakistan banned the use of pyrolysis units last year due to toxic pollution concerns. One frequent problem with pyrolysis is the quality of products made by the process, says Dina Czajczy\u0144ska, a researcher at Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology in Poland. Another \u201creally important environmental issue\u201d is highly toxic sulfur emissions \u2014 meaning that, without desulfurization of emissions and of the products themselves, pyrolysis can be environmentally harmful, she says. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is solve this [tire] problem without having an impact on the environment around us,\u201d says Thomas S\u00f6rensson, CEO of Scandinavian Enviro Systems, a Sweden-based company that employs pyrolysis. \u201cWe use the latest technology for reducing emissions, taking care of sulfur, and have put in place a system that is meeting the highest environmental regulations.\u201d Practiced conscientiously, pyrolysis may have the potential to convert massive amounts of tires into renewable products, say some experts. A Wastefront facility under construction in northern England could absorb about 20% of the U.K.\u2019s annual waste tire output once it goes live in 2024, according to Vales. But as other experts underscore, the environmental footprint of widespread pyrolysis use as a tire solution could be large if not appropriately managed and regulated. \u201cThis is going to be a crucial part of the circular economy for cars and plastics more generally. How can we extract value and recycle these millions of waste tires?\u201d asks Molden, who notes that while pyrolysis offers a \u201cmajor opportunity\u201d for tire recycling, \u201cyou have to [power] it with green energy, and you have to make sure you don\u2019t create all sorts of toxic waste that has to be dumped somewhere in the process.\u201d Circular rubber sources Dealing with mountains of end-of-life tires is only part of the sustainability challenge facing the tire industry and the automotive sector at large. A recent report by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) underlines the lack of transparency in rubber supply chains, risking unseen links to deforestation and wider biodiversity harm. Given that the projected demand for tires is set to increase year-on-year, unabated by the switch to electric vehicles, more rubber will be required, which may put tropical forests deeper in harm\u2019s way. To this end, tire manufacturers are investigating alternative natural rubbers, such as Russian dandelion, from which limited quantities of tires are already made. These innovative sources could serve as substitutes to tropically-sourced rubber. \u201cThe major problem that we\u2019re facing is higher demand for natural rubber in the next few years,\u201d says Dirk Pr\u00fcfer, a professor of plant biotechnology at the University of M\u00fcnster in Germany whose work focuses on producing rubber from Russian dandelion. He says alternative rubbers could supply at least some of future demand, without endangering biodiversity-rich areas and tropical forests. The Russian dandelion, for example, can grow on so-called marginal lands, and doesn\u2019t compete with food crops, he says. However, ZSL sustainable business specialist Sam Ginger says he doubts the efficacy of this solution. \u201cIt would be a big distraction to try and start establishing huge plantations of dandelion without solving the [sustainability] issues that [already exist] within the rubber supply chain,\u201d he says. That new source would distract from the problems faced by the \u201c6 million smallholder farmers that are currently dependent on this industry.\u201d Experts also underline the need for increased regenerative agricultural practices if supply chain circularity is to be achieved. Ginger says the natural rubber industry already offers multiple opportunities in this space, working with farmers to put regenerative and agroforestry practices in place to support both biodiversity and farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Stefano Savi, director of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber, says that fundamentally \u201cwe need to change the [tire production] system so that the farmers become entrepreneurs.\u201d \u201cToday, most of the farmers are extractors of these commodities and deplete natural resources because they\u2019re not geared towards [sustainably] managing the land,\u201d he notes. Like Ginger, he says that by helping smallholders apply circular principles, including pesticide reduction and better water management, then \u201cyou will be able to do more with less. You will be able to have a better system.\u201d But such changes are all predicated on fully tracing and creating transparency in supply chains, and will require wider collaborations from industries such as car manufacturers. Ginger adds: \u201cTo make a truly transformative effort across the whole supply chain, you need to have carmakers involved. They need to be contributing funds to any sort of sustainability effort across the whole supply chain, all the way down to the smallholders.\u201d Achieving circularity and \u2018using less cars\u2019 Tires are just one component of the wider circularity challenges facing the auto industry. But tires represent a fast-growing, thorny problem, as vehicle use worldwide increases material demand. Tire wear, too, is predicted to get worse as EVs become more prevalent, in part due to their bulkier weight, likely exacerbating associated microplastic and chemical pollution from problematic tire components. Solutions are urgently needed now, researchers say. Kolodziej especially emphasizes the need to find a safe alternative to 6PPD, which should be a priority for the industry. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of discussion around what should be evaluated in that chemical screening process to develop the circular economy\u201d in order to \u201creuse, remanufacture and recycle things like tires.\u201d But not all experts are convinced that a materially focused vision of circularity, and particularly recycling, will be enough to reduce tire-associated environmental problems. Czajczy\u0144ska, for example, emphasizes the need to reduce overall consumption: \u201cWe have to think about using less cars, using more bicycles and public transportation to avoid the problem of [tire] waste,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause no matter how well you process or treat waste tires, [they] will always produce some emissions or another waste product.\u201d Kaustubh Thapa, a researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, agrees that a \u201cbetter solution\u201d would be to offer alternatives that reduce the need for ever more tire production now and in the future. \u201cI think that when the circular economy is very technocratic and material-focused, it just shifts some problems to other parts,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we want to fix these challenges in a systematic way, then we need to also include the social dimension in the circular economy.\u201d Banner image: Increasing tire longevity, repairing and reusing component parts, are all tire circular solutions. A plant in Spain, operated by Life for Tyres Group and funded by the European Union, aims to recover materials (such as carbon black) and produce synthetic fuels (including biogas) from 26 million metric tons of end-of-life tires each year, equivalent to around 9% of Spain\u2019s annual use.

The plant will be built at Fletcher Building\u2019s Laminex site in Taupo, in the center of the North Island. The capital costs are estimated at $275 million. The new plant will include Dieffenbacher\u2019s new Belt Dryer. Along with digitalization, advanced plant engineering and operational excellence, sustainability is one of the four pillars of Dieffenbacher\u2019s smart plant concept CEBRO. The Belt Dryer has a low thermal energy consumption. It works at lower temperatures than drum dryers and can use low-calorific energy from the waste heat of other plant components that would otherwise remain unused. Furthermore, it can be used in combination with cogeneration. Image: Grey and translucent blue indicates new plant and equipment to be built beside existing end-of-life plant which will be decommissioned on completion \/ Fletcher Building Limited \u201cIt\u2019s only a small part of our new plant, but the Belt Dryer is a perfect example of Dieffenbacher\u2019s advanced solutions,\u201d says Paul Thorn, Fletcher Wood Products, Capital Works Manager at Fletcher Building. \u201cWe chose Dieffenbacher for this important project because we are assured that they will help us move our business forward.\u201d Fletcher Building\u2019s new CEBRO plant will have the flexibility to produce Fine OSB and conventional OSB. Fine OSB is a special type of board consisting of an OSB core layer covered top and bottom by layers of particleboard. It combines OSB\u2019s excellent mechanical properties with the surface quality of particleboard. Besides the new Belt Dryer, Dieffenbacher will supply an energy plant, a debarking line, purchased material infeed, strand production, a MAIER Impact Mill, the screening and air grading, material recovery, glue preparation, glue dosing and gluing systems, the forming station and forming line, a CPS+ continuous press with Press Emission Control System, raw board handling, pneumatic systems, electrics and automation, the digitalization solution EVORIS and the digital service platform MyDieffenbacher. In addition, Dieffenbacher subsidiary B. Maier Zerkleinerungstechnik GmbH is responsible for engineering the entire wood yard up to the strander. The new CEBRO plant will replace a particleboard production line featuring an almost 50-year-old single-opening press supplied by Dieffenbacher to Fletcher Building in 1974. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that our old press served us so well and for so long. With the right maintenance, we believe our new Dieffenbacher plant will last at least as long,\u201d says Thorn. Construction in Taupo will begin in early 2024. Start-up is scheduled for the fourth quarter of the same year, and full-scale production by mid-2025. After a ramp-up period, company expects to generate mid-cycle EBIT of approximately $40 million and return on funds employed (ROFE) at or above 15%.","filter_flag":1}
