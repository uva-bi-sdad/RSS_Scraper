Turbines are in Lincoln, Torrance and San Miguel counties and will connect to western markets via the in progress SunZia Transmission line, traveling 550 miles into Arizona with a capacity of 525 kilovolts. More:More New Mexico land must be saved from oil and gas to prevent climate crisis, study says The producer said it signed long-term power purchase agreements with Shell Energy North America and with the regents of the University of California for a portion of the energy generated by the facility. It\u2019s part of Shell\u2019s recent agenda of increasing its renewable power output, after the company last year launched its Shell Energy residential power brand in the U.S., offering 100 percent renewable energy plans to customers in Texas, initially. The efforts mark a transition for the British multinational oil major, which drills for shale oil and gas in Canada and Argentina in the Americas, having sold its Permian Basin assets in 2021 to ConocoPhillips.

It was here almost 50 years ago, after the 1973 oil embargo cut energy supplies to much of the West, that inventors and machinists began comparing notes about ways to harness the wind that sweeps across this flat expanse separating the North Sea from the islands that form the rest of Denmark. And while countless people have played a role in refining the machines that stud coastlines, plains and mountain ridges, perhaps no one has had more influence than a Jutlander named Henrik Stiesdal. As a young man of 21, he built a rudimentary machine to generate electricity for his parents\u2019 farm. He was later co-designer of an innovative three-bladed turbine that set the stage for what has become a multibillion-dollar global industry.

Suddenly faced with a lack of clean water, people everywhere fired up their stoves to boil water. Power failures are not surprising anymore. There was a similar grid failure in Houston in 2021 where 4.5 million people were impacted by water, power, heat and food shortages and more than 240 died. Power failures are common. Not just a concern for Texans, power grids across the globe are stressed and unreliable. For many, thoughts about clean water and reliable power lead to other concerns. The unfortunate combination of unreliable power sources and unpredictable weather, including storms, droughts, floods, wildfires and other climate disruptions, keep utility managers, engineers and first responders up at night. They all lead to water shortages, contaminated water and colossal water infrastructure failures. It is possible to make great strides in creating programs that address all these problems at the same time. Here is one solution that serves multiple functions. IMAGE 1: Energy recovery dashboard The solution stands at the nexus of water and energy in a system that provides a reliable supply of safe, clean drinking water while being more efficient, productive and sustainable. Saving water, decarbonizing, minimizing disruption and generating money to reinvest and upgrade infrastructure can now be done with a simple installation that could be funded largely by the government. Water is power\u2014consuming energy and creating it at the same time. The process of pumping, treating and distributing America\u2019s water and wastewater accounts for 6% of the nation\u2019s energy consumption, contributing 5% of its carbon emissions and 40% of a utility\u2019s budget. All this energy is consumed to power pumps, treat water and distribute the water to users. As electricity costs rise, the cost of these processes weighs heavily on the industry and its users. Even when water providers initiate conservation efforts, failing infrastructure limits their effectiveness. The United States loses 17% of its treated water, called nonrevenue water (NRW), to fractured distribution systems. The World Bank estimates broken distribution lines release 8.6 trillion gallons of NRW annually. Global water distribution systems highlight the interconnected nature of energy and water resources. The industry term used to describe this interconnectivity is the nexus of water and energy. Water distribution networks rely on fossil fuel-rich grid power to operate, and they directly contribute to water scarcity because of the unnecessary carbon they add to the atmosphere in the process of treating, pumping and delivering water to their users. There is innovation happening in the water and wastewater sectors. In recent years, academics, entrepreneurs and water innovators have worked together to address some of the most pressing challenges for the industry. Managing Water Loss & Reducing Carbon Footprint As energy costs rise, climate change and water loss increasingly impacts water and wastewater systems. Energy recovery that integrates control valves with micro-hydro technology enables water distribution itself to be the solution for each of these enormous challenges. Recent advances in micro-hydro turbine technology empowers water innovators to leverage the wasted pressure emitted by control valves. By leveraging existing flow and pressure differentials, this solution recaptures wasted energy from pressurized pipelines to return remarkable amounts of electricity to the local grid. This generated electricity can be used to save money that can be reinvested into operations, save water and reduce carbon emissions. It also provides what the industry needs most as it modernizes: real-time data about flow and pressure that is essential to water loss control. Now, water providers can analyze pressure data to identify problems within specific distribution zones (district metered areas) before they experience leaks and main breaks. It is an early warning system for operators. There are an estimated 2 million control valves in the U.S. and 5.7 million globally. Deploying in-conduit micro-hydroelectric energy recovery systems in the U.S. would offset 290 million metric tons of CO 2 annually in the U.S. and 1.75 gigatons worldwide. Federal Government to the Rescue There is some good news. For U.S. water utilities focusing on decarbonizing, federal funding is available. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) all have funds available that benefit cities and water utilities. Funding from programs like the Inflation Reduction Act now includes a direct pay option for tax-exempt entities. As a result, utilities can now provide funding for water loss programs and pay for it all through federal funding when combined with energy generation from energy recovery systems. Operational Results Energy generation products are proven technology. Across the U.S., in-conduit micro-hydroelectric generation plants are already producing renewable energy, alleviating energy costs and tracking distribution flow and pressure data. Simply replacing traditional pressure regulating valves or control valves with energy recovery systems provide these entities the necessary controls with the added features of energy production and pressure zone data to detect faulty distribution lines. Hillsboro Public Utility District (PUD) serves 112,000 residents outside of Portland, Oregon. The district serves the city of Hillsboro, which set a sustainability goal to reduce the city\u2019s square foot energy consumption by 60%. Taking this goal seriously, the district paired with an energy supplier to install an energy recovery system at one of their pressure reduction facilities. This project has been up and running without incident since July 2020. It generates 200,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year and yields a million dollars\u2019 worth of savings over the project life. It also eliminates more than 1,700 tons of carbon, providing hydraulic data, energy production and carbon reduction data in real time to track operations, NRW and sustainability goals. In Mount Vernon, Washington, the Skagit PUD installed an energy recovery system at its Division Street Pump Station where it manages water pressure and control flow in one facility. With the system, the station now converts excess pressure into renewable energy to offset expensive, fossil fuel rich electricity from the pumping load at this facility. This project has been up and running for more than 18 months without incident. A second project is being planned to power an electric vehicle charging station at a local high school, all from the otherwise wasted pressure in the distribution of water.

Because the blades are designed to be so durable, the materials used to build them can\u2019t currently be recycled. And about 43 million tons of these blades will be decommissioned by 2050. The new work describes a way to recover the main components of wind turbine blades, breaking down the plastic that holds them together without destroying the material\u2019s primary building blocks. \u201cWe need sustainable energy, but we also have to consider the waste, and we have to find solutions for that,\u201d says Alexander Ahrens, a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and the lead author of the new study. Wind turbine blades are made with strong plastic called epoxy resin. Because of the chemical bonds created when epoxy resin solidifies, it can\u2019t be melted and squished into a new shape to be reused, like the plastic that makes up water bottles or milk jugs. In this case, fibers are also mixed into the resin for extra strength. This kind of reinforced material\u2014called fiberglass when the supporting fibers are made using glass\u2014is often used for high-intensity applications like airplane wings and boats. \u201cBecause these materials are so durable, there\u2019s not really right now a technology that is fit for recycling them,\u201d Ahrens says. Some methods do exist for breaking down fiberglass, but these approaches usually render the epoxy portion unusable and often damage the glass fibers as well. The researchers at Aarhus set out to develop a method gentle enough to let the main components be used again. The resulting approach takes aim at chemical bonds that lock the plastic into place and \u201cchews them up like Pac-Man\u2014just chews up the epoxy and liberates those glass fibers,\u201d says Troels Skrydstrup, a professor of chemistry at Aarhus and another author of the new study. To break down the epoxy materials, researchers submerged them in a mixture of solvents and added a catalyst, which helped accelerate the chemical reaction. They heated everything up to 160 \u00b0C (320 \u00b0F) for between 16 hours and several days, until the target material was fully broken down.","filter_flag":1}

One day a student hurried into the large lecture hall and dropped the empty can for his morning caffeinated sugar buzz into the trash. Dr. Miller began that day's lecture by asking the student: \"Do you know how many joules it takes to extract the aluminum from bauxite ore for one soda can?\" He answered his own question, then extrapolated the number of aluminum cans manufactured, filled, distributed, and recycled per year in the United States, and compared the energy needed for bauxite ore versus recycled aluminum. These and similar lectures about the use of hair dryers, running tap water while brushing your teeth, and many more, instilled in me a sense of responsibility to our planet, and a desire to understand the connections and consequences between our actions and the ecosystems we live in. At the same time, I love cars, especially performance cars that are fun to drive. There's also the important role personal mobility serves in economies around the world, and our daily lives. It's the combination of these seemingly disparate values that attracted me to Honda from a young age and has fueled my career here for the last two and a half decades. Honda recently took three big steps within a single week in North America that illustrate our commitment to achieving our global goal of carbon neutrality \u2013 net zero emissions \u2013 for all products and corporate activities by 2050: We broke ground for our new joint venture EV battery plant in Ohio with LG Energy Solution. The batteries from this plant will power future EVs we make in North America. We announced a basic agreement with U.S.-based Ascend Elements, Inc., to collaborate toward our goal of achieving a stable supply of recycled lithium-ion battery materials necessary for our future EVs in North America. And we began demonstration operation of a stationary fuel cell power station at our headquarters in California that provides zero emission backup power. The Limitless Potential of Zero Today our industry is focused on electrification, and Honda has announced our clear vision to have 100% of new Honda and Acura vehicle sales to be battery-electric or fuel cell electric by 2040. The EV Hub we're establishing in Ohio will lead the way to our electrified future. However, to achieve carbon neutrality as a company will take more than electrifying our products. We will deliver our carbon neutral commitment through our Triple Action to Zero approach. Every End Creates a New Beginning Our Triple Action to Zero approach is critical to our effort to have zero environmental impact. The concept is simple: by using clean energy, along with reusing and recycling all of the materials in a product we make, we will no longer have to dig holes in the ground for finite materials and energy sources or bury spent materials in a hole in the ground at the end of their usable life. That doesn't change the values that go into our products \u2013 clean, safe, and fun vehicles that are high quality and of good value. We create vehicles for our customers to enjoy and to find new value in them for as long as possible. Even after a vehicle is purchased, by Honda and our dealers maintaining a relationship with successive customers and the vehicle, we aim to reclaim the product at end of life. This will enable us to recycle or reuse every bit of the materials from our vehicles, reprocess them back to raw materials and reuse those materials in the creation of new products. In short, to make a new Honda vehicle out of old Honda vehicles. Collaborating with Ascend Elements, POSCO, and other resource recycling businesses is one way we intend to reuse finite materials, toward achieving a consistent supply of recycled nickel, cobalt, and lithium to utilize in our EV battery supply chain from and for vehicles we will make in North America. When we have enough BEVs in circulation, we should be able to create such a closed-loop recycling system. New Applications for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology Our plans don't focus only on our mobility products. We also strive to realize zero environmental impact for all of our corporate activities. For that, we believe in using the right energy, in the right place, for the right purpose. Our new stationary fuel cell power station is a great example of this approach. Honda has been a leader in research and development of hydrogen technologies and fuel cell vehicles for more than 30 years. That gives us a lot of know-how we can apply in new zero emission applications and we are collaborating with others to create new energy solutions to maximize the benefit for society. We just announced the next-gen fuel cell system, co-developed with GM to be manufactured in Michigan, that we will apply to the Honda CR-V FCEV next year. Our goal is to use this technology to help facilitate the decarbonization of society through the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen has unique characteristics compared to energy stored in batteries. It has higher energy density, and refueling is faster than recharging. That makes it more suitable than batteries for large mobility vehicles like commercial trucks and in power sources for large infrastructure. That's why our new zero emission stationary fuel cell power station is such a significant development. Data centers require high-quality and reliable power, where any disruption can lead to downtime or problems such as data corruption and damage to servers. Typical stationary backup generators use diesel fuel, resulting in higher carbon emissions and local air pollutants. Utilizing hydrogen fuel cells offers a promising future for clean, reliable and high-quality electricity, especially when operating on \"green hydrogen,\" produced using renewable resources. Our first fuel cell power station is a proof of concept using recycled fuel cell stacks from previously leased Honda Clarity Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. By connecting multiple fuel cell systems, our demonstration stationary fuel cell unit has a capacity of about 500 kW. But as we expand this concept toward commercialization, we will utilize our next-gen fuel cell system, with plans to apply it to Honda production facilities and data centers in North America. I now find myself in a role at the intersection of our past and our future: Sustainability, building on what we know to create a new future, and developing new business models to enable that future. That's what is so exciting about the combination of announcements we've made in recent weeks. By increasing the use of renewable energy and establishing the ability to make a new Honda out of old Hondas, we are taking tangible steps toward achieving our Triple Action to Zero and our challenging global goal to achieve net zero emissions. That will benefit everyone. Jay Joseph Vice President Sustainability & Business Development American Honda Motor Co., Inc.","filter_flag":1}

AI in energy and power market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 24.68% from a market valuation of US$3.103 billion in 2021 to reach US$14.527 billion in 2028. In recent years, the energy and power markets have increasingly been relying on artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool. It has the ability to automate and optimize a number of energy-related processes, resulting in more effective and cost-effective operations, better energy management, and fewer negative environmental effects. Demand forecasting is one of the most important areas where AI is being used in the energy sector. AI systems can more accurately estimate energy consumption by examining data on consumer behavior, weather patterns, and other variables, which enables utility companies to better plan and distribute resources. Energy production and distribution may be made more efficient with AI. For instance, machine learning algorithms can examine data from solar or wind power systems to spot trends and forecast how much energy will be produced. Operators may be better able to control the production of renewable energy sources, which can be very unpredictable. Building energy management is a significant area in which AI is being used in the energy sector. AI-powered systems can track and evaluate how much energy is used in buildings, finding inefficiencies and suggesting solutions to save energy. This can cut greenhouse gas emissions and result in significant cost savings for building owners and tenants. The AI in energy and power market is primarily driven by the growing energy needs across the globe. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision can assist utilities in a number of ways, including helping to estimate demand, improve energy production and distribution, and quickly identify and fix problems with equipment. Facilities can increase the dependability and quality of their services while also enhancing their efficiency and cutting expenses. The market for AI in the energy and power industry has benefited from the rising energy demand as a result of utilities being under pressure to optimize energy production and distribution to satisfy growing demand while also ensuring that their systems remain dependable and cost-effective. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that between 2018 and 2050, the world's energy consumption would rise by almost 50%. AI can assist in addressing a number of issues associated with the use of renewable energy by anticipating the output of renewable energy, enhancing the grid's ability to integrate renewable energy, and regulating energy storage and distribution. This can lower costs and increase the sustainability of energy generation, as well as increase the reliability and stability of the power system. As a result, this market has benefited from the growing demand for and acceptance of renewable energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that over a five-year period, from 2021 to 2025, renewable energy sources will be responsible for about 90% of the increase in the world's power capacity, with solar energy alone accounting for 60% of this development.

Here we will discuss important issues and current events in the American steel industry. Our first topic is sustainability \u2013 and the leadership of the American steel industry in the green economy. Even though Earth Day 2023 has ended, every day is Earth Day for the American Steel Industry. Steel is the EnviroMetal\u2122 and here\u2019s why: The American steel industry is the cleanest of the leading steel industries in the world. Of the major steel-producing countries, the U.S. has the lowest CO\u2082 emissions per ton of steel produced. By contrast, Chinese steel production creates carbon emissions that are nearly twice that of the U.S. per ton of steel produced. The global steel industry contributes eight percent of total world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, whereas the U.S. steel industry only accounts for one-to-two percent of total U.S. GHG emissions. There are several reasons for the American steel industry\u2019s leadership in decarbonization. A key factor is that the American steel industry has adopted electric arc furnace (EAF) technology at a much more accelerated rate than the global industry. A little over 69.2 percent of the steel produced in the U.S. in 2021 was from EAFs, compared to 28.9 percent globally. In addition, the American steel industry operates blast furnaces that are among the most carbon efficient in the world. Integrated steel mills in the U.S. are almost entirely fed by domestically sourced iron ore pellets compared to CO 2 -intensive sintered ore used in China and elsewhere, resulting in significantly lower emissions of CO\u2082, as well as lower emissions of NOx, SO\u2082 and particulate matter. Also, the emissions factors associated with the energy mix used for steelmaking in the United States are lower than in other steel-producing locations in the world, with much more reliance on natural gas and renewable energy. This cleaner energy mix helps produce the lowest CO 2 emissions steel. The American steel industry is continuing to invest in clean energy to provide the electricity needed to run our mills \u2014a number of steel producers in the U.S. have developed projects that employ renewable energy to supply all or most of specific facilities\u2019 energy requirements. The steel industry in the U.S. also continues to make other key investments to further decrease its carbon emissions and advance its leadership position on sustainability. American steelmakers have made investments to increase the use of direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI), which can lower emissions for both integrated blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steel mills and EAF steel mills. Additionally, new DRI and HBI facilities are being designed and have recently been built to be hydrogen-ready once clean hydrogen is available on an industrial scale and commercially viable. In addition, steel is a critical component in the continued development of all clean energy technologies to reduce America\u2019s carbon footprint. According to a recent study by McKinsey &Co, steel is the only material critical to all low-carbon technologies. Wind, solar, and tidal renewable energy systems, zero-emission electric vehicles, electric grid transmission, hydrogen production, and carbon capture systems all highly depend on steel. For example, steel comprises over 70 percent of the weight of a typical wind turbine. Grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) is a critical and irreplaceable material used in the production of power and distribution transformers that will be necessary for the greening and modernization of the domestic electric grid. American non-oriented electrical steel (NOES) is used for electric motors, including those that will power the growing electric vehicle (EV) market. The American steel industry and its construction partners have also proactively and voluntarily published verified Environmental Product Declarations, which report the carbon footprint and other potential environmental impacts, for nearly every steel construction product available in the marketplace today. Furthermore, when steel construction products have outlived their current intended use, they can be recycled into new steel to be used for any variety of new products. Steel is the most recycled material in the world and can be continually recycled into new products. Today\u2019s steel beam can become tomorrow\u2019s refrigerator, soup can or car door. Sustainable steelmaking is the American steel industry\u2019s number one commitment \u2013 for our customers and all Americans. Our entire industry is continuing to make key investments and innovations to further decrease carbon emissions and advance our leadership position on sustainability.

This industry is key to the fight against global warming, given that it emits 34% of total emissions. Decarbonizing power generation will require outsized investments in renewables not only to replace existing fossil fuel-based power generation but also to meet increased power demand due to higher rates of home, auto, and industrial electrification. Meanwhile, major investments in the grid will be needed to connect new renewable resources, manage distributed and intermittent generation, and harden transmission and distribution networks against more extreme weather. These investments will drive the bulk of the value opportunity for machinery makers. Industrial Processes. This sector includes mining; the production of chemicals, metals, and cement; and the downstream manufacturing of a wide variety of machinery and end products. Here, the need to decarbonize both production processes and supply chains will require advancing a wide variety of new technologies, some of them still in their infancy. Switching to sustainable fuels or high-load electrification will be needed for processes with high heat requirements, and technologies for optimizing heat and power will be needed to manage costs and emissions. Still, the release of some emissions will be unavoidable, likely requiring carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies. Agriculture. Agriculture and related changes in land use account for more than 20% of global GHG emissions. These potent emissions are driven by methane and nitrous oxide in addition to CO 2 . Methane emissions come primarily from livestock, while the application of fertilizer produces nitrous oxide. Conventional farming practices, such as tilling and overgrazing, have resulted in the loss of up to a quarter of the original carbon stock in the world\u2019s soil. Changes in land use is another significant contributor, as growing demand for agricultural output continues to fuel deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, resulting in the further destruction of natural carbon stores. Transportation. The automotive industry is currently undergoing a fundamental change, as vehicles shift from using the internal combustion engine to using battery electric powertrains. Navigating this change will require massive investments not only in machinery to manufacture electric vehicles but also in the charging infrastructure required to support them. Over the long term, heavy-duty trucks may shift to hydrogen as a fuel source for hauling freight over longer distances. Machinery to manufacture electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure to support them will require massive investment. Decarbonizing the aviation and maritime industries presents a unique set of challenges given that batteries lack the power density required for long-distance travel. Instead, these industries will turn to sustainable biofuels or synthetic power-to-X fuels that can replace existing fossil fuels with a fraction of the emissions. Biofuels will lead to new supply chains and production facilities that use specialized membranes and compressors. Power-to-X fuels will rely heavily on green hydrogen that is produced using electrolyzers and sustainably sourced CO 2 . Buildings. The most significant source of direct emissions from buildings is heating and cooling systems. Converting legacy heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to heat pumps can dramatically reduce fossil fuel use and the resulting emissions. While this switch will increase the use of electricity, more-efficient HVAC units and heat pumps can help reduce the incremental power needed from utilities. New digital technologies that manage power consumption, directing it to only where it is truly needed, will also play a key role. To construct net-zero buildings, improved insulation and decarbonized materials will be needed. Machinery makers will likely find opportunities to help industrial materials makers reduce emissions during the manufacturing process. The Challenges of Rising Demand for New Machinery As demand for new machinery, equipment, and automation systems ramps up, machinery makers will need to juggle three challenges simultaneously. They must decide which new product and technology areas to compete in, balancing their existing competencies with the needs of their customers. They must continue making their legacy offerings more efficient to remain competitive throughout the transition. And they must develop new data and analytics tools that can help support their customers\u2019 efforts to decarbonize. Meeting these challenges will be no easy task. And predictions consistently underestimate the speed at which the transition to new technologies and systems take place. (See \u201cRising Expectations.\u201d) As the pressure on industries to decarbonize increases, and as governments take a more active role in the transition, the demand for new products will likely accelerate, reach an inflection point sooner than expected, and become an avalanche. There are early signs that the US Inflation Reduction Act, for example, may be triggering a sudden increase in demand. Rising Expectations In preparing for the ramp-up to new green technologies, it behooves all machinery makers to remember that predictions consistently underestimate the pace of technological progress. For example, the actual solar photovoltaic capacity in 2020 was far higher than the predicted capacity either in 2002 or in 2010. (See the exhibit.) Current projections for 2030 show that solar photovoltaic capacity will likely exceed the earliest prediction by a factor of 36. The rapid increase in capacity has been driven in part by equally rapid decreases in cost, which by 2030 will likely have fallen three times faster than was predicted in 2008. The same trend holds true for wind power and batteries. In short, technology deployment continues to outpace expectations, driven in part by the achievement of greater cost efficiencies than expected. And rapid deployment drives greater cost efficiencies, promoting yet more deployment, creating a virtuous circle. There is no reason to believe that the next generation of green tech will be any different. In short, technology deployment continues to outpace expectations, driven in part by the achievement of greater cost efficiencies than expected. And rapid deployment drives greater cost efficiencies, promoting yet more deployment, creating a virtuous circle. There is no reason to believe that the next generation of green tech will be any different. Opportunity Strikes As substantial as the challenges may seem, the green tech opportunity for machinery makers is equally vast\u2014about $27 trillion through 2040 across six critical technology categories. (See Exhibit 2.) And while the opportunity is significant in each category, it is important to note that the growth trajectories for each type of technology will vary considerably given their current maturity and future innovations.","filter_flag":1}

Delta Electronics\u2019 Americas Headquarters Becomes First LEED Zero Energy-Certified Green Building in Fremont, California Delta, a global provider of IoT-based smart green solutions, has announced its Americas regional headquarters (HQs) has become the first green building in Fremont, CA, and second in the Silicon Valley Bay Area, to achieve the LEED Zero Energy certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The accolade, granted to green buildings that generate as much electricity as they consume, has been attained thanks to the further implementation of Delta\u2019s own solutions on this originally LEED Platinum facility. A new solar PV carport, supported by a 330kWh Delta energy storage system, now helps to increase the building\u2019s annual green electricity generation to over 1.4 million kWh. With 32 green buildings(1) enabled worldwide, Delta\u2019s solutions are nurturing sustainable cities. \u201cJust as Fremont leads the way in clean technology, Delta Electronics continues to set the industry standard for building performance. The company\u2019s built-to-suit Americas HQ in Fremont previously laid claim to being one of the earliest private sector LEED Platinum facilities in California. Today, Delta Electronics sets another milestone as only the second facility in the entire Bay Area to achieve LEED Zero-Energy,\" said Lily Mei, mayor of Fremont. She added, \u201cAs one of the greenest cities in the nation, we're proud that Delta Electronics continues to showcase sustainability through thoughtful application of technology, including using its Fremont facility as a proving grounds for many of its own products while working through pandemic disruptions to invest even further in our community.\u201d Kelvin Huang, president of Delta Electronics (Americas), said, \u201cFremont has been Delta\u2019s home in the Americas for over 30 years, so it is an honor for us to contribute to our community with the environmental and social benefits of the city\u2019s very first LEED Zero Energy green building. With its net-zero energy capabilities, our Americas HQs green building will contribute even further to Delta\u2019s RE100 initiative, which is a promise to power our worldwide operations with renewable electricity by 2030. By developing smart energy-saving solutions capable of fostering green buildings and sustainable cities, Delta demonstrates that its ESG-embedded business model can bolster mankind\u2019s environmental goals.\u201d Aided with an energy-conscious design that utilizes geographical advantages unique to Fremont while considering the productivity and needs of its operations, the Delta Americas HQs building is an example of what a total integrated solution can look like. The most recent upgrades made possible with Delta\u2019s own IoT-based Smart Green Solutions are: The facility generates over 1.4 million kWh of renewable electricity through a 616kW rooftop solar PV system and a recently constructed 504kW bi-facial PV carport system, both supported by Delta\u2019s high-efficiency PV inverters. That green energy output covers 100% of its consumption needs over a full calendar year. The recent addition of a 330 kWh Delta energy storage system helps to optimize energy management in the facility. A recent enhancement of Delta\u2019s data center cooling solution, featuring a dedicated economizer supported by our own DC brushless electronically commutated (EC) fans and variable frequency drives for HVAC applications, have contributed significantly in lowering the annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the building\u2019s data center from 1.5 originally to as low as 1.25. Optimized energy management is also attained by the implementation of Delta\u2019s next-generation SCADA system and building control platform. The former is VTScada, the industry\u2019s most powerful SCADA system, developed by Canadian-based Trihedral, a Delta Group Company; the latter is the enteliWEB building control platform, developed by Canadian-based Delta Controls, also a Delta Group Company. These platforms integrate seamlessly with the existing building sub-systems, such as HVAC, LED lighting and other energy-intensive applications, to create set points, collect data and track trends, create reports, and manage alarms, remotely. With unlimited scalability, this solution grows with the facility as new solutions are integrated to ensure lower energy consumption. Here are some of the original integrated solutions that made Delta Americas\u2019 HQs a LEED Platinum green building back in 2018, and that have certainly contributed to the new LEED Zero Energy certification: HVAC Host to one of the largest geothermal systems in Silicon Valley, Delta\u2019s unique location in the Bay Area takes advantage of the natural underground warm springs. With over 20 miles of horizontal piping at 15 and 30 feet depths, a Delta VFD circulates water in a closed-loop system to exchange heat for an HVAC system estimated to be 70% more efficient than a cooling tower. 92 miles of piping is embedded in the facility\u2019s floors and ceilings for radiant heating and cooling, providing stable and comfortable temperatures, efficiently. Working in collaboration with CBE Berkeley, this system has been a case study to determine optimal operations and controls for maximum energy efficiency. Lighting With LED lighting systems in the parking lot and around the office, Delta\u2019s lighting controls integrates with its building management system to ensure smooth operations at all hours. Taking advantage of the floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows, the open floor plan, and low-e windows, zones are created to minimize waste from excessive lighting. Light meters placed around the office ensure sufficient light-levels for safety and productivity.

These cover company-owned and -controlled resources and indirect emissions from energy generation. Yet taking a strategic approach to addressing Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions that arise across the value chain) often represents the bigger challenge. That said, growing regulatory and investor pressure makes addressing Scope 3 emissions increasingly urgent. For example, as part of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), fund managers in Europe are required to report Scope 3 emissions in their portfolios starting in 2023. Moreover, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provides companies seeking validation for their Scope 3 targets with near-term criteria. For example, Scope 3 emissions targets are required for companies whose emissions are 40 percent or more of the combined total for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Previous McKinsey research has focused on how companies are pursuing the dual mission of profitability and sustainability. In particular, we showed that building data transparency and tracking across the value chain are prerequisites to identifying Scope 3 carbon sources and developing concrete plans to reduce emissions. We also showed that decarbonization can be a value-creating opportunity for companies that \u201cplay offense,\u201d such as by capturing green premiums or building new green businesses. In this article, we focus on how organizations in several industries can start capturing that value by reducing Scope 3 emissions. Upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions strategies Lowering life cycle emissions requires not only new operational processes and technologies but also collaboration with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Lower emissions can lead organizations to radically transform business strategies by rethinking commercial models, making portfolio moves, and building partnerships across the value chain, as well as sourcing new low-carbon inputs and changes to product specifications to reduce emissions during the use stage. Of course, approaches will vary depending on the industry and business model, both of which ultimately determine whether the bulk of emissions sit upstream or downstream. For instance, downstream Scope 3 emissions are not as high of a priority in steel production as they are in the automotive industry. Across industries, however, we have identified six levers for reducing Scope 3 emissions that can help companies that are playing offense capture value pools (exhibit). 1. Supplier and customer selection Tackling emissions in the selection and engagement of suppliers requires lowering input emissions or securing low-carbon supply. Dual-mission sourcing\u2014buying a product that minimizes both cost and carbon footprint\u2014is emerging as the new standard across procurement teams. In the automotive sector, Volvo Trucks is designing vehicles made from fossil-free steel in collaboration with a Swedish steel player, while other commercial-vehicle companies are investing in green steel made with hydrogen to secure future supply. Downstream, organizations can seek to work collaboratively with customers to encourage emissions reductions during product processing and use. For example, heavy-equipment manufacturer Komatsu collaborated with its customers in planning, developing, testing, and deploying zero-emissions mining equipment. 2. Product specification and solutions Leading automotive OEMs are increasingly implementing dual-mission design to value, a concept that aims to reduce both costs and product life cycle emissions. Emission-reduction approaches typically focus on adapting products to reduce input emissions. Some companies are reducing virgin-resource demand while still meeting specifications or safety requirements by changing historical formulations and specifications, such as for material thickness and the use of raw-material substitutes and filler materials. Other companies are shifting production to enable the use of bio-based inputs. By contrast, downstream approaches include developing or adapting products that enable reduced emissions when customers use them. To meet the high-quality input requirements of low-carbon steel processing, mining company BHP is working with steel manufacturer HBIS to research how iron ore can be optimally processed for use in direct-reduced-iron (DRI) processes, a technology with lower emissions than traditional blast furnaces. In addition, automotive producers are replacing metals with plastics to cut costs and reduce use-phase emissions due to \u201clightweighting,\u201d or improving fuel efficiency by building vehicles with lighter components. It\u2019s also worth noting that some products with a carbon footprint, such as insulation materials, can have a positive effect on global emissions. This has led to the introduction of Scope 4 emissions, defined as the amount of emissions mitigated by a product\u2019s use. 3. Partnerships Targeted partnerships across the value chain, particularly those focused on developing and leveraging new technologies, can help create low-carbon product lines and processes, which can in turn drive decarbonization actions. For example, mining company Vale and steelmaker Boston Metal partnered to develop molten-oxide electrolysis (MOE) technology, which can enable lower-carbon steel production by converting fine powders directly into high-purity molten iron via electrolysis. Similarly, mining company Anglo American and thyssenkrupp Steel plan to collaborate to develop high-quality input stock for lower-carbon steel production. In the consumer goods space, specialty-chemical company Evonik teamed up with Unilever to develop and scale bio-based rhamnolipid surfactants for use in dishwasher detergent, which can help lower the carbon intensity of inputs. 4. End-of-life solutions Recycling and circular solutions can help reduce both downstream and upstream emissions. Specifically, circularity can reduce end-of-life emissions downstream and potentially secure recycled raw materials, thereby reducing emissions upstream. Several chemical players are developing advanced recycling capabilities. And Danish energy company \u00d8rsted created a circularity partnership with German steel producer Salzgitter to use recycled wind turbine scrap in steel-production processes. 5. Green portfolio strategies Companies with significant downstream emissions can consider building on existing capabilities to move into new green business segments. This move can help create significant value in addition to lowering the overall carbon footprint of their portfolios, particularly from processing and product use. For example, Schneider Electric pivoted from providing hardware to concentrating on energy management solutions. And Neste pledged to make significant investments to shift its portfolio from oil to biofuels. 6. Value chain integration Integration upstream within the value chain can increase control over input-related emissions, while integration downstream can help increase control of emissions during processing and use. For example, mining company LKAB made the move downstream to process iron using DRI. Value chain integration can also lead to a shift from Scope 3 emissions to Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 decarbonization levers: Industry examples There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to reducing Scope 3 emissions. The relative importance of various emission-reduction levers is highly dependent on the specific industry, its position in the value chain, and the business model. These factors determine where emissions sit, where the green value pools are, and, consequently, where Scope 3 decarbonization needs to be focused (table). Automotive companies For automotive producers, most Scope 3 emissions occur during the use phase of a vehicle, which is currently being addressed by the shift toward electrification and the growth of green electricity. As electrification increases, the decarbonization focus shifts to securing a low-carbon supply of input materials, notably steel, aluminum, and batteries. Leading players in the automotive sector are actively striving to achieve full transparency of emissions throughout the value chain, with many OEMs expanding their in-house knowledge because standards are lacking and suppliers have limited knowledge about CO 2 . This increased transparency is required for automotive companies to define concrete actions to abate emissions through finding and securing alternative energy sources across the value chain, expanding the use of recycled material, and designing products with lower-emission materials. For example, the most promising levers in rim production focus on using renewable energy to smelt aluminum and increasing the share of recycled aluminum. However, additional levers can focus on tier-one suppliers, such as reducing energy use during the painting process. Suppliers in Asia have shown that several of these levers, including shifting to a different aluminum supplier with lower emission levels, are achievable at the same or even lower cost while reducing emissions by more than 50 percent. Chemical companies Scope 3 emissions for chemical players are generally split between upstream and downstream. That said, the primary focus is typically on sourcing low-carbon feedstock or increasing the share of recycled or biobased feedstock (the latter of which would likely require some technical adaptations). These efforts can be achieved by partnering with low-carbon or recycled- or bio-based-feedstock providers, as well as moving into recycling to offer end-of-life solutions and secure recycled feedstocks. Mining companies For mining companies, most Scope 3 emissions are downstream, resulting from the processing of mined materials. Actions to reduce these emissions thus involve working with downstream players to develop and adopt lower-emission processing technologies and ensuring that the company\u2019s own products are appropriately specified. Within commodities for which there is room for collaboration, such as iron ore, there are many examples of technology adoption via partnerships. Value integration downstream and selection of customers already adopting lower-emission technology are also possible. Building-materials companies For building-materials producers, an important part of upstream Scope 3 emissions comes from the use of raw materials such as aluminum, cement, clay, copper, glass, gypsum, steel, and timber\u2014both in the production of building products and in customer use of those products. Addressing these emissions will likely entail long-term partnerships with suppliers to codevelop and coinvest in decarbonizing current production and building new capacity. Furthermore, there are benefits in reviewing (historical) product specifications and requirements, such as the thickness of end products, the potential use of filler materials, and the use of alternative binder materials in the case of cement. Depending on the product, this can require the expertise of real estate developers, design and engineering firms, or contractors. How to tackle Scope 3 emissions Many companies struggle to develop strategies to reduce Scope 3 emissions as self-standing, internal initiatives that rely on existing capabilities. Succeeding in this task is not easy; it requires organizations to define clear strategies, develop detailed plans, embed specific organizational capabilities, build emission-tracking approaches and systems, develop certifications for products, and explore ways to secure funding and financing. The journey to successfully tackling Scope 3 emissions typically happens in three stages: a baselining phase to define the starting point and set a North Star (how a company defines its purpose and products and works toward its goals); a bottom-up planning phase to develop granular initiatives to reach the North Star, identify the key enablers to be successful, and start putting the organization in place; and, finally, a long-term delivery phase in which initiatives are implemented, carbon reduction and improvements are tracked, green products are certified, and capabilities are built at scale. Based on our market analysis, we have identified seven critical success factors that can help companies create Scope 3 emissions plans that suit their circumstances: Create an understanding of your starting point. Develop a granular emissions baseline to understand the key areas and drivers of Scope 3 emissions. This can help determine targeted actions to take, particularly those related to allocating investments and resources in the most efficient and effective ways possible. Define your North Star. Take a value-creating lens when setting the target. In other words, don\u2019t just look at Scope 3 emissions from a risk management perspective: develop an understanding of the areas in which customers are willing to pay a premium for greener products. Set up cross-functional teams to integrate efforts across the organization. Many Scope 3 strategies require extensive collaboration across business units and functions, including procurement, supply chain, R&D, and sales. For example, developing a range of plastic products with renewable feedstock can require close collaboration with suppliers to procure the appropriate feedstock, adaptations to production processes, product design, and a product launch strategy. With these points in mind, a clear strategic vision driven from the top and underpinned by a value-creation rationale is crucial to keep efforts on track. Go beyond the organization and embrace partnerships across the value chain to decarbonize. Collaborative efforts across the value chain are required to create green product lines that could even sell at a premium. Companies can create transparency around how partnerships can help achieve a North Star, including mapping the benefits for each stakeholder before setting up the ecosystem and bringing together key stakeholders. Furthermore, many automotive players are reconsidering their roles in the value chain to increase control\u2014for example, by partnering or even integrating vertically upward in the value chain. Collaborate with suppliers, peers, and customers to set data and tracking standards. Although there are typically no clear industry standards for data and tracking, collaboration can help companies track information flows. Instead of waiting for standards to take shape, companies can act today to help determine future standards. Launch a capability academy to upskill the entire organization at scale. Scope 3 emissions touch on the whole organization and entail a range of new capabilities. For example, executives will need to understand the challenges and opportunities, sales will need to sell green products and get the fact base right, procurement will need to incorporate carbon in the supplier selection and negotiation process, and R&D will need to embrace the principle of dual-mission design to value and challenge historical product formulations and specifications. Regarding these points, best-in-class players are setting up academies and designing tailored learning journeys to develop sustainability capabilities across the entire organization at scale. Provide incentives to reduce carbon across the value chain. An internal carbon price can help institutionalize CO 2 as part of the decision-making process. Assigning a monetary value to Scope 3 emissions can help teams make informed business cases and trade-off choices. For example, procurement teams can compare raw materials with different carbon footprints, and R&D or product teams can develop new products with the potential to reduce downstream emissions. Furthermore, successful companies link variable pay to achieving specified Scope 3 milestones. Reducing Scope 3 emissions requires organizations to tackle big challenges boldly, through the lens of value creation and with the involvement of the entire organization. The high value at stake and the complex challenges of achieving it warrant starting now. Getting Scope 3 emissions right can lead to transformative industry innovations and result in significant strides toward net-zero pathways.","filter_flag":1}

Goodyear tires that include Monolith's carbon black have already passed rigorous Department of Transportation testing for safety and performance. \"At Goodyear, we are continually looking at and working with our supply base to understand and discover new innovations and technologies to use in our products,\" said Chris Helsel, senior vice president, global operations, and chief technology officer, Goodyear. \"The use of carbon black produced by methane pyrolysis is an example of how we are collaborating with our suppliers, like Monolith, to utilize sustainable materials in our consumer products, without compromising on performance and safety.\" Carbon black is an essential material found in countless everyday products, but most notably is used in tires. According to Goodyear, a typical consumer tire is comprised of up to 20 percent carbon black by weight. Conventional carbon black is produced by burning decant oil or coal tar, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Through its proprietary methane pyrolysis process, Monolith has developed technology that can use clean electricity to convert natural gas into carbon black and hydrogen. This more environmentally responsible process is designed to create virtually zero emissions in the manufacturing process and potentially reduce tire life cycle emissions. Goodyear and Monolith first entered into a collaboration agreement in December 2021 for the development and potential use of Monolith's carbon black for its tires. Goodyear unveiled a 90% sustainable-material demonstration tire that included Monolith carbon black at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2023. \"As the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, NextEra Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to provide large-scale renewable power solutions that enable new clean technologies, including Monolith's industry-leading process to produce low-emissions carbon black and hydrogen,\" said Rebecca Kujawa, president and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy Resources, an investor in Monolith. \"Cross-industry collaborations like these are essential for decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors of the U.S. economy.\" This announcement comes on the heels of Monolith's $300 million funding round and conditional approval of a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to expand its production facilities in Nebraska. Monolith is also launching the \"Made with Monolith\" brand to help consumers understand that the trusted everyday products they already use, especially those with more environmentally friendly qualities, can make an even bigger sustainable impact when they are produced with materials produced by Monolith. Headquartered in Lincoln, Neb., Monolith was founded in 2012 and currently operates its first commercial-scale production facility in Hallam, Neb., and has offices and R&D facilities in Lincoln, Neb., San Carlos, Calif., Denver, Colo., and Kansas City, Kan. About Monolith Monolith is a next\u2013generation hydrogen and materials company that has developed proprietary technology to convert conventional, renewable or responsibly-sourced natural gas into carbon black and hydrogen in a more environmentally sound manner. Monolith is backed by investors including Azimuth Capital Management, Cornell Capital, Decarbonization Partners, Imperative Science Ventures, Magnetar Capital, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, NextEra Energy Resources Inc., SK Inc., TPG Rise Climate and Warburg Pincus.

Chinese manufacturer Goodwe started a new division focussing solely on building integrated photovoltaics or BIPV around 18 months ago, Goodwe Australia\u2019s Country Manager, Dean Williamson, and its Marketing Manager, John Wright, told pv magazine Australia at the recent Smart Energy Conference in Sydney. The company has announced its partnership with BIPV specialists Umax Energy to this end. The partnership will see Umax become the \u201cmaster distributors\u201d of GoodWe\u2019s BIPV products in Australia, while also providing technical support services including system design, onsite installation guidance, project management, and maintenance. Goodwe released the details of its first BIPV product for Australia, the lightweight Galaxy panel, in May. The new 335 W slim panel, designed for low load-bearing rooftops, received easily the most interest of all Goodwe\u2019s new products on display at the Sydney convention, Williamson and Wright said. The Galaxy is frameless and 60% lighter than conventional modules, the company says. Goodwe will also bring an integrated solar roof tile to Australia, Williamson and Wright told pv magazine. The solar tile, targeting the residential segment, will be one of only two such products offered in Australia, the pair said. In October 2022, Melbourne-based renewable energy company Leeson Group unveiled its Australian-engineered rooftop solar tile with an efficiency of up to 19.3%. BIPV products have tended to be more successful overseas, in places like Europe where buildings are older and require specialist approaches. But with the traditional rooftop solar proposition seemingly approaching saturation in Australia, companies are now looking to fill the more niche gaps in the market. With the new BIPV division, it appears Goodwe is taking the popular \u2018full stack\u2019 strategy even further. Within the last few months, the company also launched its high voltage residential battery, as well as a battery system for commercial and industrial applications, which can be scaled to store between 101 kWh and 450 kWh.","filter_flag":1}

With the environment becoming an ever-more pressing issue for individuals and corporations feeling increased pressure to make changes, we look ahead for key sustainable trends that could help drive environmental efforts in a more positive direction. From seeking alternative food sources to stricter corporate accountability measures, can these developments shape how people, and businesses, view their environmental responsibilities? We explore the key environmental trends shaping the world and examine what impacts these trends will have, both now and in the future. Trends in sustainability look to encompass both the micro and macroeconomic sphere; people understand that their individual efforts alone won\u2019t be enough, so they\u2019re pushing governments, organizations, and businesses also to get on board with sustainability initiatives, too. As a result, a growing trend of greater transparency and setting sustainable development goals joins the fold. While consumers are driving this change, companies must follow to compete\u2014and they\u2019re just as likely to benefit. The evidence points to an upward trajectory for sustainable practices. In fact, by 2030, we can expect the \u201cgreen economy\u201d to soar to $90 trillion! Without further ado, what are the trends in sustainability shaking up the world and challenging the threat of climate change? 1. The Race To Net-Zero Continues Image by Markus Spiske As an effort for a global response to climate change, Race to Zero is still very much a key trend in sustainability, encouraging non-state actors from around the world to take urgent action towards halving emissions by 2030, with a long-term goal of achieving net-zero emissions. But if we want to make a real dent in global emissions, then tackling Scope 3\u2014the indirect emissions created by suppliers or customers related to any given organization\u2014will be key. Reducing the parts of your carbon footprint you can directly control is only part of the picture! If recent sustainability reports are any indication, in 2023, companies have sights firmly set on this challenge. For years, companies focused solely on using carbon offsetting to counteract their emissions, but now we\u2019re seeing carbon offsets alone are not enough. To truly reach net-zero emissions, we need to see more holistic manufacturing sustainability trends aiming to reduce emissions in the first place, after which any residuals may be counteracted using solutions like planting trees or direct air capture. 2. Renewable Energy Is Still On The Agenda Images by Olesia Bekh Renewable energy might seem like the macro environmental trend of last decade, but it\u2019s still very much relevant. Due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, global energy prices have been in flux. This has sparked a call for countries worldwide to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels while attempting to protect consumers against energy price inflation. We\u2019re now seeing reignited interest in renewable energy as a viable alternative. Despite a challenging 2022 for the US renewable energy sector, there is hope yet! With robust demand and promising incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), growth in the renewable energy sector could accelerate in 2023\u2014albeit with the same challenges and obstacles seen in recent years (such as supply chain constraints or increasing interest rates). But by taking proactive steps to better harness renewable energy sources now, these difficulties can be navigated while paving the way toward faster future expansion. And the future, it seems, is already here. AI is already being applied in the renewables sector to forecast consumption levels and predict maintenance needs for renewable sources. Solar innovation is catapulting the industry forward, making clean energy more accessible than ever before, with floatovoltaics taking off as a new trend in solar power solutions. 3. Regenerative Agriculture Gains Exposure Image by Bence Balla-Schottner In recent years, regenerative agriculture has become an increasingly popular way for farmers to cultivate land\u2014so much so that we now have third-party certifications, like Regenerative Organic Certified (ROC), to verify such claims. By using practices inspired by nature\u2019s design and replenishing natural resources, this approach is helping decrease the impacts of climate change while also improving biodiversity. Although only 19% of people were familiar with the concept in a 2022 Food Insight survey, 30% still chose regenerative agriculture as one of the most beneficial agricultural practices, indicating that commitment towards sustainable farming methods continues to grow among consumers. It\u2019s likely more focus will be placed on these techniques beyond 2023 as companies become further invested in understanding where and how their ingredients were produced. It makes sense from a business perspective; improving soil health and diversifying crops grown can help foster food security across seasons, which then generates better economic growth and outcomes for all involved. 4. Consumers Crave Alternative Proteins Image by fcafotodigital Eco-friendly retail trends remain a huge driving factor when it comes to shaping the market, and consumer food selections are known to have a significant impact on the environment. This is a perfect example of how micro-environmental trends change both the world we live in, and how we exist within it. The food consumers want is the food businesses try to deliver. And since consumers are becoming more aware of how plant-based diets could help to protect the planet, more plant-based food products are hitting supermarket shelves. But, as with most sustainable lifestyle trends, change takes time; altering meat consumption patterns is a decades-long shift, not a rapid switch. While some tout insects as the alternative protein source, whether we\u2019re any closer to swapping our sushi rolls for silkworm larvae remains to be seen. There are some key expectations that need to be met as plant-based eating goes mainstream, and consumers seek out meat alternatives. In fact, 40% of consumers say they intend to purchase alternative protein products in 2023. However, those same consumers won\u2019t compromise on taste or texture, demonstrating a clear need for new products that satisfy all these factors. The search for a plant-based protein alternative that looks, tastes, and feels like meat has possibly given rise to a new, growing segment of \u2018hybrid\u2019 meat-eaters. Consumers seek alternative protein blends that combine both plant-based protein and animal protein (though in a lesser quantity) in a convenient ready-to-cook form, such as sausages, burgers, and mince. 5. Focus On Corporate Sustainability Trends Grows Image by Thithawat_s Sustainability trends in business, including adopting more sustainable products or business practices, offer benefits beyond just good public relations; they come with real financial benefits, too! On top of the moral incentive, companies now have clear monetary motivations for committing to eco-friendly practices and sustainable operations. Three notable areas within this wider trend are ESG, greater supply chain sustainability, and a pivot toward more sustainable packaging. ESG\u2014referring to the \u2018environmental, social, and governance\u2019 goals and objectives of a business to help manage impacts on the environment and society\u2014is a hot topic. Various ESG trends driving and shaping sustainable business practices into the future\u2014but what are some ESG trends? ESG not only makes a business favorable to investors (ESG investing is one of the more prevalent ESG trends today), but it can also improve the overall financial performance. Supply chain sustainability trends also indicate a wider shift toward more sustainable business practices, such as eliminating single-use plastics or shifting toward a circular economy model. Not only does this promote less energy consumption and greater energy efficiency, it also offers economic benefits. Using materials already in the supply chain saves money on new raw materials and can help companies protect themselves from the supply chain shortages that plagued business consumers alike in 2021-2022. Switching to sustainable packaging is also on many businesses\u2019 agendas, to help reduce their environmental impact. We must progress toward reducing our global reliance on damaging forms of packaging, and businesses recognize this. Such packaging sustainability trends are transpiring right now. Costco is working to divert 600,000 tons of packaging waste each year, while Innocent Drinks promises to reduce 2,500 tons of plastic bottles by 2023 and switch entirely to recycled or plant-based materials in less than 10 years. 6. Greenwashing Is Out & Brand Transparency Is In Image by designer491 Ever noticed companies making bold green claims with no real evidence to back them up? Research has revealed that over 40% of randomly selected websites made false claims about their eco-friendly credentials in recent years. With eco-friendly trends continuing to dominate the consumer landscape, it\u2019s easy to see why (though this doesn\u2019t make it any less unethical). Companies make bold claims about their sustainable development goals, and at the same time, are vague about their carbon emissions, and overall environmental sustainability strategy. This is known as \u2018greenwashing\u2018, a technique used by some businesses to convince customers they are doing their part for the environment\u2014even when untrue. Consumers are becoming more aware of such false sustainable marketing, and therefore more transparency is needed. When it comes to meaningful consumer trends, sustainability is now more than just a label, and brands need to be more forthcoming in their eco-credentials if they want to retain customers (and avoid potential legal action). Moving forward, we\u2019ll likely see companies and investors tested on their sustainability commitments\u2019 authenticity. Governments worldwide, including Europe (currently leading in legislation), have passed laws requiring comprehensive sustainability reporting from businesses, a legal obligation that must not be taken lightly. The recent introduction of the sustainable finance disclosure regulation (SFDR) means that all financial market participants are required to make climate-related financial disclosures public. So, moving forward, environmental trends in marketing are likely to grow but in a more honest and transparent way as brands become more discerning in their messaging. It\u2019s no longer good enough to simply spout green credentials; real change has to begin internally. If greenwashing can affect the bottom line (and thanks to the SFDR, it can), then organizations must take heed. 7. Sustainable Smart Cities Are The Future Image by ponsulak Cities around the world are leveraging technology to create a smarter and more sustainable future. These so-called \u2018smart cities\u2019 employ a range of eco-friendly practices\u2014from building with green materials, to adopting micro-mobility solutions, and even transitioning toward circular economies. Smart cities and sustainability intersect in many ways, including the reduction and consumption of resources more efficiently. Rob Hopkins, author of From What Is To What If, shared his thoughts with Pebble regarding the way that cities will shape the future of sustainability: \u201cIt will be a time when big bold ideas for reimagining how cities feed and power themselves, create new jobs and engage and retrain people will become the norm. As Naomi Klein once put it, \u2018There are no non-radical solutions left\u2019. \u201cIt will be a time when cities are out-competing each other to get to zero carbon first and to come up with the most imaginative strategies for doing so.\u201d This need for radical change in how cities are designed and built is a common theme within the sustainability movement, though it hasn\u2019t quite been realized, and we rarely see such profound solutions. Vehicle-free cities are yet to exist, despite plans to build them, and while there is a clear need for cities with smart outdoor lighting or intelligent traffic management, such things are costly to implement. This doesn\u2019t mean smart cities are a dying dream. Quite the contrary! The need for radical innovation is the driving force. By the year 2050, 68% of the world\u2019s population is projected to live in urban areas, placing further importance on building adaptive smart cities to enhance society through innovation. 8. Working From Home Is Here To Stay Image by svetikd Since the global Pandemic turned the world upside down, remote work has become the norm for many businesses. As the world recovers, the benefits of working from home are here to stay. 2020 started it all, but for this sustainability trend, 2023 levels of remote workers are just the beginning Experts predict that by 2025, more than 36 million Americans will work from home, 417% more than before 2020. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Working from home doesn\u2019t just boost productivity and improve work-life balance. It also has tangible environmental benefits. As more people work from home, there\u2019s less traffic on the roads and fewer emissions from cars and public transportation. The end result? A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. A report from Owl Labs & Global Workplace Analytics states that remote work has already reduced emissions equivalent to taking 600,000 cars off the road in the US. As more companies adopt a remote-first approach, these numbers will grow higher. It\u2019s not just about reducing emissions from transportation. Advances in technology mean that businesses can also save energy by allowing employees to work remotely. With fewer people in office buildings, there\u2019s less demand for heating, lighting, and other energy-hungry resources. Remote work is a low-carbon trend that\u2019s here to stay, and will continue to be the norm, rather than the exception. 9. Expect Greener Travel, Transport, & Tourism Eco Trends Image by RossHelen Eco-friendly travel, transport, and tourism are all consumer sustainability trends that have a profound effect on the macro environment. By reducing the number of flights taken or selecting eco-conscious airports, consumers communicate their need for greener travel options, and businesses will have no choice but to respond. As they say, you vote with your dollar. Improvements to sustainable transport options\u2014such as increased bicycle use, low-carbon public transport, and the roll-out of more electric cars\u2014have also been steadily evolving for most countries, and we can expect this to continue. While some countries are adopting energy-efficient electric vehicles more quickly than others, it\u2019s clear that these modes of transport are becoming commonplace on roads and highways worldwide. Emphasizing the need to reduce over-reliance on car transport is a key example of current sustainability trends in greener transportation. Many \u2018eco-conscious\u2019 countries, like Malta, Luxembourg, and Spain, are already encouraging public transport and bike use by offering some free public transport options to their citizens as part of a wider sustainability strategy. We can expect ecological trends like more sustainable options in the tourism industry to follow suit, such as limiting capacity to popular attractions (as is already the case with the Ghibli Park theme park) and greater efforts to offset an attractions\u2019 carbon against the visitors\u2019 own footprint (like Blenheim Palace is doing). It stands to reason that greener travel and tourism options are key trends in sustainability that will continue to gain popularity well into the future.","filter_flag":1}

Lack of government engagement, support and funding are significant barriers in the offshore renewable energy sector. Most firms cite financial constraints as a significant restriction to the development of new products and services. 'Ireland has the natural resources and the unique geographical location to be the global leader in these sectors.\u2019 A lack of government engagement, support and funding are highlighted as the main barriers for Irish firms when entering or doing business in the Irish offshore renewable energy sector, a Cork University Business School (CUBS) research finds today. 214 firms in Ireland\u2019s offshore industry were surveyed in the report which reveals a national picture of the common challenges and strengths for firms operating in the sector. Key findings in the report - Innovation, Networking and Policy in the Offshore Renewable Energy Sector \u2013 include: Insufficient support and engagement by government and a lack of funding were highlighted as the main barriers to innovation for firms. Government support was seen as a critical facilitator for the creation of enhanced networking and collaborative opportunities that promote innovation activity. Firms in the UK and Europe reported collaborative, bureaucratic, funding, wider infrastructural and regulatory challenges for their operations. These difficulties were noticeably greater for Irish interviewees. Most firms cite financial constraints as a significant restriction to the development of new products and services. Strong Industry-University relations are evident, but industry interviewees criticised rigid university semesters and academic incentives that prioritised publication over industry impact, as barriers hindering more fruitful industry-university collaborations. Some respondents cited a lack of industry experience from academics as a problem in interactions highlighting that academics fail to see the challenges from an industry perspective. Networking with other firms and Higher Education Institutions was cited as the main factor to increase supply into the sector. \u201cIn order to stimulate technological investment and commercialization in the sector, it is vital to have both firm funding commitments and a stable policy and planning environment. Presently there is huge uncertainty around these factors in Ireland,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Frank Crowley, lecturer in Economics at Cork University Business School and Co-Director of the Spatial and Regional Economics Research Centre at University College Cork (UCC). \u201cIreland has the natural resources and the unique geographical location to be the global leader in these sectors of the future. But now, I don\u2019t see the commitment or the will from Government. There is too much second guessing on the technology and taking an adoptive and wait and see approach. The technologies are advancing, we see sites in Scotland, Wales, Portugal, the U.S. The technology will get cheaper and no matter what renewable tech becomes superior, be it offshore wind, wave or tidal, we still need to prepare our infrastructure, our ports, our grid, our research centres, and our supply chains. Certainty, commitment, and leadership by Ireland is needed sooner rather than later,\u201d said Dr Crowley. Role of universities is key The report found that strong industry-university relations are evident, but industry interviewees criticised rigid university semesters and academic incentives that prioritised publication over industry impact as barriers hindering more fruitful industry-university collaboration. \u201cKnowledge brokers like Higher Education Institutions and special purpose Research Centres are likely to play a critical role in acting as platforms and anchors of coordination between government, industry, university and the wider society in the regional renewable energy innovation system, if the sector is to be successful,\u201d Dr Crowley added. The study as part of a wide research agenda into the sector will be launched later today (Wednesday, 10 May at 1.30pm) at University College Cork. Most of the surveyed firms have over a decade of experience and are mainly micro in size with a highly educated workforce. Most firms in the sector are engaged in the earlier phases of technological development and the majority cite financial constraints as a significant restriction to the development of new products and services. This research was conducted by the SELKIE work-package 9 research team which was led by researchers at the Spatial and Regional Economics Research Centre (SRERC) at Cork University Business School in UCC. The Centre focuses on research in the areas of regional economics, economic geography, innovation, labour markets, and environmental impacts.","filter_flag":1}

With over a year since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the EU is still faced with energy instability and a cost-of-living crisis, which have prompted a rapid roll-out of measures \u2013 from diversifying energy sources to a move towards renewables in the medium and long term. \"Politicians have naturally been keen to alleviate the worst effects of rising food and energy prices for people. This has led to tensions around whether long-term ambitions to shift towards a green economy should be postponed in favour of tackling shorter-term challenges,\" the authors of the report stated. \"But such a black-and-white dichotomy is false.\" A key long-term solution for the EU's energy and climate challenges is a circular economy, they stressed. Meeting climate targets \u201cThe war in Ukraine has led to increased energy costs at a time when we also need to reduce our energy use,\" said Tahmid Chowdhury, Materials and Products Taskforce lead at CISL Brussels in a press release, adding that the report demonstrates that circular solutions can have a triple benefit. \"Reducing carbon emissions, reducing energy consumption and reducing material use \u2013 a win both for the economy and the environment,\" he said. \"This will be a key requirement in future European Industrial Policy and will enable us to have a thriving industry, to meet our climate targets while also respecting our limited planetary resources.\" While current energy policies look to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%, research shows that circular approaches have the potential to address the remaining 45% of emissions stemming from material production. On top of a shift towards renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels, the EU also plans to cut its use of energy by at least 13% (up from 9% in 2022). The circular economy will be a key driver for the bloc\u2019s climate ambitions by reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A key factor will be keeping materials and products in the economy for longer, encouraging reuse and repair, and imposing mandatory recycling measures. Drawing on examples from leading progressive businesses in Europe, the report demonstrates how many are already benefitting from this shift to a circular economy \u2013 as well as the challenges they are facing. A global manufacturer of construction materials, Saint-Gobain, for example, launched a \u2018Glass Forever roadmap\u2019 in 2017, aiming to increase the proportion of recycled glass in its glass production to 50% by 2025. Not only did this result in reduced emissions, but the process also used significantly less energy than melting virgin materials. \"Fostering circularity and decarbonisation in the built environment are two top priorities for us. Introducing greater circularity into our production makes a significant impact,\" said C\u00e9line Carr\u00e9, Head of Public Affairs at Saint-Gobain. \"Every ton of cullet (recycled glass) introduced into glass production saves 1.2 tonnes of virgin material, whilst the melting process of cullet uses 30% less energy than melting virgin materials,\" she added. \"These are significant benefits which demonstrate why a circular economy can reduce material needs whilst also lowering energy consumption.\" Related News Another example is insulation provider ROCKWOOL, which created a closed-loop recycling system to allow stone wool insulation materials \u2013 typically considered waste and discarded in landfills \u2013 to be recycled and used as secondary raw material for new products. The report also provides six recommendations for policymakers on how to build greater circularity through existing policies. Notably, creating a clear vision for a new European green industrial strategy, constructing clearer supporting links between energy efficiency and circular economy policies, and supporting the development and widespread adoption of recycling technological solutions. Additionally, the recirculation of materials through fiscal policies should be enabled and applied across all stages of the product\u2019s life cycle in alignment with existing EPR fees, added by an increased use of demand-side policies for circular product services, and improving policy coherence.","filter_flag":1}

Schroders Capital Schroders Capital received regulatory approval this week from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to launch its second Long-Term Asset Fund, which will be dedicated to renewable energy and the energy transition. Schroders Greencoat, the renewable energy specialist of Schroders Capital, will manage the newly-approved LTAF, the firm said in a statement. The Schroders Greencoat LTAF is the first LTAF authorised in the UK to have an investment remit solely focused on renewable energy and energy transition-aligned infrastructure. The announcement follows the recent launch of Schroders Capital Climate+ LTAF, the UK's first LTAF. LTAFs are regulated open-ended investment vehicles designed to enable a broader range of investors, with longer-term horizons, to invest efficiently in illiquid and private assets. Richard Nourse, managing partner at Schroders Greencoat, said: \u201cWith the imminent launch of the Schroders Greencoat LTAF, we look forward to being able to offer DC investors the opportunity to make attractive and impactful long-term investments into the energy transition.\u201d Truffle Truffle Private Markets Group, which provides private markets solutions and partners with wealth managers and family offices across Europe, has launched its US Mid-Market Private Equity Programme. The programme, which has already closed 75 per cent of its target size in three months, is a fund launched by Truffle Investment Management (part of TPMG); it provides European wealth managers and family offices with exposure to a group of US mid-market private equity general partners. The first four underlying fund commitments have already closed, including investments in several access-constrained managers. Truffle expects to add at least one additional manager, with the portfolio expected to be fully committed shortly after the programme\u2019s final close. \u201cAs private wealth investors look to develop private markets programmes to meet the investment objectives of their end clients, it\u2019s important that they diversify across geographies and strategies,\u201d Jason Proctor, founder and managing director of Truffle, said. Truffle was founded in 2018, and has offices in the UK and the Netherlands. Pictet Alternative Advisors Pictet Alternative Advisors, the alternative investment specialist of the Geneva-based Pictet Group, has announced the final close of Monte Rosa VI, the sixth fund in its series of diversified, multi-manager private equity funds, and Monte Rosa Co-investments V, the fifth vehicle dedicated to co-investments. The two funds have raised an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion in capital commitments from a range of investors including clients from Pictet\u2019s wealth management business alongside a range of institutional investors, primarily in Europe. These fundraisings saw interest from existing investors in the Monte Rosa franchise and from a new and geographically diversified set of clients, the firm said in a statement. Monte Rosa VI raised a total of $1.6 billion, exceeding the predecessor vehicle that was launched in 2019 totalling $1.2 billion in commitments. Monte Rosa VI will invest primarily in North American and European buyout funds with smaller allocations across other geographies, including Asia, and strategies (venture capital, growth and turnaround), the firm continued. Co-investments and secondary transactions will account for 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the fund commitment. Monte Rosa Co-Investment V has held a final close at $900 million, reaching its hard cap and tripling the size of the 2020-vintage predecessor. The strategy targets minority investments alongside top-tier general partners (GPs), providing clients with the opportunity to invest in about 30 different companies across investment strategies \u2013 buyout, growth and venture \u2013 as well as geographies. At the time of closing, the programme was already 30 per cent invested across a dozen co-investments, the firm added.

Emissions decreased by 2% from the electricity generation sector. The decrease in industrial emissions is over 7%, with the cement industry emissions decreasing by almost 9%. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as the Competent Authority in Ireland for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), released its preliminary analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 from the ETS sector. Emissions from Irish power generation and industrial companies decreased by 4% (more than 600.000 tonnes) in 2022. This compares with a decrease of approximately 1.2% across Europe, according to preliminary analysis by carbon analysts of the data released today by the EU Commission. Ireland\u2019s ETS sector delivered a decrease in emissions in 2022 due to a combination of factors, including increased use of renewable electricity and renewable fuels as well as a decrease in cement production. In the electricity sector, there was less use of coal and peat-fired generation compared to the previous year, as conventional gas generation was available along with renewable energy. Fossil-fired power stations continued to play a strong role in meeting a high electricity demand. Laura Burke, Director General, Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWhile the decrease we are seeing for 2022 from the emissions trading sector is welcome, 2022 emissions are in fact slightly above the pre-pandemic levels in 2019,\u201d said Laura Burke, EPA Director General. \u201cMuch more needs to be done if the sectoral targets under the 2023 Climate Action Plan are to be reached. The challenges faced in the power generation sector are in sharp focus at the moment. Decisions taken now must recognise the urgency of the climate change challenge and support the delivery of reductions in emissions through the development and roll out of a range of low carbon and renewable solutions.\u201d Energy Industries show a decrease in emissions of 9.4% over the period 1990 to 2021. Over the time series, emissions from electricity generation have decreased by 10.5% whereas total electricity consumption has increased by 150.5%. Emissions from electricity generation increased from 1990 to 2001 by 54.3% and have decreased by 42.1% between 2001 and 2021. This decrease reflects the improvement in efficiency of modern gas-fired power plants replacing older peat and oil-fired plants and the increased share of renewables, primarily, wind power along with increased interconnectivity. This year was the lowest year in the 32-year time series for peat-fired electricity generation, 68% less than in 2020. These reductions reflect the gradual ending of peat-fired electricity generation for market and climate policy reasons. Emissions from electricity generation had decreased year-on-year from 2016 to 2020, but 2021 has seen an increase of 18.8% compared to 2020. In 2021, there was a tripling of coal and oil used for electricity generation due to the unavailability of enough gas-fired generation and lower renewables. Emerging business heroes of Irish Renewables As Ireland continues it ongoing objective to reduce emissions, a wide cross-section of companies are heeding the call with innovative ideas and initiatives designed to tackle the challenge of climate change head-on. Some are large corporations with a variety of divisions, while others are nimble and focused start-ups \u2014 and all are committed to investing in Ireland's huge renewable energy potential. The following companies represent a broad cross-section of this important and growing sector \u2014 some are already household names, others are the stars of tomorrow. NOVOGRID NovoGrid is a pioneer in Grid Edge Intelligence software with a suite of patented software products which benefit electricity generators and utilities.

Ireland\u2019s temperate climate is perfectly suited to the development of solar energy. While we do not benefit from the same level of sunshine as southern regions, our lower temperatures significantly improve the performance and lifetime of solar cells. Solar energy generation is as economically viable as wind energy generation in Ireland without suffering the same drawbacks from a construction and planning standpoint. NTR For two decades, NTR has invested in renewable energy and during that period has, through its associated companies, constructed and operated c.2GW of wind projects and 630MW of solar projects across Europe and the US. Since 2015, NTR has acquired and managed renewable energy investments on behalf of third party investors through its renewable energy funds. It recently announced the successful deployment of two Battery Storage Systems in Co Wexford. Gorey battery storage 9MW and Avonbeg battery storage 16 MW are contracted to provide DS3 services to EirGrid. The batteries are critical in enabling the transmission system operator to increase the levels of renewable energy on the Irish grid system. Both the Gorey and Avonbeg facilities have also achieved capacity market contracts, highlighting the increasing demand for energy storage solutions as renewable energy sources become more prevalent. SEABASED Seabased\u2019s proprietary technology generates stable and predictable power that enables grid operators to increase the amount of renewables they can incorporate into the energy mix, either through stand-alone wave parks or in combination with other renewables such as offshore wind.

Greenhouses It\u2019s hard to resist shopping at Chelsea, with a plethora of tempting things to buy. For many gardeners, a greenhouse is the most important purchase they\u2019ll make for their garden, and Chelsea offers the chance to see the finest greenhouses close up. Hartley Botanic brought a selection of greenhouses that showcased some of the different colours they can come in. Lighter coloured greenhouses are having a moment, Hartley Botanic\u2019s experts report, with Country Stone, Verona Stone and Olive Leaf proving popular choices with customers. Hartley's Victorian Chelsea greenhouse in soft green finish Olive Leaf One of Hartley\u2019s smaller models, the Victorian Chelsea greenhouse on display featured a glass-to-ground design for maximum light inside, with a door at each end. The roomy Opus Botanic was the largest greenhouse on display. Its concealed engineering and wide glass panes give it an elegant, modern feel \u2013 it would be as at home being used as a conservatory as it would a greenhouse for growing. The Victorian Villa features the heritage detail of a Victorian-era greenhouse, but given a contemporary edge in its pastel Verona Stone finish. Including accessories such as an integrated cold frame, blinds, staging and automatic roof vents, it was set up to tempt serious greenhouse growers. Shopping at Chelsea: Hartley Botanic's Opus Botanic greenhouse in Country Stone The Victorian Villa greenhouse from Hartley Botanic, finished in Verona Stone More beautiful greenhouses were on display at Alitex, alongside a range of new and prototype accessories the supplier will soon add to its range. These include a range of tiles from tile specialists Bert & May, including one specially designed for Alitex and featured in the stand\u2019s Hidcote greenhouse, and heating accessories. A new range of external blinds will soon help greenhouse growers regulate temperatures under glass in summer, while a prototype system will enable gardeners to insulate the greenhouse interior and keep it a few degrees warmer during winter. The clear plastic liner easily fixes to the greenhouse on the inside, as a smarter, easier alternative to insulating with bubble wrap. New, prototype water butts were also on display \u2013 available in the same colour as your greenhouse, or a smart dark grey \u2013 as were Alitex\u2019s new range of stand-alone cold frames with wooden bases, and last year\u2019s new addition to the range, the handy \u2018potting shoe\u2019 that keeps compost contained when you\u2019re potting up plants. Greenhouse accessories on display at Alitex included the company's new tile range with Bert & May, the 'potting shoe', a new stand-alone cold frame, and a prototype water butt that can be colour-matched to your greenhouse. Gabriel Ash specialise in cedar greenhouses and cold frames, including a range of RHS models such as the RHS Portico Greenhouse, with an attractive central porch for extra space. It can be made to any width, from 11 panels (14ft) to a maximum of 19 (24ft). At the opposite end of the scale, the company\u2019s small Upright Coldframe is the perfect size for patios, with ample room for plenty of seedlings or over-wintering plants. Shopping at Chelsea: smart cedar greenhouses and cold frames from Gabriel Ash Sculpture Never one to rest on his laurels, sculptor David Harber launched two new pieces at the 2023 show. As with so much of David Harber\u2019s work, Florio has been inspired by the natural environment and Harber\u2019s love of nature and the outdoors \u2013 it embodies plant growth, its elegantly curved copper flutes morphing skywards in a shape that emulates an unfolding flower bud. The second new launch has been designed in conjunction with British jewellery designer Annoushka Ducas MBE. Sycamore was inspired by Annoushka\u2019s iconic sycamore charm, and both Harber and Ducas have brought their expertise to the piece. Functional and beautiful, Sycamore rotates on its base to act as a spinning chair, as well as being an eye-catching piece of sculpture in its own right. At 1.75m high, its back features delicate latticework while the seat is coered in intricate detail. It\u2019s crafted from stainless steel and covered in a lustrous champagne gold finish. David Harber's Chelsea exhibit featured new launched alongside key pieces in a garden by James Doyle Associates. Florio (bottom left) and Sycamore (bottom right) are new for 2023. 'Bad Boy', Adrian Gray's impressively balanced stone sculpture. Adrian Gray returns to Chelsea with his gravity-defying stone sculptures. Two monolithic works were on display, the largest of which was \u2018Bad Boy\u2019, at 4m tall and weighing in at 11 tonnes. Adrian makes just four or five of his pieces each year. \u201cThe job of selecting the stones, trying different compositions, strapping, balancing and making a safe sculpture cannot be rushed,\u201d he says. The sculptor is drawn to rocks with unqiue shapes and sculptural elements, something that the Cornish granite boulders he uses supply in abundance. James Parker brought new piece (right) to Chelsea 2023, as well as DNA of a Dancer (left) James Parker Sculpture unveiled new pieces at this year\u2019s show, including \u2018Pine Cone\u2019 in patinated bronze, which is available in a range of sizes, and \u2018Leaf\u2019. James\u2019s \u2018DNA of a Dancer\u2019 in stacked slate is one of his most sought-after sculptures, so took pride of place in his Chelsea display. New additions to A Place in the Garden\u2018s range of stylish zinc accessories on display at the show included the newly introduced Porto Planters. Inspired by Mediterranean wine barrels, they\u2019re available in small, medium and large sizes. A new water feature, Luna, has just been launched, too. A contemporary bowl-shaped feature with a gently bubbling central spout, it\u2019s perfect for more modern spaces and ideal on terraces near the house, thanks to its quiet, calming ripple. A new table also joins the Luna range \u2013 with a ball-shaped base that echoes the Luna water feature, it\u2019s available as a round table, or a rectangular one, in two different lengths and a generous width so there\u2019s plenty of space for guests, food and table decorations. A Place in the Garden had their new Porto Planters on display, as well as the new Accessories Sophie Allport\u2018s Chelsea stand is a go-to for anyone who wants a well-dressed garden table with its range of table linens, cushions and accessories. The homeware brand has exclusively partnered with the Royal Hospital Chelsea to launch a limited edition Chelsea Flower Show collection including a mug, tea towel and signed print. 10% of the range\u2019s net sales will go to the charity that looks after the Chelsea Pensioners, readily spotted at the flower show in their iconic red coats. Sophie Allport's exclusive Chelsea Flower Show mug for 2023 Devon-based tool makers Mr Fox\u2019s Garden introduced their new hand rake at Chelsea \u2013 artist designed and sustainably produced, it also made the shortlist for Chelsea\u2019s Sustainable Product of the Year. The handle is made from British oak in a zero-waste workshop that uses only green, renewable energy.","filter_flag":1}

The idea of innovating a sustainable product for the pallet industry is driven by the need to reduce the environmental impact of the industry. Traditionally, the pallet industry has relied heavily on wood and plastic as the primary material for pallets, which has contributed to deforestation and high levels of waste. The innovation of sustainable pallet products seeks to address these issues by using alternative materials and sustainable manufacturing processes that reduce waste and environmental impact. Sustainable pallets are made from post-consumer recycled wood and patented spray. The manufacturing processes for these pallets are designed to minimize waste and energy consumption, with a focus on using renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions. The resulting products are more environmentally friendly than traditional wood pallets, with a lower carbon footprint and reduced waste. Innovation in sustainable pallets also involves the development of new technologies and design features that improve the functionality and durability of the product. For example, hermetically sealed pallets can help prevent moisture damage and increase durability, while pallets made from recycled wood and PU can have increased weight-bearing capability and greater resistance to chemicals and abrasion. Overall, the idea of innovating a sustainable product for the pallet industry is driven by the need to reduce environmental impact while still providing a functional and cost-effective solution for shipping and logistics. By using alternative materials and sustainable manufacturing processes, the pallet industry can reduce waste and improve sustainability while still meeting the needs of customers. 2.

Globally, we need to rethink design to avoid waste products, including reusing materials many times over, and adding value at each step of the supply chain. This will conserve valuable and limited natural resources. We can achieve these shared goals through a circular economy. Our research and innovation will help inform Australia\u2019s modern manufacturing initiative to support the target of tripling Australia\u2019s circularity to contribute $30b by 2030. This aligns with Australia\u2019s resource recovery targets outlined in Australia\u2019s National Waste Plan . Our scope of work will provide researchers, government, industry and communities with innovative science to accelerate a circular economy. This includes developing products, processes and technologies to avoid waste, recover materials, and capture value through reuse, repurposing, recycling and remanufacturing. This will decrease demand on resources and reduce impact to the environment. New circular products from waste resources could provide export opportunities with the potential of a $210 billion economic boost for Australia to 2050. Circular economy principles could support a range of sectors including agriculture, renewable energy, fisheries, forestry, and mining resources to build circularity and turn waste into useful products.","filter_flag":1}

In 2022, Aarti Industries Limited (AIL) sharpened its focus on building a company that is increasingly agile, resilient, and future-ready. The company reached new heights and set aims for bigger milestones in the journey of becoming a world class company. Major milestones achieved during FY 2022-23 are: Catering to the third long-term contract, the company commercialized a new manufacturing unit at Jhagadia. The company anticipates plant expansion and production ramp-up in a phased manner as per the contract terms in the coming quarters. The company secured a binding 20-year term sheet with Deepak Fertilizers worth more than Rs. 8,000 crores, assuring a consistent and sufficient supply of Nitric acid, a crucial raw material used in manufacturing processes. This partnership will begin on April 1, 2023 and will eliminate the need for investment in concentrated Nitric acid backward integration. The company also demerged its Pharma division into a separate listed company called Aarti Pharmalabs Limited, enabling both companies to concentrate on their respective businesses and growth opportunities independently. Capex investment in FY 2022-23 and plans for FY 2023-24. Projects where you are investing? In FY23, we invested Rs. 1,200-1,300 crores in new projects, scaleup activities, asset restoration, debottlenecking, site development, setting up pilot plants and sustainability initiatives. In FY24 and FY25, we plan to invest a total of Rs. 3,000 crores in new chemical value chains and high-potential products to increase the addressable market size and meet the growing demand of key customers. Our upcoming Capex projects include NCB (Nitro Chloro Benzene) capacity expansion and downstream product plants that are expected to start contributing from H1 FY24. Update on commencement of capacity expansion for NCB manufacturing facility at Vapi; Expansion cum asset upgradation for Acid Unit at Vapi; Expansion of Ethylation and NT capacities; and expansion, asset restoration, and sustainability Initiatives planned by the company? Brownfield expansion of the NCB facility at Vapi and a few other Speciality Chemical blocks have been progressing well. These will become operational over the next couple of quarters and start contributing from H2 FY24. We have started the initial work around expanding the Ethylation capacity at Dahej SEZ by 3x with an investment of Rs. 200 crores. Further, with our NT capacities reaching over 90% utilisations, we have commenced the work related to debottlenecking of Nitro Toluene capacities. We target the capacity increase by about 50% with an objective to cater to certain high-growth applications in agrochemicals. We expect both these units to commercialize in H1 FY25. Update on site development work initiated on 100+ acre land at Jhagadia (Zone IV) and when are you planning to commercialize it? Products to be manufactured? The project development work at Zone IV is progressing well, with the pilot plant currently under development. We have received environmental clearance and the facility will manufacture more than 40 products related to the Chlorotoluene value chain which will be commercialized in three phases. Work for Phase - 1 has already begun. The project is expected to be commercialized from H2 FY25 and is likely to contribute significantly to the growth of the company. The project will provide a wide range of locally produced chemicals that are currently imported by the Pharmaceutical and Agrochemical industries. Around 50% of the products will be targeted for the export market. The introduction of new products will extend our value chain advantages further downstream. This will strengthen our relationship with existing customers and create new customer relationships. Additionally, the project will also enhance our chemistry and technology capabilities into newer areas that can be leveraged in the future to further expand product offerings. The company is looking at growth through five pronged strategies - Introducing Chlorotoluenes Value Chain; Setting up Multipurpose Plants (MPP); Newer range of Value Added Products & Other Speciality Chemicals; Manufacturing Outsourcing\/Strategic Alliances; and Custom Manufacturing Opportunities. How will these strategies transform AIL? Earlier in our legacy Benzene value chains, we adopted a sequential approach of adding new products incrementally based on demand from existing or new customers. This meant making incremental investments in upstream and downstream capacities as and when needed. However, for the Chlorotoluene value chain, our strategy is a bit different wherein we have looked at the value chain holistically and planned product capacities in sync across the value chain. This will enable us to be Capex-efficient and facilitate faster ramp-up of capacities once commercialized. The upcoming multipurpose plant will enable Aarti Industries to enter into higher value-added products that will build on its traditional value chain-centric approach. It would also enable faster commercialization of new products and reduce time-to-market (product inquiry\/conception to commissioning). Over the past five years, we have achieved considerable success with our manufacturing outsourcing and long-term contracts that not only provide stable business to the company but also introduce our team to new technologies and global best practices. With the growing trend of China+1 and Europe+1 in the chemical industry, we believe that India is well positioned to attract long-term partnerships from global chemical firms. This will enable us to expand our business and capabilities further while also contributing to the growth of the chemical industry in India. Initiatives for enhancing process safety across all processes? How are you collaborating with business partners to imbibe ESG practices? In order to enhance process safety and ensure zero deviation for sustainable growth, we have taken several initiatives. We have established a dedicated Process Safety team at our corporate and manufacturing locations, and have also set up a world-class infrastructure and research facility - Aarti Research and Technology Center. We have strengthened the Hazards & Operability study procedure by introducing different guidewords, and implementing applicable learning from external process safety incidents. Our process safety audits are conducted with external subject matter experts, and we have also introduced the concept of TACIT Knowledge sharing activities for learning and development. Furthermore, we monitor daily process deviations, interlock bypass, and CAL mode on a daily basis, and have enhanced our Chlorine Handling System across AIL with the help of a Chlorine subject matter expert. We have a robust Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment procedure (HIRA) in place, which is done for each individual activity\/step involved in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Additionally, we conduct process safety studies for existing and new projects, including Thermal Safety Studies (DSC, TSu, RC1e) for all new and existing processes, and Powder Safety studies (MIE, MIT, LIT, Powder Resistivity, etc.) for all new and existing powder handling operations. We also validate process parameters at the pilot and commercial level, and conduct Criticality Class Study, SIL Study, QRA, and HAC study for all commercial plants. We are committed to enhancing our sustainability performance in supply chain by engaging with suppliers on ESG practices. We have prepared a strategy for sustainable supply chain management, in which we screen all existing and potential suppliers on sustainability criteria to identify risk and ensure a sustainable supply chain. We also collaborate closely with our identified high-risk business partners to build their capabilities, strive to imbibe ESG practices in their operations, and encourage them to adopt best practices that align with our sustainability goals. We believe that by working together, we can create a sustainable ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. Sustainability roadmap of Aarti Industries and when are you planning to become Net Carbon Zero? Sustainability plans for FY 2023-24? Aarti Industries is committed to sustainability and has signed the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) commitment. We plan to set targets at the earliest in order to become a Net Carbon Zero company. We have identified a number of initiatives to reduce our energy consumption, including energy efficiency improvement projects and energy loss reduction. In addition, we have invested Rs. 18 crores to source 147 MW\/day of renewable energy which is a significant step towards reducing our carbon footprint. Furthermore, we aim to reduce our carbon footprint by replacing conventional fossil fuels with biomass. Moving ahead in FY 2023-24, we have set our sights on various additional sustainability initiatives, including exploring new technologies for clean energy and continuing to invest in renewable energy sources. We also plan to improve our energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption to become an environmentally responsible company. Through our investments in renewable energy sources and exploration of new technologies, we are well-positioned to achieve sustainability goals in the coming years. CSR initiatives being undertaken by Aarti Industries in FY 2022-23 and plans for FY 2023-24? At AIL, we continue to seek avenues to foster and support the aspirations of communities with a firm belief of touching and transforming lives of people around us. True to our belief that CSR projects must be robust and impactful to bring about transformational changes in the lives of our stakeholders, we collaborate with our trusted partners having strong grassroot presence for executing our CSR interventions. All our community actions are carried out through Aarti Foundation. We do this by focusing on the themes of healthcare, education, and environmental protection. Towards education and skill development, we associated with Shri KVO Jain Mahajan for a project. This project aims to provide interest-free loans, scholarships for higher education and medical aid to the underprivileged. In our endeavor towards upliftment of underprivileged clusters and communities, we have joined hands with Bhansali Trust and took up the Musher Integrated Development Project in Fatehpur, Gaya. This project focuses on education, health and hygiene, microcredit, and nutrition for the villagers. We also contributed to the reconstruction of the school building of Sheth M. P. Rashtriya Shala Trust in Mumbai to promote education. Additionally, we have assisted Matruvandana for the Navneet-Chandravallabh Mahila Arts College to aid needy girl students in completing their graduation and senior citizens in receiving better medical welfare, food, and milk. In FY 2023-24, we plan to continue supporting our current projects. We also aim to strengthen our efforts towards sustainable development. Moreover, we have planned to initiate new projects that align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and make a positive impact on our society. With a commitment to creating long term value for all our stakeholders, we will continue to strive towards achieving CSR goals and positively impact society. Other achievements in FY 2022-23? As a testimony of our commitment towards sustainability, we received following recognition and certifications: Permission to use Responsible Care Logo for a period of 3 years from April 2022 - March 2025; Gold medal in EcoVadis CSR Assessment 2022; Best Environment Friendly Company of the Year at FICCI Chemicals and Petrochemicals Award 2022; Most Innovative Environmental Project Award at the CII National Award for Environmental Best Practices 2022; Platinum Title of 12th Exceed Environment Award 2022 in the category: Environment Preservation; \u201cB\u201d Rating in CDP Climate Change disclosure; \u201cA-\u201d Rating in CDP Supplier Engagement disclosure; For our futuristic approach and readiness to thrive in the age of uncertainty, we were recognized as the Economic Times Future Ready Organisation 2022 in the \u2018Large Category\u2019; and we became the only Indian company to win the Best Supplier Relationship Management Initiative Award during the prestigious CIPS Asia Excellence in Procurement Awards 2022.","filter_flag":1}

Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Corporation contributed US$36.5m to the US$55m equity segment of the funding round, augmenting its initial 2018 investment in M-KOPA. Standard Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation, British International Investment, and Lightrock were among the other prominent participants in the fundraising round. Established in 2010, M-KOPA uses the digital platform to offer products to individuals with limited financial identities and conventional collateral. The company started out by providing pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar energy systems to rural households in Kenya. These kits \u2013 comprising a solar panel, LED lights, a USB phone charger, and a portable solar radio \u2013 are made available to customers against a deposit. The balance is then paid in small instalments via the mobile money platform, M-Pesa. GSM sensors in the equipment allows M-KOPA to regulate usage based on payments received: if a customer stops paying and runs out of credit, the system ceases to function. Over time, M-KOPA widened its offering to include products such as smartphones and health insurance. The company has also expanded into Uganda, Nigeria, and Ghana, selling over 3 million financial products and providing more than US$1bn in cumulative credit since its inception. Sumitomo Corporation has bolstered its interests in Africa's technology and digital sectors. In 2020, it entered a strategic alliance with the UK-based Vodafone and, as part of a global consortium, they secured a new telecoms licence in Ethiopia. This partnership led to the introduction of Safaricom Ethiopia in 2022, making it the first foreign telecom operator to be given license to operate in the country. M-KOPA plans to harness Sumitomo's strategic partnerships to boost its customer growth and reach new markets, including regions where Vodafone operates. Moreover, Sumitomo's broad business networks are anticipated to support M-KOPA in the development of new products and services, such as electric motorbikes and various digital services. The African market for IoT-enabled PAYG household solar systems has ballooned in recent years. Total solar home system (11-50 W) users on the continent grew from 165,000 in 2012 to over 11.6m by 2021, with PAYG currently accounting for about half of sales of these and related products in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the variety of other companies engaged in this sector is Sun King, previously known as Greenlight Planet, which operates in several African countries. Last year, the company garnered an additional US$70m investment, supplementing its initial US$260m Series D round. This extension was led by LeapFrog Investments, a private equity firm in which Singapore's state-backed investor, Temasek, holds a minority stake. Other notable competitors within this field include Bboxx, Zola Electric, Lumos, and Engie. The PAYG technology, initially applied to finance solar energy kits, is now being used across a variety of electronic devices. It is not only enabling consumer finance for products such as smartphones and electric motorbikes, but also underpinning the provision of digital financial services. Moreover, companies are using their PAYG data on customer payments and energy usage to 'cross-sell' new products and services. Many, like M-KOPA, started with one product and progressively added more. For example, Sun King has recently included clean cooking solutions to its product portfolio through the acquisition of Nairobi-based PayGo Energy. The company\u2019s technology uses a PAYG system tied to a smart meter on a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder, allowing customers to buy LPG in affordable instalments. When the customer's credit depletes, the gas supply stops until the next payment.

Presently, a number of securities regulators are focused on whether the sustainable finance claims are accurate and whether investors have the information they need to evaluate sustainable finance products. Retail investors, in particular, need to be able to easily understand the characteristics of such products, as well as the associated risks, to support a more informed investment decision-making process. Recent developments pertaining to sustainable finance in the emerging markets; Demand side: Increasing number of institutional investors are committing to incorporate ESG factors into their investment analysis and decision-making processes Supply side: Constant development in issuance of sustainable instruments (green bonds, social bonds and sustainable bonds) Bloomberg Intelligence (research arm of Bloomberg) has forecasted that the global ESG assets would exceed $53 trillion by the year 2025 and would represent more than a third of the $140.5 trillion in projected total assets under management. Hence, there will be emerging investment flows to the ESG assets in the future, and if enabling frameworks are put in place to facilitate different ESG related new products and initiatives, Sri Lanka would be able to lure much needed foreign inflows to the country in going forward. Sustainable Bonds Sustainable bonds constitute financial instruments aimed at supporting sustainable development by raising capital to finance or re-finance Green or Social or Sustainability-linked projects. In general, Sustainable bonds can be distinguished from regular bonds by the specific use of the funds raised. Thus, in addition to evaluating the standard financial characteristics (such as maturity, coupon, price, and credit quality of the issuer), investors also assess the specific environmental and\/or social purposes of the projects that the bonds intend to support. Types of sustainable bonds; Green Bonds Blue Bonds Climate Bonds Social Bonds Sustainability Bonds What is a Green Bond? Green bonds are innovative financial instruments where the proceeds are invested exclusively (either by specifying the use of the proceeds, direct project exposure, or securitization) in green projects that generate climate or other environmental benefits, for example in renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable waste management, sustainable land use (forestry and agriculture), biodiversity, clean transportation and clean water. Their structure, risk and returns are otherwise identical to those of traditional bonds. Green bonds can mobilize resources from domestic and international Capital Markets for climate change adaptation, renewables and other environment friendly projects. They are no different from conventional bonds, their only unique characteristic being the specification that the proceeds be invested in projects that generate environmental benefits. In its simplest form, a bond issuer will raise a fixed amount of capital, repaying the capital (principal) and accrued interest (coupon) over a set period of time. The issuer will need to generate sufficient cash flows to repay the interest and capital. Qualification Criteria for Green Bonds The International Capital Market Association\u2019s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Climate Bonds Initiative's (CBI) Climate Bond Standards (CBS) help to determine whether a bond qualifies as green or not. Usually, green bonds must undergo a third party verification\/certification to establish that the proceeds are funding projects that generate environmental benefits. The four Green Bonds Principles that define a green bond relate to: Use of proceeds: the issuer should declare the eligible green project categories it intends to support. It should also provide a clear definition of the environmental benefits connected to the project(s) financed by the proceeds. Process for project evaluation and selection: the issuer should outline the investment decision making process it follows to determine the eligibility of individual investments using the green bond\u2019s proceeds. Management of proceeds: the proceeds should be moved to a sub portfolio or otherwise attested to by a formal internal process that should be disclosed. Reporting: the issuer should report at least annually on the investments made from the proceeds, detailing wherever possible the environmental benefits accrued with quantitative\/qualitative indicators. Green Bond Issuances by the Emerging and Developing Economy Segment Cumulative Emerging Market Green Bond Issuances From 2012-2021 ($mn) Source: IFC Global Macro & Market Research, Bloomberg, Environmental Finance, Climate Bonds Initiative Total Return Performance of Global Green Bonds vs. Global Aggregates Source: IFC Global Macro & Market Research, Bloomberg, Environmental Finance, Climate Bonds Initiative Benefits of Issuing Green Bonds Benefits for issuers can include: Improve investor diversification Enhance issuer reputation Provide an additional source of sustainable financing Increase alignment regarding the durability of instruments and the project lifecycle Attract strong investor demand, which can lead to high oversubscription and pricing benefits Can facilitate the establishment of public private partnerships that might accelerate the pace of green investment and lead to the adoption of new technologies. Benefits for investors can include: Comparable financial returns with the addition of environmental and\/or social benefits Satisfy ESG requirements for sustainable investment mandates Contribute to national climate adaptation, food security, public health, energy supply, amongst others Enable direct investment in the \u2018greening\u2019 of brown sectors and social impact activities Increased transparency and accountability on the use and management of proceeds, becoming an additional risk management tool Green bonds can help mitigate climate change-related risks in the portfolio due to changing policies such as carbon taxation which could lead to stranded assets. Instead, a green bond invests in climate-friendly assets, such as green buildings, renewable energy, that over time bear a lower credit risk. Potential for Introducing Green Financing Initiatives in Sri Lanka Presently, more corporate bodies are interested in moving towards green projects\/initiatives in order to ensure sustainable development in their businesses while ensuring the protection of the environment and wellbeing of the society. Green Bonds will broad base investment opportunities available for investors and provide an avenue for the companies who are interested in engaging in green projects. This would offer investment opportunities to groups (both local and foreign) who are interested in investing in green projects which would benefit the overall Capital Market. In year 2022, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) launched a green taxonomy in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) that defines and categorizes economic activities that are environmentally sustainable, and would aide in providing a holistic strategy to integrate sustainability into the country\u2019s financial system. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is already registered under the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative and is currently working on ESG related initiatives under the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). The SSE initiative provides a peer to peer learning platform for exploring how exchanges in collaboration with investors, regulators, and companies can encourage sustainable investment and enhance corporate transparency, and performance on ESG. Steps Taken by the SEC for Introducing Green Bonds and Facilitating Sustainable Finance Initiatives The introduction of Green Bonds to the Sri Lankan Capital Market would enable listed entities to raise capital for Green projects adhering to international principles applicable. This would not only expand the supply side but also open up avenue for getting much needed foreign inflows to the country from foreign funds. Moreover, in June 2022 to enhance the awareness building initiatives in relation to ESG, a MOU was signed between the SEC, CSE and the Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) Society. The MOU broadly intended to establish a collaborative relationship to promote awareness of ESG among Sri Lankan investors to enhance investor protection, encourage capital market practitioners to introduce ESG into their investment research and valuation process to keep abreast with challenging global trends and ensure that the professional standards and integrity are maintained in the Sri Lankan capital market. In August 2022, to promote ESG reporting by listed companies, the SEC, CSE and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) entered in to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which broadly covered areas on building awareness on integrated reporting, corporate governance, sustainability and any other related areas for the benefit of corporates and the users of financial statements\/corporate reports. In addition the SEC developed a policy and regulatory framework governing Green Bonds in consultation with Technical Experts from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the CSE and in April 2023, the SEC Commission approved rules for issuing Green Bonds. Presently, the CSE under the guidance of the SEC is completing the groundwork for launching a green index. A green index would help investors assess and integrate sustainable financing considerations in their investment process and portfolio.","filter_flag":1}

Creating new investment opportunities and markets away from hydrocarbon will propel entrepreneurship and drive Qatar\u2019s economic diversification ambitions, Dean of Qatar University College of Business and Economics, Prof Rana Sobh, has said. In an interview with The Peninsula, Prof Sobh noted that developing new products, services, and technology, generating new wealth, job opportunities and reduced dependence on public sector jobs are ways that the country can encourage a culture of entrepreneurship and economic independence of citizens. \u201cQatar\u2019s economic diversification drive is focused on creating a more resilient and sustainable economy by reducing its reliance on the oil and gas industry and developing new industries and sectors. \u201cThe country has invested heavily in developing a knowledge-based economy, promoting tourism, developing the SMEs sector, building human capital, and investing in renewable energy. These initiatives aim at creating new jobs, businesses, and opportunities for economic growth and sustainable development,\u201d she added. Qatar\u2019s commitment to diversifying its economy is a top priority for the government, particularly as many investments and strategies towards boosting other sectors like tourism, communications and IT, as well as financial services, have increased. Qatar has also expanded investment in renewable energy as part of its sustainability approach and economic boost. According to Prof Sobh, Qatar is taking a crucial step towards achieving sustainable development by pursuing economic diversification. She said a more diversified economy would better withstand fluctuations in oil and gas prices and changes in global demand for fossil fuels while promoting social and environmental sustainability. She said: \u201cThis will help to ensure long-term economic growth and development, as well as create a more resilient and sustainable future for Qatar.\u201d In 2021, Qatar was ranked ninth on the list of top countries for entrepreneurs according to the National Entrepreneurial Context Index (NECI). According to the report, Qatar\u2019s position is strengthened due to the country\u2019s successful national development strategies, which support and promote new businesses and especially encourage female entrepreneurs. At QU, the Center for Entrepreneurship & Organizational Excellence (CEOE) aims to impact how organisations in Qatar conduct business and how their business affects the country by conducting outstanding research and policy works, experiential learning, distinctive capacity building, and community outreach. \u201cGiven that Qatar, along with the rest of the region, is at the heart of developing a booming entrepreneurial hub that fosters sustainability and innovation, we inspire to create and apply new knowledge and to be engaged in value-added activities that contribute to enhancing organisational excellence, sustainable development and societal impact,\u201d Prof Sobh noted.","filter_flag":1}
