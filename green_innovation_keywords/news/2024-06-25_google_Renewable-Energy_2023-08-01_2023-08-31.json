Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy. Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels. A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely. Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world\u2019s largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric. As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet. 1 2 3 4 A big shift in the way America produces energy is already underway. Continue scrolling The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries. \u201cWe look at energy data on a daily basis, and it\u2019s astonishing what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. \u201cClean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it\u2019s become turbocharged lately.\u201d More than $1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year. Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.

By The New York Times \u201cThe nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating,\u201d said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a \u201cplanetary crisis\u201d 17 years ago in his film \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d \u201cThe trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy.\u201d Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad. Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy. The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States \u2014 all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced \u2014 is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels. And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels. And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country. \u2018Energy Is Energy\u2019 As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country\u2019s second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa\u2019s School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source. Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the \u201cOil Capital of the World\u201d where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution. At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city\u2019s main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind. 1 2 3 4 5 Even Tulsa, with its strong links to oil and gas, is embracing clean energy. Continue scrolling Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa. The city is embracing its shifting identity. \u201cWe have a tremendous sense of pride in our history,\u201d said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. \u201cBut we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be.\u201d Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales. Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country\u2019s largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston. In Arkansas, a planned solar farm \u2014 the state\u2019s biggest \u2014 is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter. About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics. \u201cWe\u2019re the reddest state in the country, and we\u2019re an oil and gas state,\u201d said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. \u201cSo it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn\u2019t snake oil.\u201d Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $18 million in annual sales. \u201cThe environmental benefits are nice,\u201d he said, \u201cbut most people are doing this for the financial opportunity.\u201d \u2018Something Very Dramatic\u2019 Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use. But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades. Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power \u2014 some $380 billion \u2014 than into drilling for oil.

Lazard did not release data for 2022. In 2023, costs rose because of supply-chain problems, inflation and other issues. By The New York Times The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world. \u201cThe world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process,\u201d said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAnd all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic.\u201d An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money \u2014 in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies. In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history. 1 2 3 4 5 The United States is ramping up its capacity to produce electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. Continue scrolling That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air. Originally estimated to cost roughly $391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $1.2 trillion over the next decade. Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law,\u201d said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act. Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 \u2014 and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas. Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race. 1 2 3 Clean energy investments are generating thousands of new jobs. Continue scrolling Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels. And in China, which is currently both the world\u2019s top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world. With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year. And those low costs have led many of the United States\u2019 biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the nonlinear change happen before us,\u201d said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. \u201cAnd that\u2019s important, because we\u2019re facing a climate crisis right now.\u201d \u2018A National Phenomenon\u2019 Steve Uerling\u2019s Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3. Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet. \u201cMy fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity.\u201d Electric Cars Are Gaining Momentum Electric models as percentage of total passenger vehicle sales 30% 25% 20% sales 15% 10% U.S. E.U.

By The New York Times Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list. Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost. Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks \u2014 roughly 30 percent of its fleet \u2014 over the next five years. 1 2 3 Electric vehicles sales are growing quickly, but consumers are still concerned about high upfront costs and charging availability. Continue scrolling In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt. Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates. \u201cIt is not a red-state, blue-state thing,\u201d said Cathy Zoi, EVgo\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is a national phenomenon.\u201d In an unusual move, seven carmakers \u2014 BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis \u2014 are spending $1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada. The shift is happening so quickly that some of America\u2019s most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks. General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It\u2019s a \u201conce-in-a-generation inflection point\u201d for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive. In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. \u201cWe started to see this happening with the consumer research we did,\u201d said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.\u2019s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants. As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be definitely an upward trajectory,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Our workshops give students the foundations of building science, teach networking skills, and create mentorship connections with industry professionals \u2013 with the goal of recruiting new talent and bringing greater diversity to the clean energy industry workforce. The Growing Need for a Clean Energy Workforce The clean energy industry is a growing economy in need of skilled workers. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the pace of growth has increased, and millions of clean energy jobs will be created over the next decade. Our industry needs an expansive workforce to carry out this long-term transition from fossil-fuel based systems to efficient, renewable, and decarbonized energy systems. A diverse workforce will make this energy transformation not only more equitable, but more successful and far-reaching. Diverse perspectives generate more effective and innovative solutions that meet the needs of a more diverse set of communities and customers. But barriers exist for recruiting underrepresented communities in the clean energy field, including lack of awareness of available career options and limited opportunities for education and training. Recruiting Early: High School Training Workshops TRC and our clients are working to expand the clean energy workforce by spreading the word to potential future employees at a young age: we\u2019re partnering with local high schools and offering Clean Energy Skills Workshops to students in communities where we work. These workshops have a threefold purpose: 1) educate students on prospective clean energy careers; 2) provide building science and business education to students from different disciplines; and 3) teach networking skills and create opportunities for mentorship with professionals within our industry. By offering these classes to students with both science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concentrations and non-STEM interests, we hope to engage a wide range of potential future workers in our industry. And by offering skills training in energy and non-energy subjects, including engineering, business operations, marketing, contracting, and general networking skills, we\u2019re helping students visualize themselves in the many important roles that support the clean energy industry. Clean Energy Workshops in Action: Brooklyn and Los Angeles TRC and our partners recently offered clean energy workshops to students at high schools in Brooklyn, NY and Los Angeles, CA. At Brooklyn\u2019s High School for Enterprise, Business, and Technology, TRC employees presented a four-day workshop on clean energy skill-building, including educational sessions on renewable energy, energy auditing, data analysis, marketing, and job-seeking skills. This hands-on workshop for 11th and 12th graders created rapport between students and guest teachers and concluded with a networking session where clean energy professionals from Brooklyn spoke about their personal journeys. As part of the workshop, TRC coordinated a field trip for Solar One, a New York City-based community solar organization, to teach students about careers in the solar industry and provide hands-on experience with a renewable energy technology installation in the field. For the networking portion of the workshop, local energy experts from Trane, Agarabi Engineering, and United Energy Advisors gave insights on entrepreneurship and career opportunities in the energy contracting field.","filter_flag":1}

The high cost of National grid power also has pushed people to alternative sources and solar energy has come up on the top being for solar water heating, borehole pumping, backup solutions, hybrid and off-grid solutions. Some of the difficulties experienced include shifting government policies that have been unstable making the market unpredictable, low quality products especially decommissioned and dumped products especially from western markets, marketed as new products affecting efficiency and life span, which affects the market confidence and transfers the solar waste to the country How does your company engage with local communities in Kenya to ensure that the benefits of solar technology reach those who need it the most? A few government initiatives have had positive effects on the uptake of solar solutions in the country; -The government\u2019s drive to 100% green power on the National grid by 2030 has helped in creating awareness across the country. Without awareness, the conversion would remain a greater issue. -Tax incentives including exemption on importation of some components unavailable locally -Legislative initiative requiring installation of solar water heaters for houses with more than 2 bedrooms, This has caused investors to add solar water heating in the construction budget as one of the requirements by buyers. Through these initiatives, new homeowners are buying houses already with solar installed further easing uptake. In your experience, what role do you see the Kenyan people playing in driving the adoption of solar technology? Are there any notable success stories or examples of community involvement? -Kenyan People\/the market has started demanding quality products with enforceable warranties. There is a market pull for quality with the middle and high-end market becoming less price sensitive and more quality driven. This pull will eliminate naturally the poor quality products in the market making solar more reliable -Nearly all manufacturers in the country (big power consumers) have adopted hybrid solar systems that enable them to lower their power bills by more than half. This lowers their cost of production and the many staff members who are working in the companies get to appreciate that the systems do work. Where we have installed solutions in companies and institutions, we have noted a spike in demand from the staff members for their homes within the first 2 years of commissioning. -Solar mini-grids have been developed on community levels to supply power to a village through their mostly through their elected representatives. Can you share any innovative technological solutions or advancements your company has implemented to overcome specific challenges in the Kenyan market? High initial capital outlay. This remains as the biggest hindrance to the adoption of solar solutions. to overcome this, Metrocart undertakes a thorough evaluation of the energy needs, starts by recommending saving actions like retrofitting of lower power consumers\u2019 bulbs, compressors etc. With this, the client can save on running costs even before the adoption of solar, we then work with the client\u2019s available funds and offer a modular system that can be grown over a period of time through savings generated.

Sustainable construction: Developing more sustainable homes, buildings, and infrastructure, including leveraging the country\u2019s strong position in biogenic building materials. Low carbon energy system: Capitalising on New Zealand\u2019s highly renewable electricity system to attract low-carbon industry and enable the net zero transition through electrification of transport, heat, and industrial processes. Sustainable food production: Producing world-leading natural and sustainable food through premium product development, aggressive investment in R&D to reduce agricultural emissions, and adoption of best practice technologies to improve productivity. Green consumer products: Developing premium retail products with lower environmental impact, transparent supply chains enabled by digitisation, and clear sustainability metrics to attract a growing segment of customers that value sustainability. 1. Eco-tourism Tourism is a vital part of New Zealand\u2019s economy. Domestic tourism expenditure has remained relatively stable at $25 billion per year from pre-COVID levels to current levels in the year ended March 2023. 1 1 Stats NZ, 2023, Tourism satellite account: Year ended March 2023 Notes: 1 Stats NZ, 2023, Tourism satellite account: Year ended March 2023 However, international tourism expenditure declined by ~90% during COVID from NZD$18 billion per year pre-COVID to NZD$2 billion in the year ended March 2022. As a result, tourism fell from ~20% of New Zealand\u2019s exports to just 2%. The most recent data is brighter international tourism levels in March 2023 were ~20% below pre-COVID levels. As New Zealand emerges from the pandemic, eco-tourism is an opportunity to reinvigorate the tourism sector and the 100% Pure New Zealand brand. According to Tourism New Zealand data, people actively considering travel to New Zealand score the country highly on its pristine landscapes and scenery, and connection to the land relative to other destinations. 2 2 Tourism New Zealand, 2023, Active Considerer reports Notes: 2 Tourism New Zealand, 2023, Active Considerer reports Two global trends are changing the nature of tourism Rise in eco-tourism: Consumer awareness of the environmental footprint of their travel is on the rise, with 81% of travellers stating that sustainable travel is important. 3 3 Corporate Traveller, 2022, Sustainability in Travel: How to Make a Positive Impact Notes: 3 Corporate Traveller, 2022, Sustainability in Travel: How to Make a Positive Impact 36% of travellers stated they would be willing to pay up to 10% more for air travel with a lower carbon footprint. 4 4 Statista, 2020, Willingness to pay more for a flight with smaller environmental impact Notes: 4 Statista, 2020, Willingness to pay more for a flight with smaller environmental impact Demand for premium travel: Consumers are looking for more premium travel experiences. The average spend per traveller in New Zealand grew by 18% in the last three years. 5 5 Tourism New Zealand, 2023, Tourism data Notes: 5 Tourism New Zealand, 2023, Tourism data Many travellers that are seeking premium tourism experiences also want these experiences to be environmentally sustainable. The global eco-tourism industry is forecast to grow to NZD$700 billion by 2030, 6 6 imarc Group, 2022, \u201cEcotourism Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast\u201d Notes: 6 imarc Group, 2022, \u201cEcotourism Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast\u201d at 14% per year. New Zealand is well placed to build a more prosperous and sustainable eco- tourism industry that meets these changing consumer needs. New Zealand can harness the rise in eco-tourism Support sustainable air travel for international visitors to New Zealand: For most international travellers, New Zealand is a remote destination which is a potential threat to the tourism industry as concerns over the carbon footprint of air miles rise. In the future, potential visitors to New Zealand may choose a destination closer to home if air travel to the country is not sustainable. Anticipating this changing consumer preference, Air New Zealand has committed to at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 and has set a target for net zero emissions by 2050. 7 7 Air New Zealand, Flight NZ0\u2122 Notes: 7 Air New Zealand, Flight NZ0\u2122 Policy support for decarbonising international travel to New Zealand is likely to be required to protect New Zealand\u2019s tourism industry over the longer term. Drive low environmental footprint tourism within New Zealand: While improving sustainable travel to New Zealand is vital, it is also important to ensure tourism within the country becomes more sustainable. Low-emissions domestic transport options include e-bike rentals, electric hire car hires, electric buses, electric trains, and sustainable domestic flights. Sustainable accommodation and environmentally friendly tourist experiences are also important. A number of initiatives are underway, such as Waka Kotahi, New Zealand\u2019s leading transport agency, facilitating a nationwide network of fast charging stations for electric vehicles every 75 km along state highways. 8 8 NZ Transport Agency, 2022, National guidance for public electric vehicle charging infrastructure Notes: 8 NZ Transport Agency, 2022, National guidance for public electric vehicle charging infrastructure Additionally, the tourism industry\u2019s 12 Tourism Sustainability Commitments, including nature restoration and waste elimination, have been signed by over 1,800 businesses across New Zealand. 9 9 Tourism Industry Aotearoa, 2023, Tourism Sustainability Commitments Directory Notes: 9 Tourism Industry Aotearoa, 2023, Tourism Sustainability Commitments Directory Make the most of New Zealand\u2019s natural environment: Natural attractions are one of the primary reasons tourists visit New Zealand, and while consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious, they are also looking for more premium eco-tourism services and experiences \u2013 and they are willing to pay more for them. International visitors to New Zealand are generally enchanted by its natural beauty, and there is an opportunity to consider how this can be further leveraged to reinvigorate the tourism industry. 2. Sustainable Construction Construction is a major part of New Zealand\u2019s economy, contributing NZD$21 billion (7% of GDP) in 2019 and employing 275,000 workers (10% of the workforce). 10 10 Construction Sector Accord NZ, 2021, Construction Sector Accord Progress Report Notes: 10 Construction Sector Accord NZ, 2021, Construction Sector Accord Progress Report Adoption of sustainable construction materials in New Zealand will result in an increasingly low-carbon built environment. New Zealand already has a unique advantage in this area due to its leading position in biogenic building materials. The environmental impact of residential housing in New Zealand is 16 kg CO 2 eq\/m2\/year, roughly one-third of the international median of 50 kg CO 2 eq\/m2\/year, predominantly driven by the use of more wooden materials in New Zealand. 11 11 Buildings, Dani et al., 2022, \u201cA Comparative Study on the Life Cycle Assessment of New Zealand Residential Buildings\u201d, p.3 Notes: 11 Buildings, Dani et al., 2022, \u201cA Comparative Study on the Life Cycle Assessment of New Zealand Residential Buildings\u201d, p.3","filter_flag":1}

Honda is advancing a recycling initiative that takes uniforms worn by associates at its U.S. manufacturing and R&D facilities and transforms them into sound-absorbing insulation for use in Honda and Acura automobiles. This program diverts approximately 45,000 pounds of uniforms from reaching landfills each month as Honda works toward its commitment to use 100% sustainable materials in its products in the future. Watch a video of the uniform recycling process at https:\/\/honda.us\/UniformRecycling. Honda has established a global \"Triple Action to Zero\" approach, with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, use of 100% clean energy and resource circulation (100% sustainable materials), by 2050. Achieving that goal \u2013 which targets zero environmental impact \u2013 will require innovative solutions, including how Honda sources materials for new products by recycling and reusing material from end-of-life vehicles and Honda operations. \"To achieve our Triple Zero goal of 100% sustainable material use, we need to take every possible opportunity to recycle materials at end of life for reuse in our products, thereby minimizing our utilization of virgin materials,\" said Negar Gilsinger, manager of Resource Circulation for American Honda Motor Co., Inc. \"By maximizing end-of-life material recycling, we are giving our uniforms a second life in Honda and Acura vehicles.\" The Honda uniform recycling program leverages cross-industry collaboration between Honda and its uniform suppliers Aramark and Cintas Corporation, as well as insulation supplier UGN Automotive and textile recycler Leigh Fibers. Uniforms from Honda production and R&D facilities in Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio are recycled and reused in five different insulator parts on all nine Honda and four Acura models made in North America. In the future, Honda plans to expand the uniform recycling program to other facilities in North America. \"Collaborating with Honda suppliers in the uniform recycling program has brought great value to our supply chain sustainability efforts,\" said Rob Long, senior procurement specialist with Honda North American Indirect Procurement. \"As Honda works to advance sustainability, we appreciate our suppliers' efforts to innovate their business operations to reduce waste and give new life to our Honda uniforms.\" More than 380,000 pounds of uniforms have been recycled since the program launched at the end of 2021. The uniforms Honda associates wear have always been an important part of the company's culture and success, symbolizing Honda's \"One Team\" approach, which promotes collaboration and the understanding that the ideas of all associates are valued. Transforming Uniforms into Insulation Honda associate uniforms that are cleaned by uniform suppliers \u2013 Aramark, at Honda Indiana and Ohio facilities, and Cintas Corporation, at Alabama and North Carolina facilities \u2013 are evaluated after washing. If the uniforms are undamaged, they are sent back to associates to wear. When uniforms are designated for reuse in Honda and Acura vehicles, they are baled and sent to Leigh Fibers, which specializes in reprocessing and custom-blending fiber-based materials. At Leigh Fibers' facility, the uniforms are shredded into material that meets the required fiber grade for use as vehicle insulators. Zippers and buttons from the uniforms are first extracted and collected so that no metal or plastic goes through the shredding process. Then the material gets blended into mixed fibers and tested to ensure the fiber material meets the fiber length requirements. The newly reprocessed fibers are then packaged and delivered to insulation supplier UGN. UGN blends, consolidates and trims the fibers into material that is molded into insulation and returned to Honda auto manufacturing plants for new vehicle production. Typically, UGN creates insulation from post-industrial fibers, which are sourced from textile companies, and polyester sourced from recycled water bottles. The uniform recycling program marks the first time Honda and UGN are using post-consumer textile waste for sustainable insulation material. \"It is part of UGN's history and culture to maximize recycled content in our parts, reduce landfill by recycling our own by-products, and promote circular, mono-material technologies that enable end-of-life vehicle recycling,\" said Pranav Singh, director of Purchasing & Packaging for UGN Automotive. \"Reusing Honda uniforms contributes to these efforts by increasing the amount of recycled materials available for insulators and opens the door to other post-consumer textile waste projects.\" Expanding Recycled Materials in Vehicles The uniform recycling program builds on Honda's longstanding commitment to reduce waste and incorporate higher recycled content in Honda and Acura vehicles. This includes working with suppliers to transform post-industrial textile scrap, such as fibers from denim, into vehicle insulation\/absorption material. In collaboration with UGN, Honda annually reuses approximately 2,800 tons of recycled post-industrial textile waste \u2013 equivalent to 5.6 million pairs of jeans \u2013 and 3,000 tons of post-consumer PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles \u2013 equivalent to 6 million water bottles \u2013 for vehicle sound-absorbing insulation. Other approaches to using sustainable materials in Honda and Acura vehicles have included soybean-based foam for vehicle headrests, recycled plastic water bottles and recycled Honda car bumpers for wheel liners, plant-based material for the seat fabric in the 2019 Acura RDX and Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid vehicle, and processed volcanic rocks for the roof liner in the 2003 Honda Element. To learn more about Honda's Triple Action to Zero approach and the concept of resource circulation, read Our Perspective, \"We Have Set a Great Big Goal: Nothing.\" About Honda's Commitment to the Environment Honda is working toward its global goal of zero environmental impact by 2050 through its \"Triple Action to Zero\" approach, including achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, 100% utilization of renewable energy, and resource circulation, utilizing 100% sustainable materials by reprocessing products back to raw materials and reusing those materials in the creation of new products. Toward this goal, Honda will strive to make battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles represent 100% of auto sales in the U.S. and globally by 2040. To reduce the environmental impact of its business operations, Honda also is offsetting CO2 emissions from its North American manufacturing operations through long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for renewable wind and solar power that seek to cover more than 60% of the electricity Honda uses in North America. Honda also promotes environmentally responsible business practices with its suppliers and retail dealer partners across North America. # # #","filter_flag":1}

Logitech is dedicated to removing more carbon than it produces, aiming to achieve climate positive by 2030. Since 2019, Logitech has reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 56% and its carbon intensity has decreased by 74%. Scope 3 value chain emissions have reduced by more than 21% since 2021. \u201cAs part of our long-term journey toward climate positivity, our 15th Impact Report illustrates how our teams, including our value chain partners, are making meaningful progress on lifecycle carbon reductions,\u201d said Prakash Arunkundrum, chief operating officer at Logitech. \u201cOur Design for Sustainability approach continues to scale, accelerating the transition to lower impact materials and circular alternatives across our product portfolio.\u201d Designing for Sustainability is a catalyst for reducing negative environmental impact and elevating social impact. Because sourcing materials and the manufacturing of Logitech products comprises 65% of the company\u2019s entire carbon footprint, moving to renewable energy, partnering with suppliers, and focusing on removing and reducing hidden impacts early in the design process are critical to achieving the company\u2019s climate goals. Highlights from this year's report include the following: Nearly two in three (2:3) products now use post consumer recycled plastic, lowering carbon and environmental impact across the portfolio. Over 50% of new products have FSC TM -certified packaging and 11% of all Logitech products use FSC TM -certified packaging, an initiative that not only supports the transition away from single-use plastic packaging, but ensures paper packaging is certified from responsibly managed sources. -certified packaging and 11% of all Logitech products use FSC -certified packaging, an initiative that not only supports the transition away from single-use plastic packaging, but ensures paper packaging is certified from responsibly managed sources. Logitech is transparent about its entire scope of impact and pledged to carbon label its products, holding itself accountable for reducing the entire scope of that impact. 42% of Logitech products shipped in 2022 had a product carbon footprint label compared to 17% in 2021. Logitech increasingly chooses materials made using renewable energy. 43 product lines use low carbon aluminum for lower carbon impact. Logitech facilities across the globe are powered by 94% renewable electricity and it is driving greater adoption of renewable energy within its supply chain with its renovated Renewable Electricity Buyer\u2019s Program. Collaborative efforts with suppliers to match energy consumption with renewable electricity certificates led to over 75,000 tCO2 carbon savings. Logitech neutralized its entire carbon emissions across operations and its scope 3 value chain for the second year in a row. \u201cThe programs across Logitech aim to advance the positive impact we can have on individuals, communities, and society,\u201d said Kirsty Russell, head of people and culture at Logitech. \u201cIn particular, we have taken an accelerated approach to addressing the barriers that keep people from accessing inclusive technology. Creating programs that challenge existing stereotypes and enable all people to work, create, and play will make everyone successful.\u201d The company co-founded the Coalition for Gender Fair Procurement and adopted a new standard for gender equality in the procurement process by introducing Gender Fair\u2019s Assessment Methodology. Logitech continues to elevate programs and products that promote equity and inclusivity in communities throughout the world. Logitech\u2019s Aurora Product Collection and the Adaptive E-Sports Tournament were intentionally designed to challenge existing biases and stereotypes, enhancing inclusivity in gaming. Logitech\u2019s FY23 Impact Report was developed with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standard, recommendations outlined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and in alignment with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Rapidly increasing global demand for hydrogen is also driving up demand for clean, green hydrogen production, which in turn requires vast amounts of green energy, electrolysers and peripheral electrical equipment. \"We are delighted to play a significant and enabling role in the growing hydrogen sector offering leading-edge advisory services and technologies to accelerate the energy transition,\" said Marco Berardi, Head of Grid & Power Quality Solutions and Service business at Hitachi Energy. \"Our solutions for the hydrogen sector support the generation of efficient and reliable clean energy. On the one hand, we offer world-class expertise in connecting electrolyser systems to the grid, and on the other, we are driving innovation in clean power generation leveraging hydrogen fuel cell technology.\" Power-to-Hydrogen There are several ways of producing hydrogen with varying carbon intensity. Water electrolysis uses an electrolyser and an electric current to split fresh water into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity used in this process comes exclusively from renewable sources like wind or solar, the hydrogen produced is called green hydrogen. Most hydrogen today is produced by reforming fossil fuels like gas or coal. These processes emit large amounts of CO 2 , while water electrolysis utilizing renewable energy produces a nearly CO 2 -free form of hydrogen. Green hydrogen is a new and complementing component in the electrification space, where Hitachi Energy can add substantial value and innovation. With vast domain expertise in grid connection and power quality solutions, it develops groundbreaking technologies that enable renewables integration, high power quality and reliable and resilient power grids. \"We expand in new directions to support customers with crucial innovations to meet the needs of the evolving global clean energy transition and offer advanced and proven solutions to connect high-power (>20 MW) electrolysers to the high-voltage grid,\" said Berardi. \u201cWe focus on optimizing the complete power supply system, from early-stage techno-economic studies and advise to grid connection and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) down to stack terminals and O&M software which increases your system performance.\u201d Hydrogen and renewable electricity are vital in the energy transition. For instance, a green value chain can supply clean fuel for heavy transport and supports hard-to-abate industries, such as steel, fertilizers, chemicals and oil and gas to lower their carbon footprint. It can also electrify remote construction sites, and provide clean backup power where it is needed. At all project phases, Hitachi Energy optimizes the costs, footprint, and efficiency of green hydrogen projects and helps remove the risk of not being grid-code compliant. Hydrogen-to-Power The restrictions on the use of fossil fuels are forcing us to rethink the status quo. To address this need, new products under development include a hydrogen power generator, based on zero-emission fuel cell technology. In 2021, Hitachi Energy and PowerCell agreed to collaborate on fuel cell-based power solutions contributing to the green energy transition. Hydrogen power generators are a disruptive replacement technology for carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based generators such as diesel gensets. A key feature of hydrogen is its capacity to store energy over long periods and convert it back to power when needed.

This can cause competition for internal resources, talent and attention, rather than bringing the necessary pieces together to address interconnected issues. Stripped to their basics, circularity and decarbonization are both about reducing the negative externalities of our economic system. Even in the fundamental principles of circularity \u2014 eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value, regenerate nature \u2014 we see connections to decarbonization. Decarbonization, when taken to mean reducing emissions, is embedded in that first principle of circularity. Efforts to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and recarbonize soil and vegetation are inherently circular solutions that help regenerate nature. Circularity and decarbonization strategies have significant overlap. To uncover some of the links, I spoke to Ke Wang, program director at Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). The self-described \"physicist turned sustainability professional\" turns the knowledge built by PACE and its partners into circular public-private collaborations across a wide range of industries. We started by discussing the report \"Completing the picture: How the circular economy tackles climate change\" from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It posits that efforts to improve energy efficiency and transition to renewable energy can only address 55 percent of global emissions. The other 45 percent of emissions come from the sourcing and manufacturing of consumer goods, the development of the built environment, the production and transportation of food and how we manage land. She described these two sides of global emissions as the \"operational energy use\" of all the fuels used to power transportation and buildings as opposed to emissions from extracting, processing and manufacturing \"the stuff that we use and consume every day.\" Circularity has a big role to play in supporting the clean energy transition. Kori Goldberg: So let\u2019s dive into the operational energy side. How can circularity help address this 55 percent of global GHG emissions? Wang: Circularity has a big role to play in supporting the clean energy transition. Solar PV, wind turbines, EV batteries \u2014 all reduce fossil fuel-based emissions but these technologies are very material and mineral heavy. The International Energy Agency has forecasted that if we are to scale these clean energy technologies at the speed needed to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius, the total demand for minerals will far exceed today's supply capacity. The material side is a big bottleneck for the energy transition. So this is where circularity can play an important role. We can reduce the demand for critical minerals and alleviate some of the supply pressure required for the energy transition. Goldberg: And now the other 45 percent: extracting, processing and manufacturing\u2026 Wang: So if you look at these material-related emissions, this comes mostly from the production of stuff \u2026 for example, for some electronics, three-quarters of the emission comes from the manufacturing phase alone. Circularity kind of boils down to \"reduce, reuse and recycle\"; all just strategies to reduce societal demand for virgin raw materials and new products. Circular strategies that reduce the demand for raw materials and new products subsequently reduce GHG emissions from production. Goldberg: What specific circular strategies are called out in the literature as the best avenues to achieve decarbonization targets? Wang: There are many articles in this space, but most of them can be traced back to just three bigger, more comprehensive reports: one from International Resource Panel; one from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation; and a third from Circle Economy. Circular strategies that reduce the demand for raw materials and new products subsequently reduce GHG emissions from production. Well, when we looked into those reports, although they may disagree on the numbers, they do agree qualitatively on which circularity measures have the highest GHG reduction potential. And those are not recycling strategies; those are more upstream measures that focus specifically on consumption patterns, reducing overconsumption and more efficient design. Upstream circularity strategies can achieve synergistic carbon reductions. For example, reducing total floor area reduces embedded carbon and emissions from heating and cooling; lightweight vehicle design reduces embedded carbon and emissions from fuel usage. Goldberg: Reporting on circularity is very minimal compared to GHG reporting. But essentially both reporting on circularity and GHG emissions are asking: What are your inputs, where are they coming from? How are they being managed, and where do they go? First off, what makes reporting on circularity so different from GHG reporting? Wang: First, the indicator itself: For GHG emissions, the indicator is simple and unified \u2014 CO2 equivalent. It's one unit that can be used by everybody. That simplifies measurement, comparing apples to apples. For circularity, it's not so simple...We measure both inputs and outputs in tonnage, but this doesn't say anything about, for example, how hazardous a material is or the scarcity of the material or the carbon footprint. Just simply looking at tonnage, we should prioritize washing machines, right? There's tons of concrete inside. But in terms of value, mobile phones have a lot more critical minerals. Unlike greenhouse gas emissions, there's a very clear global target on temperature, and also on the total emission budget. And for circularity, we don't have that yet. Challenge No. 2 is: Unlike greenhouse gas emissions, there's a very clear global target on temperature, and also on the total emission budget. And for circularity, we don't have that yet. There are research groups like the International Resource Panel, which are actually actively working with a large group of scientists on it. But even scientifically, there's no consensus yet of what the target should be. Goldberg: How have circular metrics changed in recent years? Wang: Literally hundreds of metrics have been developed. For the past few years PACE has hosted the Circular Economy Indicator Coalition with the intention to help metric developers talk to each other and to see if, longer term, we can consolidate, but we're not there yet. There are so many indicators out there, it can be confusing for companies to choose what to track. Earlier this year, working with Accenture, we launched circular target-setting guidance for companies. We try to boil down the hundreds of indicators to maybe a dozen, but it's still quite a few compared to GHG emissions. I've seen some companies start using material footprint per EBITA \u2014 so, basically, how much material they use, normalized to their profit. That might be a good kind of umbrella indicator. Goldberg: What does the integration of circularity and decarbonization mean for the likelihood of success for both these efforts? Can connecting these two issues increase the attention and resources given to both? Wang: This is a need we have spotted at PACE, which has led to a new program called Integrating Circularity with Climate Measures. So we intend to do exactly that. We have observed this siloed campaigning or advocacy between circularity and decarbonization, and we think if we bring the two closer together, we can achieve more. We still need the science to give more guidance of exactly how and there are efforts in that direction \u2014 for example, the Circular Transition Indicator work by WBCSD. They're already in their fourth edition, looking at how circularity indicators can be connected to GHG emissions. There are ongoing active efforts, and hopefully we\u2019ll get there soon enough.","filter_flag":1}

Solar modules are put through a variety of accelerated stress tests to evaluate these parameters. Through comparative test results, project stakeholders can select products best suited for a particular environment, location, or portfolio. Quality Hail durability Top performers: JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar RETC\u2019s hail durability test takes UL and IEC standards testing a step further, exposing solar modules to higher kinetic impact to reflect the risk posed by hail over a 25 or 30-year operating life. In addition to ballistic impact testing, RETC runs thermal cycle and hot-spot tests to reveal potential long-term module degradation. The top eight performers in this category withstood an effective kinetic energy of 20 Joules or more. These modules effectively demonstrated resistance to a 45 mm (1.8 in.) iceball traveling at a terminal velocity of 30.7 m\/s (68.7 mph). Thresher Test Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar Longi Solar, Runergy The thresher test is a summation of a series of tests that places modules under a variety of vigorous environmental stresses to provide quantitative data behind degradation modes. Power drop, leakage current and visual observations are also made in the test. The RETC test places backsheets, modules, and connectors through accelerated stresses. Thresher tests include humidity-freeze cycling, thermal cycling, damp heat exposure, static and dynamic load testing, and UV soaking. High performers in this category consistently achieved less than 2% of power degradation. Performance LeTID resistance Top performers: Aptos Solar, Astronergy, JA Solar, Runergy, SEG Solar, Silfab Solar, Solar Space, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar Relatively new cell technologies may experience long-term degradation associated with light exposure and elevated temperatures. This phenomenon, called light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), is tested with a protocol of light soaking, followed by 75 C (167 F) temperature exposure for two 162-hour cycles to identify significant degradation (>5%). Subsequently, test samples are subject to 500 hours of 75 C temperature exposure followed by two additional 162-hour cycles. Highlighted top performers demonstrated products that had less than 0.75% power loss after 486 hours of exposure. LID resistance Top performers: Dehui Solar, Longi Solar, Merlin Solar Light-induced degradation (LID), or power losses from sunlight exposure, affects some PV cell types but not others. PV modules exposed to LID losses rapidly lose performance over the first few hours or days of operation before stabilizing. RETC notes LID resistance is highly correlated with cell type. Top performers were all monocrystalline silicon panels and experienced an increase in performance or a modest decrease amounting to less than one tenth of one percent. Module efficiency Top performers: Auxin Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Meyer Burger, Mission Solar, Qcells, REC Solar, Silfab Solar, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar Module efficiency, or the percentage of incident solar energy converted to electrical energy, is a well-known and key metric for solar performance. It is highly correlated with cell technology and module design. The top 14 highest scoring modules scored efficiencies of 20% or more. An n-type TOPCon cell scored the highest at 25.8% efficiency, followed by a monocrystalline silicon module with heterojunction technology, recording a 22.4% efficiency. PAN file Popular content Top performers: Dehui Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Yingli Solar The PAN file test is a module characterization test with 22 parameters set by the PVsyst modeling software. Project developers use PVsyst to evaluate potential sites based on energy production and financial performance. The assuming filed test conditions of a 10 MW utility-scale solar plant in Midland, Texas with fixed tilt ground mounts and 500 kVA central inverters. Top performers in the PAN test achieved a performance ratio in PVsyst of 85% or greater. pv magazine print edition In the latest, \u201cIn Conversation\u201d issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout. Reliability Damp heat test Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar The RETC thresher test includes a damp heat test that exposes modules for 2,000 hours, double the amount required for product certification. The test evaluates a module\u2019s ability to withstand prolonged exposure to humid, high-temperature environments. Taking place inside an environmental chamber, the test exposes modules to a controlled temperature of 85 C (185 F) and a relative humidity of 85% for a set amount of time. RETC highlighted performers that experienced less than 2% degradation after this exposure. PID resistance Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Qcells, Runergy Potential induced degradation (PID) resistance tests rack-mounted modules in an environmental chamber, which controls temperature and humidity, and exposes them to a voltage bias of several hundred volts with respect to the mounting structure. Typically, exposure times range from 96 hours to as much as 500 hours. PID testing characterizes a module\u2019s ability to withstand degradation due to voltage and current leakage resulting from ion mobility between the semiconductor and other elements in module packaging. Nearly 28% of the test samples experienced less than 1% degradation over the test period. By comparison, less than 9% of modules achieved greater than 5% power loss. Static and dynamic mechanical load test Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar This test exposes modules to 1,000 cycles of +1,000 pascal and \u20131,000 pascal loads at a frequency of three to seven cycles per minute. Measurements were taken after this stress test rate electrical performance. This year, nearly 47% of the modules that RETC subjected to simulated wind and environmental stresses achieved less than 2% degradation in power. Roughly 17% of the total test samples experienced less than 1% degradation in power after the SDML sequence. RETC notes that the results in this category represent a modest improvement on a year-over-year basis. Thermal cycling Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Saint Gobain, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar The thermal cycle test calls for cycling modules in an environmental chamber between two temperature extremes\u201485 C (185 F) on the high end and \u201340 C (\u201340F) on the low end. The RETC test runs 600 cycles, three times as much as the 200 required for certification. Roughly 80% of modules in this test achieved less than 2% power loss, while only 2.4% had power losses of 4% or more. Overall top performers \u201cTo identify the best of the best, we reviewed and ranked the overall data distributions across all three disciplines: quality, performance, and reliability. The Overall Results Matrix on the right summarizes the results of this analysis, which highlights eight high achievers based on overall highest achievement in manufacturing,\u201d said RETC. Top performers (alphabetical order): Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar","filter_flag":1}

Here's what you need to know about sustainability. MURAT TANER\/GETTY IMAGES What Does Sustainable Mean? As we hear more about climate and other environmental concerns, it\u2019s helpful to know what we can do at home to make a difference. We\u2019re often asked to be more sustainable and to buy sustainable products, but what does sustainability actually mean? The term was first used in 1864, when American conservationist George Perkins Marsh discussed the importance of a harmonious relationship between humans and the natural world in his book, Man and Nature. He warned of the dangers that could arise if we exhausted our natural resources too quickly. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainability as \u201cmeeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d In 1969, the National Environmental Policy Act committed the United States to sustainability, declaring it a national policy \u201cto create and maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.\u201d These three pillars of sustainability \u2014 aka the triple bottom line \u2014 are often referred to as people, profit and the planet. Knowing some key facts about sustainability will help you be a better consumer while reducing your negative impact on the planet. While you\u2019re at it, also learn about some sustainability techniques that modern day sustainable builders incorporate in their work for a better environment.","filter_flag":1}

Singh grew up on a farm in India, and is committed to bettering agriculture\u2019s future. John Deere, headquartered in Moline, Ill., is a leader in agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf-care machinery. Singh, a power-electronics engineer, has been working to replace the internal combustion engines used in the company\u2019s equipment with hybrid (diesel-electric) and all-electric versions. \u201cPower electronics and electrification of agricultural equipment can help change our world for the better by reducing the equipment\u2019s greenhouse gas footprint, providing food and fiber to feed, house, and clothe the world, and helping farmers stay profitable,\u201d Singh says. Singh grew up on a 10-hectare farm his family has owned for more than six centuries in Shahpur Charki, a 560-person village in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Brij Singh Employer: John Deere, Fargo, N.D. Title: External relationships manager for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States Education: Bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, Mohan Malaviya Engineering College; master\u2019s degree in engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee; Ph.D. in engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi \u201cI come from a long line of farmers. I personally know how important [farming] is,\u201d he says. In 2007, he joined John Deere\u2019s electronics-solutions group, in Fargo, N.D., as a staff engineer. Three years ago, he moved from his technical role to a more tactical role, taking on the newly created position of external relationships manager. He is responsible for securing government funding to carry out the company\u2019s R&D work in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. He also helps establish collaborations with academic research groups to work on emerging technologies that could be used to create new products. Singh enjoys the broader scope and added responsibility of his current job. \u201cI\u2019m now involved with deciding the kinds of vehicles to work on, technologies and components to design and test, and timelines,\u201d the IEEE Fellow says. Transitioning to hybrid and all-electric machinery Earlier in his career, Singh helped Deere begin the transition away from diesel engines. As staff engineer from 2007 through 2011, he led, managed, and contributed to the design, development, and deployment of electrification technologies. Inverter technology that he developed has been used in John Deere\u2019s 644K and 944K wheel loaders since 2012. Inverters allow a machine\u2019s power train to run power between the electrical machines, acting like a generator or motor, and they convert electricity from AC to DC and back again. Wheel loaders have front and back booms and buckets that move soil, sand, rocks, and other materials. The 944K weighs more than 56 tonnes, and has a bucket capacity of up to 7.65 cubic meters. Watch this video of a 944K in action. John Deere 944K Hybrid Wheel Loader 360\u00b0 Experience www.youtube.com During Singh\u2019s time as a postdoctoral fellow at the \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, at the University of Quebec, in Montreal, his research involved an indirect-current control technique to reduce harmonics created when different AC waveforms (voltages and frequencies) would create component-damaging heat; the system he developed kept the voltage free of harmonic distortion. Singh\u2019s work is generally being used in non-Deere applications, such as a battery-charging system connected to distributed energy resources like solar, wind, and diesel generators. The benefits of electric industrial vehicles Moving from diesel to hybrid and all-electric industrial vehicles offers many benefits, Singh says. For the operator, the machines are significantly less noisy and easier to control. For the owner, the vehicles reduce costs because they have greater fuel efficiency and less tire wear, and they require fewer repairs. They also emit less greenhouse gasses, which is both a company goal and increasingly mandated by governments. Like the automotive industry\u2019s move to hybrid and all-electric vehicles, the industrial-machine transition requires new designs, software, and materials to be developed and tested. That was Singh\u2019s job when he joined the company\u2019s advanced power-electronics department in 2011 as a senior staff engineer. He worked on high-efficiency electronics systems, including wide-bandgap power-conversion technologies for EV inverters. Semiconductor devices made with wide-bandgap materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) can operate at much higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional silicon devices can. These materials allow components like inverters to be smaller and more energy efficient, Singh says. \u201cPower electrics and electrification of agricultural equipment can help change our world for the better by reducing the equipment\u2019s greenhouse gas footprint, and providing food and fiber to feed, house, and clothe the world.\u201d To accelerate Deere\u2019s electrification evolution, from 2015 through 2021, Singh and his group collaborated with researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a 200-kilowatt, 1,050-volt silicon carbide inverter, which is now used in the 644K and the 944K. The collaboration with NREL led the company to receive funding through a U.S. government program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Singh says his current job of securing government funding and establishing relationships with university groups is necessary in research areas where the company lacks the expertise, time, and resources. \u201cGovernment funding helps the company pursue research and innovation significantly sooner,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout it, we might have to postpone our efforts another 5 to 10 years. With it, innovation is accelerated in developing and adopting new technologies.\u201d Singh is still involved in developing new technologies as he continues to explore emerging tech and its application to farming and construction equipment as a John Deere Fellow. Becoming a power electronics expert Singh was the first in his family to go to college. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989 from Mohan Malaviya Engineering College in Gorakhpur, India. (This institution became the Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology in 2013). He went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in engineering in 1991 from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, in Uttarakhand, and a Ph.D. in engineering in 1996 from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. This was followed by postdoc positions working on various aspects of power electronics, including power-quality control, and AC-to-DC and DC-to-DC converters for use in telecommunications products. Singh spent about two years as a postdoc at ETS Montreal and then a year as a research fellow at Concordia University, also in Montreal. In 2000, he became an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Tulane University, in New Orleans. There he was involved in R&D projects on power quality control converters and renewable energy systems. He taught courses in power electronics, microelectromechanical systems, and RF engineering. Advice for future power engineers There are many career opportunities for engineers who want to work on power electronics, Singh says. That includes working on solar and wind power, electric vehicles, industrial power, and consumer electronics. If you\u2019re interested in learning about how to convert gasoline-powered vehicles to electric ones, Singh suggests taking at least one course in power systems to understand how EV power systems work. Also consider taking a power-electronics course and learning about power topologies, which are the various ways that power components may be interconnected, he says. To design semiconductor devices that use new materials like SiC and GaN, learn some materials science. Does Singh get to test-drive the vehicles he\u2019s helping electrify?

(NYSE: WOLF) today announced that Wolfspeed has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its radio frequency business (Wolfspeed RF) to MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: MTSI) for approximately $75 million in cash, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment, and 711,528 shares of MACOM common stock, valued at $50 million based on the 30 trading day average for MACOM\u2019s common stock through August 21, 2023. The company expects to close the transaction by the end of this year. \u201cGiven the significant growth we\u2019ve seen in automotive, industrial and renewable energy markets, we believe this is the right time to further focus on scaling our Power device and materials businesses to meet this accelerated demand,\u201d said Wolfspeed President and CEO Gregg Lowe. \u201cThis transaction also represents a tremendous opportunity for our RF team to grow and operate at scale, leveraging MACOM\u2019s diverse customer base, RF engineering leadership and operational efficiencies.\u201d Wolfspeed RF\u2019s technology and innovation engine drives a strong product development pipeline, with deep domain expertise supporting a competitive gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon carbide product portfolio optimized for next generation telecommunications infrastructure, military and other commercial applications.

For example, IKEA is moving towards Mitigating Supply Chain Risks \u2013 Circular approaches like reuse and recycling make supply chains more resilient by decreasing dependence on virgin natural resources. This insulates companies from price shocks or supply disruptions. Recycling and Upcycling Create Value From Waste \u2013 Recapturing materials at end-of-life through recycling, or upcycling waste into higher value products, decreases waste disposal costs. It also provides a cost-advantaged source of secondary inputs. Reuse, Repair and Refurbishment Cut Costs \u2013 Reusing components, repairing products and refurbishing goods for resale allows companies to extract more value from materials and assets. This reduces the need for new raw material inputs, lowering materials costs. Refurbishment also enables selling into new secondary markets. Outdoor gear company Patagonia has operated a robust repair program for decades. Transitioning to a circular economy model can significantly reduce risks and costs for businesses in several key ways: For companies willing to rethink products, processes and partnerships, and be mindful of their growing trend towards conscious consumerism , the circular economy unlocks new opportunities for efficiency, sustainability and competitive advantage. While the transition can be challenging, the long-term benefits are substantial. There are many ways architects and related businesses can transition to a more circular mode l, including: working with more durable designs , reusing and refurbishing existing materials as well as a commitment to recycling goods, materials and products. Businesses will be aware of renewable energy options, resource recovery and innovative service offerings. The goal is to maximise product and material utilisation, extend lifespans and extract value at every point. A circular economic model represents a shift away from the traditional linear \u2018take, make, waste\u2019 model, which relies on large quantities of cheap, easily accessible materials and energy. Instead, a circular system aims to decouple economic growth from finite resource consumption. Recognising that consumers\u2019 buying habits are changing Transitioning to a circular economy model can be a powerful way for businesses to enhance their reputation and build stronger customer relationships. With public concern rising over environmental and social issues, adopting sustainable practices helps meet consumer demand for ethical brands. By proactively communicating sustainability initiatives, businesses can boost brand trust and loyalty among today's eco-conscious consumers. As Matt Barker, Founder and CEO of MPB, observed, \u201cGiven increasing environmental concerns around overconsumption, alongside the rising pressure on household income, it's unsurprising that many of us are looking for alternatives to simply buying new, and it's brilliant to see that the perceived stigma around gifting and purchasing used items is declining.\u201d Beyond customers, bringing circular principles to your supply chain also demonstrates a commitment to larger global goals around resource use and labour practices. Collaborating with vendors and suppliers on issues like circular agriculture and ethical working conditions shows shared values across your business ecosystem. Circular services like product-as-a-service leasing, rentals and take-back programs also foster closer customer relationships. These offerings provide regular touchpoints between company and consumer, creating a sense of community and encouraging reuse and retention. This loyalty can be invaluable in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Innovating products and lifespan-expanding services The circular economy opens up exciting opportunities for companies to innovate their offerings in impactful ways. By designing products and services to maximise lifespan and utilisation, businesses can find new value in underused assets. For example, creative design and business model choices allow products to be reused, remanufactured, shared or continuously upgraded instead of discarded. Exploring novel offerings like product-service systems, rentals, resale and take-back programmes can generate competitive differentiation and new revenue streams. These innovations also unlock savings and sustainability benefits. Durability, modularity and recyclability allow assets to circulate in loops rather than be tossed in landfills. Waste from one process can become feedstock for creating new products and materials. Transitioning to circular systems inspires new ways of thinking about resources, capabilities and customer needs. It pushes companies to stretch their creativity and find unexpected solutions. In the process, they strengthen resilience, reduce costs and provide society with much-needed alternatives to our wasteful linear economy. The circular economy empowers businesses to become innovators and disruptors. By bravely moving beyond business-as-usual, companies can develop truly differentiated and impactful products, services and processes. This sparks a virtuous cycle \u2013 circularity enabling innovation enabling competitiveness and leadership. Realising revenue and profit through circularity The circular economy opens up innovative ways for companies to boost revenues and profitability through creative use of underutilised assets and capabilities. Rather than automatically discarding waste and by-products, circular thinking sees these streams as potential inputs for creating valuable new products, materials, or services. With the right design and marketing, trash can be turned into cash by unlocking hidden value. Expanding offerings like repairs, maintenance, upgrades and remanufacturing also provide new income streams while prolonging existing product lifespans. These services may require additional tools, replacement parts or consumables that can drive incremental sales. Remanufactured and refurbished goods present an opportunity to target new demographics and geographies at more accessible price points. By selling quality products to markets that couldn't otherwise afford them, businesses can dramatically expand their addressable market. Winning circular models: a draw for skilled employees Transitioning to a circular economy model can be a powerful talent magnet for businesses. With increasing focus on ethics and sustainability among younger demographics, circularity helps attract and retain sought-after employees. Studies show that purpose is a top factor in the modern workforce. For example, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, suggests 88% of millennials will only want to work for companies with values they share. Companies with an authentic brand purpose tied to environmentalism often become talent destinations. Adopting circular practices signals commitment to larger societal goals that resonate across generations. On the retention side, integrating sustainability across operations shows employees that their values are shared by the company. This drives engagement and satisfaction. There are also opportunities to incorporate circular economy education into corporate training and leadership development programs. This builds critical knowledge while empowering employees to participate in green initiatives. Is it time to adopt circularity in your business? The circular economy offers numerous benefits that strengthen and future-proof businesses, from cost savings to innovation to talent acquisition. By taking a holistic, systems-thinking approach, companies can redesign processes, products, and partnerships to eliminate waste and protect resources. While the transition requires effort, a circular model allows organisations to meet sustainability goals while gaining durability, agility and competitive advantage.

The funding will be used to scale its platform and grow the company\u0092s engineering, machine learning, and hardware teams. \u0093Nature invented nanoscale machinery called proteins that can move and rearrange atoms. At Aether, we\u0092re engineering these proteins to go beyond what nature intended to assemble new classes of molecules, transforming proteins into generalized molecular assemblers. Applications range from critical mineral extraction to the assembly of novel classes of materials with unprecedented properties,\u0094 said Pavle Jeremic, CEO and founder of Aether. \u0093In the long term, these assemblers will enable the construction of effectively any product at extremely low costs.\u0094 How does Aether\u0092s Molecular Assembler Platform work? The platform combines high-throughput robotics, machine learning, and synthetic biology to map millions of enzyme-reaction combinations. By generating unprecedented amounts of experimental data, the platform is able to engineer entirely new classes of nanoscale machines using protein building blocks called molecular assemblers. These molecular assemblers contain the power and sophistication of gigantic chemical factories, but on the scale of nanometers. \u0093Aether\u0092s revolutionary platform builds upon nature\u0092s machinery to deliver solutions that are cheaper, faster, and greener than any current technology or process on the market,\u0094 said Trevor Zimmerman, co-founder and managing partner at Unless. \u0093Current enzyme technologies are limited to catalyzing natural-like reactions while Aether\u0092s enzyme application space is far greater \u0096 unlocking enzymatic pathways to high-value chemicals that don\u0092t have a natural pathway. For example, lithium complexation.\u0094 How does the platform create new materials? These assemblers can synthesize new products with greater strength, flexibility, and chemical resistance. An example use case is in the defense industry, where Aether\u0092s novel materials can dramatically increase the effectiveness and elasticity of ballistic materials, such as Kevlar-like products. Another example is combining the materials with industrial plastics like PEEK to improve processability, strength, and flexibility. How does the platform extract metals? While Aether\u0092s assemblers can be used to create new molecules, they can also be used to extract molecules, such as metals. To do so, Aether\u0092s molecular assemblers are introduced to a brine where they bond only to specified metal atoms, regardless of the concentration. From there, Aether programs these assemblers to release the element into a new solution \u0096 one that is now highly concentrated with atoms of the specified element and void of other contaminants and unwanted materials. The company\u0092s initial emphasis is on lithium, with plans to extract additional metals in the future, such as rare earth metals, titanium, and other critical minerals. Aether\u0092s extraction process also eliminates the need for costly infrastructure that takes years to build, relying instead on portable, modular, shipping containers where the extraction and refinery occurs. With Aether, equipment can be deployed at unprecedented speeds while providing the unique ability to extract metals from previously inaccessible target metal reserves. \u0093Using machine learning with a real-time lab engine built into the training loop, Aether discovers novel enzymes and peptides that can functionally and effectively do many things - including the extraction of metals like lithium from brines and building flexible Kevlar-like material,\u0094 said Jay Zaveri, founder of Natural Capital and partner at Social Capital. \u0093Aether is the future of manufacturing where things that were not thought possible with chemical engineering are now possible through the engineering of new classes of enzymes that do specific work with lower energy needs, cleaner processes, and fast scalable systems.\u0094 Sustaining a Lithium-Powered Future The world possesses enough lithium to meet increasing demand, however, current mining and extraction practices impede access to these reserves. As a result, the International Energy Agency warns of potential global lithium shortages by 2025, driven by the surging demand for lithium in renewable energy systems and electric vehicle batteries. Current extraction techniques, including open-pit mining or evaporation ponds, require lithium concentration to be high enough for extraction to be commercially viable \u0096 while also requiring vast amounts of land and water. By utilizing its molecular assemblers, Aether can extract lithium from previously untapped sources \u0096 increasing domestic production by 30x. Additionally, because this process takes place via a closed-loop system without the use of harsh chemicals, virtually any water used in the process can be safely returned to the source, requiring 50,000x less water than evaporative methods used in South America\u0092s so-called Lithium Triangle. Aether will initially focus its lithium extraction efforts in the southern, middle portions of the United States, including Oklahoma and Arkansas, where subterranean lithium exists in sizable amounts but at lower concentrations. Texas and Oklahoma will also be key areas of focus given the company\u0092s unique ability to extract lithium from oil and gas wastewater byproducts, as well as capped oil wells. About Aether Aether is building nanoscale machinery that can assemble new classes of molecules from organic and metallic atoms. By mapping out millions of enzyme reactions, Aether utilizes new industrial processes, enabling faster development cycles, lower costs, and unprecedented materials advancements. Aether\u0092s approach also addresses the global demand for critical metals such as lithium by utilizing biologically-inspired molecular assemblers that can extract battery-grade lithium at a lower concentration, contributing to a greener, electrified future. Aether is dedicated to unleashing the full potential of Earth\u0092s materials and ushering in a future of abundance. To learn more about Aether, visit: www.aetherbio.com","filter_flag":1}

Fiscal Management and Governance: While the Financial Oversight and Management Board reviews all financial decisions, we must create rigorous financial implementation once Puerto Rico emerges from Bankruptcy. Addressing fiscal challenges and improving governance are essential for creating a conducive environment for economic growth: \u2022 Debt Limitation Legislation: Enact legislation that sets clear limits on the amount of debt the Government can incur, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the GDP. These limits can be based on Puerto Rico's ability to service the debt without compromising essential services. \u2022 Transparency and Accountability: Enhance transparency in government operations, budget allocation, and public procurement to build trust and attract investments. \u2022 Multiyear budgeting with Long Term Planning: Develop comprehensive multiyear budgeting that includes long-term projections of revenues and expenses. This approach promotes better planning, reduces short-term decision-making, and aids in identifying potential budget gaps. \u2022 Structural Reforms: We must transform the Government by doing away with unneeded agencies, services, and bureaucracy, creating a more spartan nimbler government. It will also significantly reduce the revenue-to-expense ratio. \u2022 Efficiency Measures: Implement cost-saving measures across government agencies to allocate resources effectively and direct funds toward strategic initiatives. 5. Infrastructure Investment: Improving infrastructure is a critical enabler of economic competitiveness: \u2022 Transportation Modernization: Upgrade transportation networks, including roads, ports, and airports and convert the \u201cTren Urbano\u201d into a real solution for mass transit to enhance connectivity and facilitate the movement of goods and people. \u2022 Renewable Energy Development: Invest in renewable energy infrastructure to reduce energy costs, enhance sustainability, and attract energy-intensive industries. \u2022 Digital Connectivity: Expand access to high-speed internet across the island to support digital industries and remote work opportunities. In summary, Puerto Rico has the potential to enhance its economic growth and competitiveness by drawing lessons from New Zealand's success and implementing a comprehensive plan of action. By diversifying the economy, investing in education and workforce development, engaging in trade agreements, addressing fiscal challenges, and improving infrastructure, Puerto Rico can transform its economic landscape and create a more resilient and prosperous future for its citizens. Maurice Mctigue and The New Zealand Miracle Maurice McTigue played a pivotal role in the economic reforms that contributed to what is often referred to as the \"New Zealand Miracle\". He was vital in implementing policies transforming New Zealand's economy and government operations during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his notable contributions include economic deregulation, state-owned enterprise reforms and privatization, fiscal responsibility, public sector reforms, local government empowerment, government streamlining and export-oriented growth. Maurice McTigue's contributions were rooted in the belief that empowering individuals, businesses, and local communities while minimizing government intervention could lead to sustainable economic growth. The lessons from McTigue's work highlight the potential for other economies, including Puerto Rico, to achieve similar transformations by adopting policies encouraging market-driven growth, fiscal responsibility, efficient governance and an open business environment. Are our political leaders ready to accomplish such a transformation? The importance in policy development is knowing first if the current policies work or whether different activities would produce better results. The critical requirement is identifying the public benefit sought and then seeking proof that the recent actions beneficially impact that outcome. Absent this proof, every decision taken may be described as \"Anchored in philosophical beliefs.\" \"The canvas of Puerto Rico's future is painted stroke by stroke with the brush of today's pivotal choices; each decision serves as a color that could define whether our work is a masterpiece or a failure; the future is in our hands.\"","filter_flag":1}

The Canadian forest sector took early actions in this direction, successfully reducing its GHG emissions by nearly 70 percent since the early 1990s. Achieving this milestone has involved enhancing energy efficiency and transitioning from fossil fuels to bioenergy by utilizing wood processing residues. Additional efforts are now needed to effectively meet Canada\u2019s GHG reduction targets. While it is technically feasible to fully realize the potential of the forest sector to reach net-zero, or even net-negative emissions, substantial investments in technical and capital resources are indispensable to implement cutting-edge energy-efficient technologies, electrification, bioenergy and carbon capture. Context With energy consumption of approximately 600 PJ\/year, the manufacturing facilities of the forest sector use more energy than any other major Canadian manufacturing sector, including the iron and steel, cement, oil refineries and petrochemical sectors. However, this sector is unique in that a large part of its energy needs is met by renewable energy. Biomass-based fuels have enabled the industry to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, helping to lower its net GHG emissions considerably. Energy assessment and mapping Evaluation of fuel consumption across major steps of the forest sector, from forest harvesting to transportation of finished products (Figure 1), has been performed to define the energy profile of the Canadian forest value chain. Data on energy usage and GHG emissions are available through public databases such as the National Energy Use Database launched by Natural Resources Canada in 1991, Canada\u2019s National Inventory Report, and GHG Reporting Program led by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Since these databases focus on energy and GHG data for the pulp and paper sector, information for upstream and downstream operations is less defined. Specific attention was given to estimating diesel consumption. Advertisement The results illustrate that energy sources \u2013 fossil fuels, bioenergy, electricity \u2013 are not equally distributed along the forest value chain. Most of the energy is consumed in wood product manufacturing and pulp and paper mills (20 percent of the energy from fossil fuels, 25 percent as electricity and 55 percent from bioenergy). Mills also produce 8950 GWh per year of renewable electricity, of which over 60 percent is coming from cogeneration. Diesel fuel is used for harvesting operations and transportation of logs and wood chips to pulp mills, and shipping final products carried out by truck or rail transport. Natural gas is the most common fossil fuel in manufacturing facilities, mostly supplied to boilers, lime kilns and internal combustion dryers. Diesel consumption, on the other hand, in sawmills, wood product manufacturing, forest harvesting, wood and product transportation is estimated to be approximately 80 PJ\/y or 2.1 BL\/y of diesel. Diesel in these processes is used in heavy machinery and is heavily impacted by carbon policies such as Clean Fuel Regulations and the carbon fuel charge. Emissions landscape GHGs emitted from fossil fuels are generally considered to be the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change and are the focus of most carbon reduction policies. Emissions from biogenic sources, however, are considered carbon neutral within the accounting standard put forward by the International Panel on Climate Change. When biomass comes from residual materials generated by sustainable forestry, the biogenic emissions released from its combustion are offset by CO 2 captured by forests, with a carbon debt. In that framework, long-term storage of biogenic CO 2 is considered a negative emission. The distribution of energy sources translates to a similar distribution of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions generated along the forest value chain. In 2020, 10.1 million tonnes (Mt) of fossil fuel-based GHG emissions were produced (excluding final product transportation), with around 54 percent (5.5 Mt CO 2 e) originating from stationary sources within pulp and paper facilities. The production of fossil emissions from stationary equipment is as follows: the power boilers account for about 71percent of fossil fuel emissions (including co-firing in hog fuel boilers), the lime kilns contribute approximately 20 percent and tissue\/BCTMP dryers at nine percent. While fossil-based emissions through the forest value chain (Figure 2) are notable, they pale in comparison to the biogenic emissions, which amounted to 29.3 Mt CO 2 e, bringing the sector\u2019s total emissions to approximately 39.4 Mt CO 2 e when final product transportation is excluded. The forest sector\u2019s emissions are mostly biogenic and largely concentrated in pulp and paper mills. The biogenic CO 2 is emitted from residual pulping liquor burned in recovery boilers in the kraft pulping process (57 percent), from wood-based residues in power boilers (40 percent) and from process emissions in lime kilns (three percent). The wood processing facilities also use a large amount of bioenergy, mostly in boilers, furnaces and dryers. Capturing part of these emissions, especially in kraft mills, and permanently removing them from the atmosphere, would enable the forest sector to become carbon-negative. This could help Canada achieve net-zero industrial emissions by compensating for hard-to-abate industrial sectors. Additionally, it presents a valuable revenue stream for the pulp and paper industry. Carbon capture from pulp mills has been shown to be feasible but is not currently economically viable at a small scale if no credit is provided for negative emissions or without a market to sell captured CO 2 . While biogenic emissions are usually reported, they are not priced or subject to regulation under current national carbon policies. Why must we act now? In its 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, Canada has committed to exploring the potential for negative-emission technologies in the forest sector, particularly in facilities where biomass is used as an energy source. Carbon taxes can be mitigated by lowering GHG emissions at forest products facilities. Cost-effective energy efficiency measures are still available if manufacturing facilities to further reduce fossil-fuel utilization, notably using heat recovery systems and advanced controls. Increasing carbon prices will likely help improve the collection and utilization of harvesting residues. Industry transformation is ongoing as traditional products such as paper and newsprint give way to different new products. Key takeaway Canada\u2019s forestry sector is a large and energy-intensive industry, occupying a unique position as a predominant consumer of bioenergy. This sector offers promising avenues for reducing fossil fuel consumption and attaining carbon negativity. By integrating additional decarbonization strategies such as enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to electrification and bioenergy, and implementing carbon capture technologies, the forestry sector can not only thrive but also shape a sustainable, low-carbon future for Canada. \u00a9 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Natural Resources, 2023 Luciana Savulescu (corresponding author), Jawad Jeaidi, Adam Rogerson are from Natural Resources Canada, CanmetENERGY, Industrial System Optimization Group.

Moreover, with the notice of the European Union\u2019s forthcoming implementation of a carbon border tax, carbon neutrality in industries with high carbon intensity can no longer be deferred. In particular, steel is a typical carbon-intensive product that involves an iron ore reaction with coal as fuel and coke as a reducing agent and produces significant carbon emissions during manufacturing. POSCO, a leading steel company, declared 2050 Carbon Neutrality on December 11, 2020, and plans a comprehensive infrastructure reorganization to achieve decarbonization with eco-friendly raw materials, carbon capture and recycling, and hydrogen reduction steelmaking. Launch of Greenate, an integrated initiative brand POSCO is taking steps as Korea\u2019s leader in carbon neutrality by actively participating in technology, product innovation and social efforts to reduce carbon emissions. In November 2022, POSCO launched the carbon-neutral master brand Greenate at the Green Materials Forum 2022 held to strengthen future business with customers. The brand name is a compound word of \u201cGreen,\u201d which represents POSCO\u2019s commitment to the environment, and \u201c-ate,\u201d a suffix that means acting in a certain way, and expresses POSCO\u2019s intention to create a \u201cgreen planet.\u201d POSCO launched Greenate because of the need to integrate its efforts and outcomes to achieve carbon neutrality and communicate them intuitively. POSCO\u2019s flagship eco-friendly brand Greenate consists of three categories: Steel, Tech & Process, and Infrastructure, and covers not only POSCO\u2019s eco-friendly steel products led by e Autopos, INNOVILT, and Greenable, but also low-carbon steel technology and processes, especially next-generation hydrogen reduction iron and steel making. Introduction of sub-brands: \u2460 Steel, \u2461 Tech & Process, and \u2462 Infrastructure First, Greenate Steel refers to products that contribute to reducing carbon footprints throughout the life cycle assessment (LCA) from steel production to use and disposal. It is divided into footprint minimization and handprint enhancement products. Footprint minimization and handprint enhancement products 1. Footprint minimization products: They include steel produced using recycled raw materials, such as scrap, to reduce carbon emission during steel production and by applying carbon-reducing manufacturing technology such as using new & renewable energy power and applying low-carbon fuel and raw materials. 2. Handprint enhancement products: They are steel materials that contribute to reducing carbon footprint from a customer\u2019s use cycle perspective, such as the use and disposal of steel and include steel materials that replace competitive materials, such as aluminum and cement, that emit much carbon in product processes compared to steel materials, along with those that are applied to low-carbon industrial use, such as wind power, solar power, and hydrogen, and those such as high-tensile automotive steel plates that contribute to improving automobile fuel efficiency. Greenate Tech & Process includes low-carbon steel technology and processes. POSCO plans to reduce the amount of coal and energy used in processes by introducing electric furnaces, using hot briquette iron (HBI) for facilities currently in operation, and developing bridge technologies such as low-HMR operation\/CCUS technology. In the case of hydrogen reduction iron and steelmaking process technology, POSCO plans to verify the feasibility of commercializing HyRex technology based on FINEX fluidized reduction furnace technology by 2030 to break away from conventional blast furnace steel making that emits carbon by reacting coal with iron ore. Greenate Infrastructure establishes all necessary conditions for the realization of Greenate Steel and Greenate Tech & Process. POSCO plans to establish a hydrogen production and supply system for the hydrogen reduction iron and steelmaking technology and achieve carbon neutrality with an eco-friendly power infrastructure. POSCO, hosted the world\u2019s first Hydrogen Iron & Steel Making Forum (HyIS Forum) in 2021, updates the progress of global hydrogen reduction iron and steel initiatives and discusses measures to reduce GHG at the forum each year. The company also collaborates with various companies on raw materials, steel, and equipment technology through the HyRex R&D Partnership exchange platform. POSCO plans to continue to expand various activities aimed at carbon reduction. Operational status of global competitors\u2019 low-carbon brands Global steel companies also operate master brands that include steel technology projects to achieve carbon neutrality. ArcelorMittal announced the XCarb Initiative, a green innovation project to build a next-generation circular economy and demonstrate carbon-neutral steel. The company introduced the XCarb Green Steel Certificate to help its customers reduce their carbon footprint. Another steel maker, Salzgitter AG, plans to dramatically reduce carbon emissions during steel production based on its conversion program SALCOS (SALzgitter Low CO\u2082 Steelmaking). The company is testing carbon-free steel manufacturing processes to realize green hydrogen production. Nippon Steel announced that it will sell carbon-neutral steel with zero CO2 emissions starting this year. Its decarbonization strategy includes using green electricity, developing high-performance products, such as advanced ultra-high-strength steel (AHSS) to reduce vehicle weight and high-performance steel for EV drive motors, and increasing supply capacity. POSCO Launches Korea\u2019s First Low-Carbon Brand Product One of the notable products introduced by POSCO is \u201cGreenate certified steelTM,\u201d which operates on a mass-balance principle. This product effectively reduces carbon emissions by distributing the emissions saved through the implementation of low-carbon production processes and the use of low-carbon steel. Companies that purchase this product are acknowledged for their efforts in reducing carbon emissions equivalent to the amount associated with the product. At the Green Materials Forum 2022 on November 1 last year, POSCO Group launched Greenate, a master brand representing the company\u2019s ambitious mission to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, after which the product is named. Greenate encompasses all the efforts and products of POSCO Group to produce low-carbon steel and eco-friendly secondary battery materials, as well as the three major eco-friendly steel brands e Autopos, INNOVILT, and Greenable. Leading steel manufacturers in Europe and Japan had already adopted the mass balance methodology, which involves allocating carbon reductions to specific steel products, in 2021. POSCO became the first company in Korea to adopt this method for launching a low-emission product. The evaluation of carbon emission reduction for Greenate was conducted according to the GHG Protocol, a widely used international standard that measures greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment was performed by DNV (Det Norske Veritas) UK, one of the top three certification agencies globally, with extensive experience in certifying carbon-reduced steel from steel companies worldwide. The evaluation took place at POSCO\u2019s Pohang Works and Gwangyang Works. Companies that purchase Greenate certified steelTM receive DNV\u2019s product guarantee, with includes information on carbon reduction information on the raw material, along with POSCO\u2019s purchase certificate. \u201cThe low emission trend is inevitable in the steel industry, and POSCO is responding proactively by launching new products,\u201d Gi-cheon Eom, Head of Marketing Strategy Office, said at the briefing session. \u201cWith the launch of Greenate certified steelTM, the company has taken a step forward in its long journey towards carbon neutrality.\u201d LG Electronics is the first client to purchase the newly released Greenate certified steelTM. Last November, POSCO and LG Electronics signed a business agreement for the supply and purchase of mass-balance type low-carbon steel products. Immediately after the product launch, LG Electronics placed an order for 200 tons of the new steel, which will be used as materials for their dryers. The company intends to actively explore opportunities for expanding the use of low-carbon steel in household appliances in the future. In addition, Samsung Electronics is currently considering the procurement of Greenate certified steelTM for their premium ovens. Recently, POSCO and Samsung Electronics entered into a three-year supply contract for high-strength, high-corrosion, and electric steel plate products for home appliances. This marks the first long-term agreement between the two companies, underscoring their shared dedication to technological collaboration and carbon neutrality. POSCO actively invests in the transformation to climate-friendly production, even in the high-energy era POSCO Group launched the holding company POSCO Holdings in March of last year and announced its aspiration to grow into a leading eco-friendly future materials company by gradually shifting to a carbon-neutral production system and proactively establishing eco-friendly infrastructure to achieve its 2050 carbon neutrality goal. As POSCO Greenate won the grand prize in each category in the Korea Consumer Appraisal Brand (KCAB) hosted by The Dong-A Ilbo in February, the Group is expected to solidify its global competitiveness in the low-carbon era with continuous innovation in eco-friendly steel products, production technology and solutions using products. POSCO plans to reduce carbon emissions by improving conventional blast furnace-based low-carbon operation technology and building new electric furnaces that directly produce molten steel or mix it with molten steel produced by blast furnaces beginning in 2026. Moreover, after completing a test facility for hydrogen reduction steelmaking in 2026, the company plans to complete commercialization technology by 2030 and gradually convert production facilities to a hydrogen reduction steelmaking method. In line with this, POSCO plans to support the carbon reduction activities of customers by selling renewable energy steel with the purchase of renewable energy credits, etc., and Greenate-Certified SteelTM using a carbon allocation method in the short term until the Gwangyang Steel Plant\u2019s electric furnace is fully operational in 2026, and in the mid- to long-term, it plans to sell Greenate carbon-reduced steel, which reduces carbon emissions by 30% or more through blast furnace-based low-carbon operation, cutting-edge large-scale electric furnaces, and hydrogen reduction steelmaking.","filter_flag":1}

The IEX accounted for a major share in the DAM with a trading volume of 51.18 BUs, while PXIL accounted for 0.19 BUs and HPX accounted for the remaining volume. RTM: During 2022-23, an aggregate vol\u00adume of 24.19 BUs was transacted on the power exchange platforms in the RTM segment, an increase of 21.5 per cent over the previous year wherein an aggregate volume of 19.91 BUs was transacted. Term-ahead market (TAM): During 2022-23, an aggregate volume of 19.4 BUs was transacted on the three pow\u00ader exchange platforms in this segme\u00adnt, an increase of 94.2 per cent over the previous year wherein an aggregate volume of 9.99 BUs was transacted. Of the total trading volume, the IEX accounted for approximately 10.1 BUs, while PXIL accounted for 8.2 BUs and the remaining 1.08 BUs were traded by HPX. GTAM: During 2022-23, an aggregate volume of 4.19 BUs was transacted in this segment on the three power ex\u00adchange platforms, a decrease of 23.2 per cent over the previous year when an aggregate volume of 5.45 BUs was transacted. Of the total, around 2.6 BUs was traded on the IEX, while PXIL accounted for 1.5 BUs and HPX ac\u00adcounted for the remaining 0.07 BUs. GDAM: During 2022-23, an aggregate volume of 3.82 BUs was transacted in this segment on the power exchange platforms, as compared to 0.92 BUs transacted at IEX during the five mon\u00adths of operation in 2021-22. During 2022-23, approximately 33.8 BUs of electricity was transacted through tra\u00adders, marking a decline of 14.4 per cent from the 39.47 BUs recorded during 2021-22. Energy markets in the country are evolving to facilitate greater adoption of renewable energy. Open access consumer participation During 2021-22, over 5,628 open access (OA) consumers procured power throu\u00adgh two exchange platforms, compared to approximately 5,400 consumers in 2020-21. In both the power exchanges, OA ind\u00adustrial consumers bought 9.74 BU of el\u00adectricity, which formed 11 per cent of the total DAM, GDAM and RTM volume tra\u00adnsacted in the power exchan\u00adges during 2021-22. The weighted average price (WAP) of electricity bought by OA consumers at IEX was Rs 3.20 per kWh, which was lower as compared to the WAP of the to\u00adtal electricity transacted through IEX (Rs 4.73 per kWh), i.e., through DAM, GDAM and RTM. How\u00adever, the WAP of el\u00adectricity bought by OA consumer (Rs 4.99 per kWh), was higher compared to WAP of the total electricity transacted through PXIL (Rs 3.68 per kWh) in 2021-22. Market coupling will lead to the determination of a uniform market clearing price across the country. Renewable energy certificates During 2022-23, 8.16 million renewable energy certificates (RECs) were traded on the three power exchange platforms. Of the total, around 5.97 million RECs were traded on the IEX, while 2.1 million RECs were traded on PXIL and the re\u00admaining 0.09 million RECs on HPX. During the five months of 2021-22 when RECs were transacted, a total of 8.46 million RECs, comprising 1.36 million solar RECs and 7.1 million non-solar RECs, were traded on two exchange platforms. Key developments Market coupling: In June 2023, the Ministry of Power (MoP) directed the Ce\u00adntral Electricity Regulatory Commis\u00adsion (CERC) to initiate the consultation proce\u00adss for market coupling and finalise the framework for its implementation. Ma\u00adrket coupling, which involves the aggregation of buy and sell bids from all power exchange platforms in the country under a single power trading entity, will lead to the determination of a uniform market clearing price across the country. Recently in August 2023, the CERC has issued a staff paper on market coupling. The paper discusses the regulatory provisions for market coupling, international experiences, objectives of market coupling in India, the issues and challenges in implementing market coupling, and the key points for discussion. The development of new products, more trade activity, and positive policy and regulatory changes are expected to contribute to the power market\u2019s expansion. Redesign of the Indian electricity market: A group constituted by the MoP for \u201cDevelopment of Electricity Market in India\u201d has proposed comprehensive solutions to address the key issues in the country\u2019s electricity market design, such as the prevalence of inflexible long-term contracts, the lack of resource adequacy planning and the high reliance on self-scheduling by states. The report highlighted several near-term (less than one year) high-priority items to initiate po\u00adwer market reforms. These items inclu\u00adde implementing security-constrained economic despatch and unit commitments for thermal fleets, operationalising ancillary services regulations, mainstreaming renewable energy participation for select capacity, introducing re\u00adso\u00adurce adequacy and integrated resour\u00adce planning for states\/utilities, and im\u00adplementing time-of-day tariff. HP-DAM: In February 2023, the IEX received the final approval from the CERC to introduce trading in high-price DAM (HP-DAM) contracts. Eligible sellers in the HP-DAM category would inclu\u00adde gas-based power plants that utilise im\u00adported re\u00adgasified liquefied natural gas and naphtha, imported coal-based pow\u00ader plants th\u00adat utilise imported coal, and battery en\u00adergy storage systems. The category of plants eligible to participate in HP-DAM will be subject to a quarterly review by the CERC. The power regulator has fixed a ceiling of Rs 20 per unit for electricity traded in HP-DAM, while a price cap of Rs 10 per unit is applicable across all the other spot power market segments. Ancillary service market: The CERC gave its approval for the power exchange platforms to launch the tertiary reserve ancillary service (TRAS) market segment in April 2023. The TRAS is a frequency control ancillary service capacity meant to keep grid frequency within a specified range. To ensure the availability of secondary reserves and accommodate variations in renewable energy supply, the TRAS framework covers qualified power plants, energy storage systems and in\u00adter\u00adruptible loads ready for despatch. The implementation of TRAS commenced from June 1, 2023. Outlook Going forward, the implementation of several new regulations for general network access, transmission sharing, REC, and the deviation settlement mechanism in the coming months will significantly transform the electricity market. Further, the market will witness the launch of new products including ancillary markets, derivatives, capacity markets and contract for differences. These developments are projected to transform the allocation and utilisation of interstate transmission systems in the country, and will also offer discoms the opportunity to reduce their overall power purchase cost, including transmission charges, by exploring various alternatives in the market. Overall, the development of new products, more trade activity, and positive policy and regulatory changes are expected to contribute to the power market\u2019s expansion during the coming years.","filter_flag":1}

The move comes as German discounter rivals Aldi and Lidl have witnessed sharp sales growth in recent months as cash-strapped shoppers seek to trim their shopping bills. Tesco revealed that more than 50 everyday products in its smaller Express shops will be replaced by better-priced alternatives, many from its own-brand range. A study from Which? earlier this year claimed that shoppers who regularly buy groceries from Tesco and Sainsbury's convenience stores instead of bigger supermarkets were likely to pay hundreds of pounds more over the course of a year due to the higher price of many items stocked. On Friday, Tesco said that the own-brand alternatives being switched in to replace other products are, on average, over 40 percent cheaper. Tesco said that the own-brand alternatives on average will be over 40 percent cheaper It said the move is in response to internal shopping data, which shows that price-conscious customers are increasingly turning to own-brand products for better value. Among the own-brand lines being introduced are Tesco penne pasta (85p) and Tesco smooth peanut butter (\u00a31.65), both of which will cost half the price of the previous branded product stocked, it said. Meanwhile, some branded lines, such as toothpaste, are being replaced by a cheaper branded alternative. The new products will be delivered to stores over the coming fortnight, with the changeover complete by the end of August, Tesco said. The new products will be delivered to stores over the coming fortnight Sarah Lawler, Tesco Convenience managing director, said: \"We know customers are watching every penny at the moment, so we hope these helpful product swaps will bring down food bills for even more families. \"Our Express stores offer unbeatable value on everything from essentials to fresh produce, making healthy food more accessible for the 2,000 communities that we serve across the UK. \"And while our convenience stores don't have the shelf space to carry the full range of our larger shops, by swapping these products, we've been able to make way for even more of our great-value own brand ranges.\" Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
