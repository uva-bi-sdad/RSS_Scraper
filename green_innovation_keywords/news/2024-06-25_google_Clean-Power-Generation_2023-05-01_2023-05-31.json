This not only reduces electricity costs, but also cuts the logistics center's greenhouse gas emissions. Previously, the international supply chain and e-commerce service provider had converted five other distribution centers in the USA to green electricity. The project started as early as November 2019 with an intensive investigation of the site, as an extensive catalog of measures and criteria had to be worked through for the installation and commissioning of the solar power plant on the roof system. After a rigorous process involving numerous stakeholders, the new solar modules were installed in August 2022. However, before the solar system could be officially commissioned, further approvals and permits were required. Once official approval for operation was granted, the switch could be flipped in February 2023 and production of environmentally friendly solar electricity could begin. The photovoltaic system is operated under a Purchase Power Agreement (PPA). This is a unique financing mechanism available in twenty-six U.S. states, including California. While a third-party developer installs, owns and operates the solar panels, Arvato purchases the electricity generated. This allows companies in the U.S. to purchase clean, low-cost electricity without having to finance upfront costs. \"The PPA and the resulting benefits were quite critical to the success of this project,\" says Christina Greenwell, Microsoft AOC F&L Client Services Manager at Arvato, who managed the project from start to finish. \"It allows us to reduce our electricity costs while supporting Bertelsmann's ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\" The 1,160 solar panels were added to an existing system of 920 panels owned by the logistics center's landlord. In total, the panels now cover 45 percent of the roof space at the Ontario distribution center. The emissions generated by the distribution center is now reduced by 72 percent with the new solar panels and clean power generation. As Bertelsmann plans to switch all its sites worldwide to 100 percent green electricity, the remaining emissions will be offset with renewable energy certificates. \"The new solar power plant is a significant step on our path to carbon neutrality and demonstrates our commitment to finding innovative solutions that reduce our carbon footprint,\" said Mitat Aydindag, President of North America at Arvato. \"All employees at the site are pleased that our Ontario distribution center is now a pioneer and is providing effective support in achieving our ambitious climate goal in 2030.\"","filter_flag":1}

Mattiq is a transformative materials design and development company on a mission to decarbonize the fundamental building blocks that power our world. Spun out from Northwestern University, Mattiq blends materials science and artificial intelligence to accelerate the exploration, discovery, and real-world deployment of new materials and processes to power commercially viable, sustainable production of critical chemicals and fuels. Jeff Erhardt, Mattiq CEO Jeff Erhardt is a technology leader and entrepreneur with 20 years of experience in artificial intelligence (AI) and material science. Most recently he was Executive Vice President, Intelligent Systems at General Electric, where he led industrial AI efforts following the company\u2019s acquisition of Wise.io, where he was CEO. Erhardt holds more than 30 patents, an engineering degree from Cornell University, and an MBA from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Tell us about Mattiq Despite major advances in clean power generation and battery technologies, chemical and fuel production remains difficult to decarbonize, directly accounting for ~6% of global CO 2 emissions. Powering these processes with renewable feedstocks and electricity, rather than fossil fuel feedstocks and fossil fuel heat, will enable dramatic reductions in CO 2 emissions and lead to reduced cost of production. At present, the value chain for electrochemical process development and deployment is fragmented and siloed, with different companies specializing in discrete products (i.e., catalyst, catalyst-coated membrane, electrolyzer). As a result, holistic optimization of a complex system is inherently slow and inefficient.Mattiq is reinventing materials design in the context of real-world systems, streamlining a historically slow, linear, and fragmented approach to chemical process development. Enabled by massively parallel experimentation that mimics and miniaturizes real-world systems and turbocharged by data and artificial intelligence, Mattiq uniquely streamlines technical development and partnership ecosystem formation to accelerate commercially viable solutions to market. The result is the radical transformation of electrochemical process design, development, and deployment, leveraging a closed-loop, end-to-end development pipeline, unifying catalyst development, device integration, and field deployment. Ultimately, we deliver clean, modular, and distributed production of the chemicals and fuels that power the world. How does this approach apply to hydrogen production? The iridium challenge 95% of the world\u2019s hydrogen is currently produced via steam methane reforming (SMR) using natural gas as a feedstock. Hydrogen produced from SMR carries a substantial carbon footprint \u2013 and if the CO2 produced during this process is captured and sequestered, this would be known as \u201cblue hydrogen.\u201d However, this adds significant cost and complexity to hydrogen production, opening the door for alternative hydrogen production methods to scale. The next big wave is to produce hydrogen using only water and electricity \u2013 an increasingly cheap and clean resource to power chemical reactions (\u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cclean\u201d hydrogen).\u200b\u200b Clean hydrogen is produced through various electrolyzer architectures (i.e., liquid alkaline, proton exchange membrane [PEM] anion exchange membrane [AEM] and solid oxide), with PEM being adopted by major manufacturers including Cummins, Plug Power, Siemens, and Nel. Electrochemical transformations are driven by electrocatalyst materials, and PEM water electrolyzers rely on both platinum and iridium electrocatalysts. While platinum is a well-known precious metal, iridium presents far greater cost and supply chain risks. Iridium is extremely rare, and its production is highly concentrated in South Africa, which accounts for approximately 80-85% of the six to eight tons of iridium produced per year (only ~1.5 tons per year are available for electrolyzers \u2013 Johnson Matthey). The balance is produced in Russia and Zimbabwe. With increasing demand, the price of iridium has risen from < $1,000 per ounce in 2017 to approximately $5,000 per ounce today. As PEM electrolyzers used for clean hydrogen production are deployed at scale, prices will continue to escalate. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the development of novel catalyst materials with reduced or eliminated iridium content, such that clean hydrogen production can achieve scale. Furthermore, what makes iridium such a good PEM electrolyzer catalyst is its durability in highly acidic environments \u2013 accordingly, any alternative will need to match the operational lifetime of iridium. At present, there is no accepted \u201caccelerated stress testing\u201d protocol that can speed up the rate at which new materials are tested and compared against state-of-the-art iridium catalysts. Accordingly, new materials must individually be tested for months or years before end-users will trust their reliability. The problem with the status quo and Mattiq\u2019s solution Taken together, considering the number and depth of the experimental variables in a PEM electrolyzer \u2013 the ratios of metals in novel electrocatalyst materials, the surrounding chemical environment, the composition of the membrane, etc. \u2013 this becomes a nearly infinite design space as we seek to deploy an active, durable replacement for iridium. The problem is that traditional R&D techniques test, at most, hundreds of systems design combinations per day, and take place within silos along the development process. The result is a slow and inefficient design and deployment of new products. Mattiq is uniquely suited to solve this key challenge, leveraging combinatorial experimentation at unprecedented throughput. Specifically, Mattiq synthesizes tens of thousands of unique materials per experiment \u2013 well-defined nanoparticle alloys of arbitrary but controlled composition \u2013 then tests them for their electrocatalytic activity and durability. Coupled with a tight feedback loop with prototype-scale device testing, Mattiq accelerates the optimization of electrochemical systems. Furthermore, to streamline the commercialization and deployment of these electrochemical systems, Mattiq facilitates partnership ecosystem formation between key players in the value chain, including catalyst-coated membrane manufacturers, electrolyzer manufacturers, and end-users. Given the massive manufacture and deployment of electrolyzers for green hydrogen, reducing or eliminating iridium content in PEM electrolyzer catalysts is a critical target for the industry. Mattiq is solving this problem with its industrial partners. How does this technology work? 1. Expanded pipeline of new materials Given the quantity of catalyst and system design combinations to investigate, our first task is to dramatically widen the pipeline of materials that can be tested. Mattiq arbitrarily synthesizes combinations of any of the ~35 metals that are relevant to electrocatalysis, in mixtures of 2, 3, 4, or more metals alloyed into a single candidate material. These nanoparticle catalyst materials are created using a proprietary nanoscale \u201cprinting\u201d technique that allows Mattiq to controllably synthesize these materials massively in parallel. Ultimately, Mattiq synthesizes and evaluates tens of millions of novel design combinations per day. 2. Accelerated stress testing Durability under industrial operation is critical for new catalyst materials within electrochemical systems. Parallelized stress testing of materials on each material library enables Mattiq to pinpoint candidates that will perform best in real-world settings. Iridium replacements, for example, must be able to withstand highly acidic conditions for years of real-world operation. Subjecting novel catalyst materials to these real-world operating conditions (pH, voltage, etc.) allows for massively parallel durability testing of candidate materials, and the selection of only the most durable for further scaling and testing. 3. End-to-end development pipeline Mattiq\u2019s scope and capabilities go well beyond initial catalyst discovery \u2013 Mattiq scales promising catalyst materials and integrates them into prototype-scale electrolyzer devices to build a tight feedback loop and enable rapid product development. Furthermore, Mattiq builds a partnership ecosystem with industrial manufacturers, enabling performance data collection across scales and rapid deployment of best-in-class electrochemical solutions. 4. Leveraging the World\u2019s Largest Material Performance Data Repository By 2024, Mattiq will have screened one trillion materials for deployment in real-world systems. The data generated by this work provides critical intelligence for refining and further reducing the time it takes to identify high-performance materials and optimize holistic electrochemical systems in the future. You mentioned Mattiq is commencing collaborations with industrial partners to scale. What does this look like? Building a broad ecosystem of partners is critical to delivering solutions at scale. Not only do we need to integrate the technology development ecosystem, but also analyze downstream needs \u2013 including large-scale manufacturing, project development and deployment, and offtakers. Every player has a key role to play, and Mattiq is developing relationships with companies at every stage of the value chain, building a cohesive clean hydrogen ecosystem. Mattiq has the unique ability to fine-tune and tailor solutions for particular partners. As an example, Mattiq may partner with a catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) manufacturer to co-develop a next-generation water electrolyzer CCM or a CCM that enables a novel electrochemical process (e.g., electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, ethylene oxidation, CO2 or biomass valorization, etc.). Mattiq has deep expertise in rapid electrocatalyst discovery, development, and systems optimization within prototype devices, and will work with partners to make the jump to rigorous industrial testing and piloting (bringing in the CCM manufacturer\u2019s customers, the electrolyzer manufacturers, for additional testing), and commercial deployment at scale. The goal of each partnership is to bring together complementary expertise and capabilities to accelerate best-in-class electrochemical solutions to market at scale, where the end result is fine-tuned to our partner\u2019s capabilities and needs.
