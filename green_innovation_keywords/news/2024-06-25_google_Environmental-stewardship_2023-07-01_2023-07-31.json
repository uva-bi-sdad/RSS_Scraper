Consumers are interested and want to know more about the products in their life. From the food they eat to the clothes they wear, consumers want to know more than ever where products come from, how wholesome the ingredients are and what impact they have on the environment \u2014 both as they are produced and after they are consumed. One doesn\u2019t have to look back too far to see how dramatic this transformation has been. Who knew the tree hugging, Birkenstock wearing, granola eaters of the late-1960s were ahead of their time? The mainstreaming of environmental awareness demands manufacturers, brands and retailers get on board or be lost, awash in the green tide. It wasn\u2019t that long ago the concept of sustainability was something new and it established a need for transparency throughout supply chains. Early pioneers \u2014 like Ray Anderson, the founder and chairman of modular carpet manufacturer Interface Inc. \u2014 put the impact of industry on the environment at the center of his company\u2019s culture. Sustainable production and consumption were essential to Anderson, who passed away in 2011.The Ray C. Anderson Foundation was established in his memory to perpetuate Anderson\u2019s notion of \u201c \u2026 businesses doing well by doing good,\u201dand continue his legacy. The foundation notes, \u201cIt\u2019s these noble qualities of advancing knowledge and innovation around environmental stewardship and sustainability that recognized Ray as a pioneer in industrial ecology.\u201d Along the way, the industry learned that cost saving initiatives that reduced water, power and chemical consumption were not only good for business and the environment, but also curried favor with brands and retailers. At the time, who knew brands were even interested? Today, communicating the environmental impact of products has become an integral part of marketing, branding and personal relations. Industry response to downstream industry demands couldn\u2019t be more clearly demonstrated than in the \u201cPFAS In The News\u201d feature in this issue of Textile World. Executive Editor Rachael Davis explores the multifaceted debate of the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), particularly in textiles. But PFAS chemistry is everywhere and used in countless consumer and industrial applications. Known for conferring performance properties as a repellent finish and more, chemistry based on the powerful chemical bond between fluorine and carbon molecules was a magical discovery that led to the development of thousands of chemical compounds. Now, government regulation, industry and the consumer are driving innovation and change in the world of PFAS chemistry. An informed debate is essential here because not all PFAS are the same. And it can be argued that in some applications PFAS chemistry is necessary to achieve the performance required for some very highly technical products. Real change is happening in products that are less performance oriented or those that can achieve the necessary performance attributes with alternative chemistries. A rush to judgment and government regulation is concerning, but pivoting to less concerning chemistries when possible may not be such a bad outcome. July\/August 2023","filter_flag":1}

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that 50 percent of small businesses fail within the first five years. And, for large companies, consider that only 49 of the original Fortune 500 companies remain on the list. While there\u2019s nothing that can guarantee long-term success, there are things that businesses can do to improve how they hire, innovate, and conduct activities, which can contribute to their success. One of the keys is a formal sustainability plan with a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) program as a major component. What is DE&I, and Why is it Important? Diversity includes (but is not limited to) gender, age, nationality, background, culture, skills, neurodivergence, socio-economic status, and other attributes. And, while sustainability is usually associated with environmental stewardship, that\u2019s just part of the equation. In simple terms, sustainability is defined as the ability to endure. This is where DE&I can help, as it can play a significant role in a company\u2019s longevity. So, how can DE&I contribute to a company\u2019s long-term success? Consider that DE&I can help: Attract the right talent. Two out of three job candidates seek companies that have diverse workforces. (What Job Seekers Really Think, Glassdoor) Increase job satisfaction and improve employee retention. Companies experience a 50 percent drop in turnover risk and a 75 percent reduction in sick days when workers feel like they belong. (The Value of Belonging at Work, Harvard Business Review) Enhance team performance. Three-quarters of organizations with frontline decision-making teams that reflect a diverse and inclusive culture exceed financial targets. (Diversity and inclusion Build High-Performance Teams, Gartner) Generate ideas and innovate. Companies with above-average diversity produce a greater proportion of revenue from innovation (45 percent) than companies with below average diversity (26 percent). (How Diverse Leadership Teams Boost Innovation, Boston Consulting Group) Gain a competitive business advantage. Companies with the most ethnically diverse executive teams are 33 percent more likely to outperform their competitors on profitability. (Delivering Through Diversity, McKinsey & Company) A diverse workforce and an inclusive and fair environment are appealing to today\u2019s business professionals. It\u2019s clear that an inclusive, positive work climate that promotes diversity and equity can attract and retain the right people, drive engagement, and foster both creativity and innovation because it takes into account many different points of view. Ultimately, this can lead to a much more sustainable business. DE&I Starts with a Commitment If your company is serious about trying to improve sustainability via efforts like improving DE&I, it\u2019s best to make a formal commitment and set goals. For example, many companies have signed the United Nations Global Compact and use its agenda and goals as a blueprint for aligning company strategies and operations with their universal principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. The UN Global Compact is the world's largest corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiative, with 13,000 corporate participants and other stakeholders in more than 170 countries. Implementing a sustainability plan in your workplace should be approached like any other company initiative. It\u2019s important to conduct a proper assessment and evaluate where your organization is pertaining to DEI and sustainability in order to define needs, set strategy and goals, and develop a way to measure success. Looking at my organization, Axis Communications, for example\u2014in its 2022 Sustainability Report, Axis reported a significant 33 percent increase in gender diversity among both managers and employees in its global operations. Overall, 29 percent of Axis employees are women, and 71 percent are men. Although there is clearly still work to be done, the gap between males and females at Axis, especially in leadership positions, is narrowing. Using Axis corporate sustainability efforts as a guide, Axis Americas has been working on increasing DE&I in our hiring practices, as well. When we began a deep dive into the issue of diversity about five years ago, we didn\u2019t score as well as our counterparts across the globe in this area, so we committed to making improvements. Not only was there an imbalance between the percentage of women and men, but the problem was being exacerbated by the lack of job applications from women. The same applied to the other identities. Accordingly, we committed to working harder to attract a pool of diverse and qualified candidates for our management positions. We\u2019ve moved the needle from 27 percent women in management positions five years ago to 33 percent today. That\u2019s a very positive growth indicator, and we\u2019re working just as hard to increase the number of other types of diverse representation in management. Why focus on management positions first? Because these new hires bring new thinking and new networks of people with them. This change didn\u2019t happen overnight. It was part of a formalized plan, and it\u2019s exciting to see progress being made. Sustainability is defined as the ability to endure. This is where DE&I can help, as it can play a significant role in a company\u2019s longevity. Working Together to Make a Difference No longer just a \u201cnice to have\u201d initiative, improving diversity has become a \u201chave to have\u201d initiative. A diverse employee makeup better reflects society and includes input from a wider variety of stakeholders, which ultimately helps diversify and improve the products and services that a company creates. To increase sustainability and DE&I efforts in security companies, the industry can and should band together to leverage industry associations, working groups, and committees to bring industry-wide change that benefits all of us. One great example is the Security Industry Association\u2019s (SIA) Women in Security Forum. This group offers programs, professional development opportunities, and networking events with the goal of supporting the involvement of women in the security industry. The forum\u2019s purpose is to engage all security professionals to promote, recruit, and cultivate the leadership of women for a more inclusive and diversified industry. In just five short years, the Women in Security Forum has rapidly grown to over 1,300 members. This summer Axis Americas\u2014which played a role in creating the forum\u2014served as a co-chair of the forum\u2019s inaugural Security LeadHER event in Nashville, Tennessee, which brought together security professionals committed to advancing, connecting, and empowering women in security. The work of the Women in Security Forum has also helped raise more than $100,000 in scholarships, provided mentoring opportunities, and included a partnership with Dress for Success where we\u2019ve collected clothing and funds for women looking for assistance in elevating themselves to better jobs. Report Cards Can Help You Evaluate Your Efforts As companies begin or continue efforts to improve sustainability, they should evaluate their efforts\u2014and there are resources available to help do so. EcoVadis, for example, is the world\u2019s largest and most trusted provider of business sustainability ratings, and it has created a global network of more than 100,000 rated companies. It works as a third-party to provide reliable, globally recognized sustainability ratings and insights that enable companies to reduce risk, drive improvement, and accelerate a positive impact on the planet and society. Axis undertakes an assessment each year carried out by EcoVadis to evaluate our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts. For the last two years, Axis has earned a Silver Sustainability Rating from EcoVadis. These ratings not only serve as a testament to your efforts, but they help the organization identify gaps and develop plans for ongoing improvement. The great news is that there are many examples of companies, in general, and in the security industry, in particular, that are incorporating DE&I initiatives and sustainability into long-term planning. This move not only improves diversity within employee populations, but it also encourages diversity of thought and, ultimately, innovation in the development, design, production, and quality of products and services. As we in the security industry work to continue to improve existing technology and invent new products, let\u2019s continue tapping into an expanded talent pool that can add experience, perspective, and diversity of thought. Together, we can raise the bar for the industry and improve our collective sustainability and success. Elaine Palome is the director of human resources, Americas, for Axis Communications.","filter_flag":1}

Evolving consumer and corporate interests regarding the development of food and its impact on the environment, people, and animals is triggering greater demand for ingredients that were sourced in an ethical manner. Ethical sourcing can be far-reaching. While the term often refers to the leveraging of ingredients that suppliers produce using processes and systems that are non-polluting, economically efficient, and conserve non-renewable natural resources and energy, it also can include animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and worker treatment and wages. \u201cIn today\u2019s competitive marketplace, it\u2019s no longer enough to create a great-tasting product,\u201d says Kate Clancy, group sustainability director for ingredient supplier Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate, a unit of Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc. \u201cIncreasingly, it\u2019s the compelling story that captivates consumers.\u201d The treatment of workers and the environment are key considerations in the ethical sourcing of ingredients. Photo courtesy of Cargill Inc. By sourcing ingredients responsibly, companies also can better meet their environmental corporate governance (ESG) goals, which typically include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, more efficiently managing water, and supporting human rights and farmer livelihoods, Clancy says. Retailers join the movement Whole Foods Market is among the retailers focusing on ethical sourcing by, for instance, only offering cage-free or \u201cbetter\u201d eggs in its dairy cases. The operator\u2019s Animal Welfare Standards for Laying Hens requires that suppliers\u2019 hens have room to roam and scratch about; that no antibiotics are given to hens; that there are no land-animal byproducts in hen feed; that nests and perches are available for hens to roost at night; and that hens receive foraging material. Stores communicate such ethical sourcing to shoppers by tagging all eggs in dairy cases with one of four logos that indicate how the chickens live. Designations include: \u201ccage-free plus,\u201d in which birds must be able to move about freely indoors with amenities that support their natural behaviors; \u201coutdoor access,\u201d which signifies access to an outdoor area that is at least equivalent to the area of the house; \u201cpasture-raised,\u201d in which birds must have access to rangeland or grassland; and \u201coutdoor living,\u201d where birds are raised in an outdoor system that supports life on rangeland or grassland for their entire production cycle. Farmers choose their production system based on climate and their farm\u2019s unique environment, and Whole Foods audits each farm on a 15-month interval to ensure compliance and to see the farm in all seasons over the course of time, the retailer reports. \u201cConsumers want their consumption to have a positive impact,\u201d says Jennifer Block, senior vice president, of dairy community relations for the Rosemont, Ill.-based Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy. \u201cThey want to know where their food comes from; that it\u2019s healthy for their bodies; and that it\u2019s produced in ways that take care of the environment, animals, and workers.\u201d Efficient water management is among operators\u2019 key ESG goals. Photo courtesy of Dairy Management Inc. Some processors are emphasizing the ethical sourcing of ingredients through the U.S. Dairy Stewardship Commitment, a voluntary pledge in which companies document and demonstrate social responsibility progress in such areas as animal care, environmental stewardship, product traceability, and community contributions. To date, 36 dairy companies representing approximately 75% of U.S. milk production have adopted the Stewardship Commitment, reports the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy. \u201cEthical sourcing policies and programs are seen not only as \u2018the right thing to do,\u2019 but also as a way of gaining a competitive advantage,\u201d says Mike Aquino, director of ESG for the Washington, D.C.-based International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA). \u201cLong-run chances of supply chain disruption will be lower in well-managed chains that consider environmental, social, and governance risk factors. The demographic difference Demand for dairy products with ethically sourced ingredients, meanwhile, is set to rise as millennial and Gen Z shoppers increase their share of overall grocery spending and baby boomer activity declines, states Anne-Marie Roerink, president and founder of 210 Analytics LLC, a San Antonio-based market research and marketing strategies firm. \u201cIt is these younger generations that have a much higher tendency to weigh ethnical sourcing into their purchasing decisions, whether it be fair wages throughout the supply chain, taking care of the animal, or being mindful of the impact on the planet,\u201d she notes. \u201cThis means that the importance of ethical sourcing is only going to get bigger over the next decade.\u201d Product claims also will increasingly spotlight the use of grass-fed cows for cheese and milk production, as well as regenerative agriculture, Roerink highlights. Regenerative agriculture is a food production system that is designed to nurture and restore soil health while protecting the climate, water resources, and biodiversity, and enhancing farm productivity, she explains. \u201cThere is a growing group of consumers that understand that they are voting with their dollars on how the world is used,\u201d says Andrew Martino, category manager of sugar and sweeteners at Global Organics, a Cambridge, Mass.-based certified organic ingredient supplier. \u201cDairy processors will benefit by communicating clearly to these consumers that they use ethically sourced ingredients and how they selected them.\u201d More ingredient suppliers are opting for grass-feeding while enabling animals to roam. Photo courtesy of Dairy Management Inc. Such shoppers also are often willing to pay more for products that they perceive as being ethically and sustainably sourced, says Amanda Greenlee, Global Organics sustainability coordinator. \u201cAs more ethically sourced products come in the marketplace across multiple departments, the gap between interest and purchase will start to narrow,\u201d Roerink states. \u201cStores with a high focus on ethical sourcing may also use pasture-raised eggs or grass-fed milk in their cakes and other baked goods and will often call this out in the bakery or on pack. The rise in assortment will subsequently drive an increase in awareness and demand.\u201d Verification is vital Processors, meanwhile, can demonstrate their commitment to ethical sourcing and guarantee product integrity by incorporating ingredients that meet the guidelines of third-party certification organizations, notes James Ede, Cargill sustainability lead for starches, sweeteners, and texturizers. Yet, verifying that suppliers are meeting ethical standards is perhaps the biggest challenge for processors that are seeking to incorporate ethically sourced ingredients, relays David Thorrold, general manager, sales and marketing, for Hamilton, New Zealand-based Monk Fruit Corp. \u201cDairy processors should ask their suppliers to provide details of how they incorporate ethical sourcing into their business practices,\u201d he states, adding that \u201cthird-party certification can be helpful for reducing the administrative burden when verifying that suppliers are meeting the expected ethical standards.\u201d Company sustainability programs that establish standards and requirements for compliance and typically undergo audits on a yearly basis by independent third parties will further spotlight an adherence to ethical sourcing, Ede maintains. \u201cIt starts by partnering with a trusted supplier that offers sustainable, ethically sourced ingredients and transparent, traceable supply chains,\u201d he notes. Establishing baseline expectations for all suppliers, which can involve working with stakeholders and legal counsel to develop a supplier code of conduct, will strengthen ethical sourcing initiatives as well, IDFA\u2019s Aquino says. In addition, programs should have clearly defined, transparent, and, when applicable, science-based methodologies or criteria that is understandable to shoppers, he notes. \u201cIt is important to assess consumer familiarity with such programs in order to have sustainable sourcing certifications that build trust,\u201d Aquino states. Yet, operating in an ethical manner can be challenging. The absence of a single unified definition for ethical, responsible, or sustainable sourcing, for instance, is making it difficult for processors to identify and incorporate the optimal ingredients, Cargill\u2019s Clancy says. Animal welfare is a vital element in ethical sourcing decisions. Photo courtesy of Dairy Management Inc. \u201cThe proliferation of definitions and indicators for monitoring, along with the lack of standardization, is a key issue facing not just dairy processors but the entire industry,\u201d she notes. \u201cAs a result, making comparisons between the available solutions has become an unenviable task.\u201d Additional issues include tight supplies; uncertainty that consumers will notice and choose to pay for a differential product; the need to ensure that actions and communications will convey credibility with stakeholders; and having to instruct shoppers on standards and certifications, IDFA\u2019s Aquino says. Education is essential Indeed, 210 Analytics' Roerink notes \u201cthe real challenge and opportunity are to educate consumers and clear up a lot of the confusion in the marketplace. That\u2019s step one before the various production and sourcing methods can truly become differentiators.\u201d Such confusion includes uncertainty regarding the difference between \u201cfree range\u201d and \u201cpasture-raised\u201d products, and a lack of knowledge about regenerative agriculture, she states. \u201cI had one shopper speculate that regenerative agriculture is taking the cells of an animal and growing the meat in a laboratory,\u201d Roerink notes. \u201cThese are powerful reminders that industry jargon may not have the same meaning, and certainly not the impact, among consumers while demand for such products is growing.\u201d It also can be arduous for processors to confirm that all the necessary product ingredients have valid third-party ethical sourcing certifications, Martino says. \u201cAs sustainability is becoming more of a consumer priority, there\u2019s a lot of greenwashing going on and it isn\u2019t always easy to decipher what\u2019s really 'sustainable' without having oversight over your entire supply chain,\u201d Global Organics\u2019 Greenlee notes. \u201cIt\u2019s important to work with trusted suppliers who do their due diligence and vet their sources well.\u201d Processors also should team with suppliers that focus on ethically sourced ingredients, Cargill\u2019s Clancy suggests. \u201cResponsible sourcing efforts provide brands with visibility into their supply chains, giving manufacturers peace of mind, while further benefiting from the assurance that sustainability risks in the chain are being assessed and addressed,\u201d she explains. \u201cAt the same time, it provides opportunities to build credible brand stories, engage with consumers, and foster trust and brand preference.\u201d Dairy processors seeking ethically sourced ingredients, meanwhile, should first survey their existing suppliers as they \u201cmay be pleasantly surprised that many are already doing things the 'right way,'\u201d Global Organics\u2019 Martino says. Martino notes that operators also should give preferential treatment in the bid process to suppliers that ethically source. \u201cTreating a farmer or ingredient producer ethically often involves giving them more money as those farmers and producers should not be forced to match the bid from those with non-ethically produced goods,\u201d he suggests. While he says that it may be difficult for processors to locate all the necessary ingredients that have a valid third-party ethical sourcing certification, Greenlee concludes that there still are \u201cethical options for nearly any ingredient a processor is interested in sourcing.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

The sector generates up to 30 per cent of the total waste that goes to landfill sites in the province. A new task force is hoping to change that by exploring ways Manitoba can move toward greater recycling of CRD waste materials, diverting them from landfills and producing new products for use in a variety of ways. The task force will examine what\u2019s working well and consider options from other Canadian jurisdictions surrounding the reuse and recycling of construction materials. Members will also look for best practices to develop recommendations and engage with stakeholders to understand the issue from multiple perspectives. Chris Lorenc, president and CEO of the Manitoba Heavy Construction Association, is co-chair of the task force with Colleen Sklar, executive director of the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region. \u201cOur industry is looking forward to sharing its experiences and innovations, including in the recycling of concrete aggregates, asphalt, shingles, water used in the production of aggregates, steel rebar and the likes,\u201d Lorenc said. \u201cThe models we\u2019ve read about in use in other countries, provinces and municipalities can be used to guide our best efforts here in Manitoba. \u201cThe construction industry has been recycling select materials from road or other projects, but there are numerous materials that could be recovered and reused from broader construction activities to promote resource management and environmental stewardship.\u201d The task force will include participation from the City of Winnipeg, Association of Manitoba Municipalities, Winnipeg Construction Association and the Manitoba Home Builders\u2019 Association. It has been asked to submit a report with recommendations to the Manitoba government this fall. The group was launched because a waste diversion and recycling framework review completed in 2021 identified CRD activities create one of the largest waste streams in Manitoba. Manitoba has one of the lowest rates of CRD material recycling. The construction and demolition sector, in particular, is one of the largest resource consumers and waste producers in society, using up to 40 per cent of the total raw materials extracted globally and generating about 35 per cent of the world\u2019s waste. A 2015 study commissioned for Environment Canada estimated only 16 per cent of CRD waste was reused or recycled, while the remaining 84 per cent was disposed, mostly in landfills. But some jurisdictions have moved to adopt policies and practices for reclaiming and reusing construction and demolition waste. A provincial spokesperson said in a statement CRD waste represents four million tonnes, or 12 per cent, of the solid waste stream in Canada. \u201cReducing this waste stream extends the life of landfills, preserves finite resources, boosts the circular economy and reduces greenhouse emissions,\u201d the spokesperson said. According to the province, reduce, reuse, recycle and recover are key elements that underpin the transition towards a circular economy, where construction and other post-consumer waste materials are integrated back into use and production cycles. The process leads to better preservation of natural resources, a reduction in GHG emissions, and the generation of new economic opportunities for Manitoba, the spokesperson stated. The most prevalent types of materials that can be recycled are wood, which includes clean, engineered, treated or painted wood, asphalt roofing and drywall. Other materials include metals, plastics, concrete, asphalt paving, bricks, glass, cardboard, and certain rock, gravel and aggregates. The ability to recycle materials varies by region and depends on a number of factors such as processing capacity, end use and market value. The province expects a greater focus on recycling CRD waste materials will create new jobs around recycling. \u201cWaste diversion and recycling activities can create new green jobs,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cExploring opportunities to increase the circular economy in Manitoba, including the creation of new green jobs, is one of the objectives of the CRD task force.\u201d A final report with recommendations will be provided to Environment and Climate Minister Kevin Klein once the task force completes its work. \u201cConstruction, renovation and demolition waste is a major contributor to our landfills, so by diverting these materials through reuse and recycling, we help address the problem while protecting our environment,\u201d said Klein, noting diverting materials from the waste stream is a good deal for everybody. The benefits of greater recycling of CRD waste aligns with the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region\u2019s draft Plan 20-50, which will establish a regional approach supporting waste minimization, diversion and recycling. \u201cBuilding resiliency in our region is a key objective in Plan 20-50,\u201d said co-chair Sklar. \u201cThis starts with improved data sharing and good working relationships across all levels of government, which ensure sound decision-making and an environment of trust.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Evonik is making progress with the expansion of its DL-methionine production plant in Singapore. In order to reach an important milestone in the construction process, production at the Singapore plant on Jurong Island will be reduced for three months in Q4\/2023, followed by another three-month tie-in shutdown in the first half of 2024. This shutdown is part of the implementation of Evonik\u2019s methionine asset strategy to safeguard long-term global supply security. The expansion is proceeding as expected and the planned production stops in Q4\/2023 and H1\/2024, which are necessary for maintenance and safety reasons, will allow modifications to be made that would not be possible during day-to-day operations. \u201cWe fully understand that these shutdowns may pose challenges for our customers and our teams have prepared mitigation plans for MetAMINO\u00ae supply from our global production network. We are in continuous communication with regional and global customers to carefully plan shipments,\u201d said Noel Kim, regional vice president Animal Nutrition.
