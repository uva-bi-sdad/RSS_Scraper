Aligning with the initiative's guidelines, ZTE will establish science-based emission reduction targets in the near term and strive for long-term net-zero emissions. Over the course of 5-10 years, ZTE aims to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise limitation pathway and ultimately reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. At the commitment signing ceremony, Mr. Wang Xiang, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of ZTE, signed the pledge to the SBTi. Distinguished guests, including Mr. Lin Guoen, Vice Chairman of Deloitte China; Mr. Zhuang Binghan, Vice President of the Marketing Group at Intel; Mr. Hong Xiongbin, Regional General Manager of SGS Limited; and Mr. Ma Qi, Executive Deputy General Manager of Great Wall Power Technology Co., Ltd., representing valued suppliers, were in attendance, bearing witness to this significant milestone. SBTi is recognized as one of the world's most influential emission reduction mechanisms. Launched in 2015 by the collaboration of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), this initiative provides businesses with a well-defined and scientifically derived pathway to effectively reduce emissions.

The announcement of ZTE joining the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) this time marks a significant milestone in the Company's carbon neutrality journey. Following the introduction of its visionary \"Digital Economy Green Road\" strategy in 2021, ZTE is now committed to working closely with SBTi to develop tailored emission reduction action plans.
