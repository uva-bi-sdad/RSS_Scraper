Currently, the earth is about 1.1C warmer than in the late 1800s. As outlined in the Paris Agreement, the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, limit global warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably limit the increase to 1.5C by 2050. According to a new report by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), even if each country\u2019s climate change pledges are kept, global temperatures are projected to miss the mark and instead suggest a 2.8C hike by the end of the century. Despite the present energy crisis, inflation, economic uncertainty, and the war in Ukraine, companies face pressure from investors and consumers to reduce GHG emissions, which continue to intensify as temperatures rise. While this is true in many industries, it is magnified in the energy market as it has the biggest impact in both emitting GHG emissions and transitioning to green and clean energy. Another inescapable future is the demand for electricity, expected to triple by 2050 as living standards grow. All future scenarios point to renewable energy, particularly solar and wind, to lead the power generation mix by 2050. Along with batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), the unit cost of solar and wind continue to fall while their use continues to rise. However, as the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine have highlighted, there is a need for an energy source that is secure, produces low emissions, and is dispatchable. Nuclear may, for example, be the complement to renewable energy to transition to a more sustainable future. A key factor in accelerating this transition is using digital technologies to control product data for wind, solar, and nuclear. All companies run on product data\u2014it touches all phases of a product\u2019s\/plant\u2019s lifecycle. Those that can harness their data outperform their competition. They\u2019re able to innovate, scale, and transform, merging their digitalization efforts sustainably and making them more resilient competitors in the marketplace. They do this with a strategic business approach known as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). Although PLM is often associated with engineering and software systems, generally known as \u201cPLM solutions,\u201d PLM is a much broader strategic approach to managing all aspects of the product, services, and processes directly linked to the business strategy. It supports the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, and use of product definition information, supporting the extended enterprise (that is, customers, design, operations, supply partners, etc.) as it spans from concept through end of life of a product or plant. PLM integrates people, processes, business systems, and information that empowers the business, enables product and process innovation, and enhances both top- and bottom-line business performance. Wind turbine manufacturers, for example, use PLM to control the configuration of their product in both their new product introduction process, as well as their requisition-to-order processes, customer requirements, and other regulations. They make use of PLM solutions, product configurators, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and other digital solutions to manage all the components, materials, and processes that make up a wind turbine. Each wind turbine is comprised of thousands of parts, including software, much of which comes from an upstream supply chain regularly consisting of more than a thousand suppliers. For any given order, these parts or, in some cases, functions are configured with PLM, resulting in a bill-of-material (BOM) throughout various phases of the product\u2019s lifecycle. The after-service market is crucial in the wind industry. Therefore, using PLM to create digital twins\u2014virtual replicas of these physical assets, which are kept up to date throughout service\u2014is critical not just for performance, but also to increase efficiency and provide useful insights for future services, upgrades, retirement, and new products. Wind and solar companies are some of the most sustainable in the world. In both January 2022 and 2023, Corporate Knights (a Toronto, Canada\u2013based sustainable-economy media and research company) named Vestas, the largest wind turbine provider, as the \u201cmost sustainable corporation in the world\u201d from a list of 6,720 publicly traded companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. Vestas is committed to being a carbon-neutral company by 2030 without using carbon offsets and by producing zero-waste wind turbines by 2040. To accomplish this, Vestas, and competitors such as GE Vernova, Siemens Gamesa, and others are incorporating circular design concepts, reducing carbon emissions, and reducing waste production from manufacturing. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of the GHG emission is locked in during product design. Therefore, wind original equipment manufacturers are making concerted efforts from the outset to design sustainability into their products with the end of life in mind. To accomplish this, they are making greater use of digital threads\u2014the ability to connect product data flow and achieve an integrated view of an asset\u2019s data (that is, its digital twin) throughout its lifecycle across traditionally siloed functional domains. Another key is reducing the product carbon footprint (PCF). So, for each component or material they need to know the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e). This extends into their supply chain where up to 99% of their carbon footprint is typically embedded in their product manufacturing process. PLM can increase the visibility of the product carbon footprint of the materials used, including those from suppliers, thus reducing the environmental impact. Vestas is also pursuing a zero-waste product by 2040. While 80% of their average wind turbine can already be fully recycled or repurposed, there are challenges for the turbine rotors where composite components made of epoxy resin and fibers make it more difficult to recycle cost effectively. \u201cIntegrating sustainability into everything we do is a part of our vision to become the global leader in sustainable energy solutions. This also includes our ambition to be the safest, most-inclusive, and socially responsible company in the energy industry. We want to create a place to work where a diverse workforce of people thrive, grow, and feel that they belong,\u201d said Brian Lindgaard Jensen, vice president with Vestas. The solar industry, entailing solar panels or photovoltaic panels (PV), uses PLM in a similar fashion and is similarly challenged designing for sustainability with an increasing emphasis on waste reduction and recycling at the end of a solar project\u2019s lifespan. A 2016 study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates the recyclable materials in old solar modules will be worth $15 billion in recoverable assets by the year 2050. The two primary solar technologies are crystalline silicon, with most of the market share, and thin-film PV, which is used for applications such as building rooftops. Many of the materials that make up PV panels could be highly recyclable. Glass composes most of the weight of a solar panel (about 75%) and glass recycling is already a well-established industry. Other materials that are easily recyclable include the aluminum frame, copper wire, and the plastic junction boxes. The challenge is that existing products were designed for durability with polymer layers that seal the panels from exposure to the elements. The lack of designing for disassembly requires that existing designs require thermal processing at 500C to loosen the adhesive. In Europe, which has a more mature solar industry, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) of the European Union helped found a member-based organization called PV Cycle to build out a robust recycling infrastructure. Although similar regulations are expected in the U.S., as of now, only Washington state has passed legislation requiring manufacturers of PV modules to provide for recycling. Leading thin-film solar manufacturer First Solar started a voluntary recycling program in 2006 and continues to perfect its processes. Today, the company recovers more than 90% of the semiconductor material for reuse in new solar modules. It also recovers 90% of the glass for reuse in new glass container products. As the renewable energy market continues to grow, the use of PLM throughout a circular product lifecycle that spans from raw material sourcing through end-of-life recycling, recovery, and remanufacturing will be critical. And, not only through enhancement with digital twins, digital thread, and configuration management, but also in collaboration across many functions both within the company and with customers and their supply chain. In addition to renewables, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in energy prices has highlighted the need for countries to rethink their energy security strategy. The need for a more diverse and domestic supply of energy is clear, leading to a resurgence in nuclear power. Historically, nuclear power has been cost-prohibitive compared to coal and natural gas, but the combination of the need for energy security, additional low-carbon emissions, and flexible baseload power that can supplement renewable energy is key. Nuclear energy provides 413 GW of capacity operating in 32 countries while avoiding 1.5 gigatonnes (Gt) of GHG emissions and 180 billion cubic meters (bcm) of global gas demand each year. As a result, many counties are scaling back their plans to phase out nuclear, and others, such as the UK, are planning for new reactors. Many of these plants were originally designed more than 40 years ago, before PLM was broadly accepted, but PLM is being adopted, typically during retrofits. So, as an example, if a unit gets a new steam turbine designed using PLM, the utility company can use this data to help them manage their power plant more efficiently. When it comes to older plants, the use of PLM and modern asset management largely comes down to the choice for more efficiency and improved data consistency. The challenge of net zero has also intensified the development in small modular reactor (SMR) technologies. SMRs, generally defined as advanced nuclear reactors with a capacity of less than 300 MW, have strong political and institutional support, with substantial grants in the U.S., and increased support in Canada, the UK, and France. However, SMRs have not yet proven to be financially viable, and few will be online before 2030. That said, they are attracting private investors, they will have lower capital costs, inherent safety and waste management attributes, and reduced project risks may improve social acceptance. The companies investing in advanced SMR technology, such as NuScale Power, GE-Hitachi Energy, and others, use PLM, and in some cases enable almost all their employees to access data under configuration control. The reason for this is the requirements, quality, safety, and other data and documentation required for licensing are interrelated and critical to their business. While the scale may be different from wind turbines and solar plants, and the regulatory requirements more stringent, the PLM concepts and technologies are quite similar. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report highlighted that global CO 2 emissions continue to rise at unprecedented levels. Energy companies need to accelerate their innovation, reduce their PCFs, implement more circular waste reduction, and do so while keeping their costs down with greater collaboration, which is exactly what increased digitalization and PLM offer. We are witnessing the most dramatic transition in energy and the markets impacted by energy in our lifetime. PLM is playing a key role in accelerating the transition to green energy and a decarbonized, sustainable, and circular economy that will benefit our businesses, our customers, and the future of our planet for generations to come. \u2014Mark Reisig is executive consultant, and Sustainability and Green Energy practice director, with CIMdata.","filter_flag":1}

The world-renowned investors will also act as strategic partners for GeoPura as it scales its hydrogen power generation technology. GeoPura currently provides hydrogen power to Balfour Beatty, HS2, National Grid and the BBC among other sustainability-driven customers, replacing traditional diesel generators with its Hydrogen Power Unit (HPU) technology. The HPUs are used for temporary, supplementary, off grid and backup power. GeoPura plans to grow the use of hydrogen into other hard-to-decarbonise areas of our energy system, such as EV charging and supplementary grid power, as economies continue to electrify. With hubs in Nottingham and Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK, the \u00a336m investment will enable GeoPura to mass manufacture HPUs alongside partner Siemens Energy, increase the production of green hydrogen to fuel the units and drive green skills in the North East and throughout the UK, while supporting the global deployment of the technology. GeoPura plans to deploy a fleet of over 3,600 HPUs by 2033, providing clean, low-cost reliable power, and displacing more than six million tonnes of CO 2 emissions through their operation over their life. In response to customer demand, the company aims to bring a number of new products to market, addressing smaller and larger power requirements. The company will work closely with its new strategic partners to advance the technology needed to enable the mass electrification that underpins decarbonisation. Andrew Cunningham, CEO of GeoPura, said: \u201cGreen hydrogen is too often seen as a technology that will happen in the future, but GeoPura and our partners are delivering a commercially viable technology, today. The world can\u2019t afford to wait a decade for green fuels to scale \u2013 we must act now. \u201cThis investment allows us to build on our installed base of HPUs and hydrogen production infrastructure to stimulate the green hydrogen economy, and then expand the use of clean fuels into other hard-to-decarbonise areas of our energy system. \u201cWe have secured the right mix of investors, forming strategic partnerships that not only provide the funds to enable us to scale rapidly, but also the skills and resources to accelerate the transition to zero emission fuels. With the support of our investors we can help turn the market on its head and build a green hydrogen economy this decade, not next.\u201d \u201cThe need for green hydrogen energy solutions is expanding as a wide range of customers move toward replacing diesel-powered sources,\u201d said Wade Sheffer, Managing Director, GM Ventures. \u201cOur investment in GeoPura demonstrates our focus on scaling breakthrough innovations that can advance sustainability, while supporting GM\u2019s progress toward an all-electric, zero-emissions future. GeoPura\u2019s HPUs and GM\u2019s HYDROTEC fuel cell expertise have the potential to provide better energy solutions across industries.\u201d James Ferrier, Director, Principal Investments, Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital said: \u201cBuilding low-carbon capacity and capability in our energy supply is key for a timely transition to net-zero. Whilst most of the focus in the UK is rightly on 'greening' our energy grid, industries which are reliant on fossil-fuel powered generators - such as construction, film production and events - should not be forgotten. Establishing tailored methods of off-grid green energy generation such as GeoPura\u2019s Hydrogen Power Unit technology will be crucial for the decarbonisation of these industries, and we are excited to support GeoPura as they begin to scale.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier, Investment Director at SWEN CP, said: \u201cSWEN CP, through its impact strategy dedicated to renewable gas infrastructures in Europe, is proud to support the growth of GeoPura and to enable carbon emission reductions in hard to abate sectors. We believe that the quality of the team, the robustness of the technology and the strategic partnership with Siemens Energy are the perfect ingredients to make GeoPura a successful solution to tackle climate change.\u201d Kendra Rauschenberger, General Partner at Siemens Energy Ventures, said: \u201cHaving worked alongside GeoPura from the early days, it has been incredible to see the development of this business as more customers turn to utilizing green hydrogen for their sustainable energy needs and commitments. At Siemens Energy Ventures, our focus is on building, investing in and scaling up start-ups that can make a real difference to the complex energy transition our world is facing. Our strategic investment, alongside the investments from all partners, make GeoPura ready for its next phase of rapid growth. We look forward to being part of the journey.\u201d Green hydrogen is widely recognised as essential to achieve global climate goals, potentially supplying 25% of energy demand by 2050, with a $10tn addressable market, according to Goldman Sachs[1]. The UK government has set its own target to hit 10GW of low carbon hydrogen capacity this decade. However, there remain limited commercial technologies able to capitalise on this demand. GeoPura set out to prove green hydrogen as a commercially viable solution, today, to replace existing fossil fuels. Established to decarbonise global economies using zero-emission fuels, GeoPura has grown rapidly since delivering its first Hydrogen Power Unit (HPU) in collaboration with Siemens Energy in 2019. GeoPura\u2019s HPU technology and end-to-end service is a multi-purpose replacement for diesel power worldwide and is available today. GeoPura generates hydrogen and transports the fuel to customers for use in its HPUs \u2013 customers simply rent the units and pay for the fuel used. The company is initially targeting sectors with the highest diesel use today, such as construction, infrastructure, outdoor events, and back-up power. It is also providing a solution to power commercial EV charging, where the local electricity network isn\u2019t capable. The only by-product is pure water and heat.

Combining newly discovered chemical technology developed within the CETEC initiative, and partnerships with Olin and Stena Recycling, the solution can be applied to blades currently in operation. Once matured, this will eliminate the need for blade redesign, or landfill disposal of epoxy-based blades when they are decommissioned. \u201cUntil now, the wind industry has believed that turbine blade material calls for a new approach to design and manufacture to be either recyclable, or beyond this, circular, at end of life. Going forward, we can now view old epoxy-based blades as a source of raw material. Once this new technology is implemented at scale, legacy blade material currently sitting in landfill, as well as blade material in active windfarms, can be disassembled, and re-used. This signals a new era for the wind industry, and accelerates our journey towards achieving circularity,\u201d says Lisa Ekstrand, Vice President and Head of Sustainability at Vestas. Turbine blades have previously been challenging to recycle due to the chemical properties of epoxy resin, a resilient substance that was believed to be impossible to break down into re-usable components. This has led to many technology leaders attempting to replace or modify epoxy resin with alternatives that can be more easily treated. Vestas\u2019 solution is enabled by a novel chemical process that can chemically break down epoxy resin into virgin-grade materials. The chemical process was developed in collaboration with Aarhus University, Danish Technological Institute, and Olin the partners of the CETEC project, a coalition of industry and academia established to investigate circular technology for turbine blades. \u201cThe newly discovered chemical process shows that epoxy-based turbine blades, whether in operation or sitting in landfill, can be turned into a source of raw material to potentially build new turbine blades. As the chemical process relies on widely available chemicals, it is highly compatible for industrialisation, and can therefore be scaled up quickly. This innovation would not have been possible without the ground-breaking CETEC collaboration between industry and academia enabling our progress until this point,\u201d says Mie Elholm Birkbak, Specialist, Innovation & Concepts at Vestas. Through a newly established value chain, supported by Nordic recycling leader Stena Recycling and global epoxy manufacturer Olin, Vestas will now focus on scaling up the novel chemical disassembly process into a commercial solution. Once mature, the solution will signal the beginning of a circular economy for all existing, and future epoxy-based turbine blades. \u201cAs the leading customer solution provider of innovative epoxy systems, Olin is proud to support the anticipated massive expansion in wind energy worldwide. By utilising unique technologies, together with our partners, we are ready to recover molecules and convert them into new epoxies that can be re-used in wind turbine blades. We are excited to bring our expertise and unique asset footprint to this partnership, and realize breakthrough sustainable material solutions for existing wind blades and those of the future\u201d, says Verghese Thomas, Vice President, Epoxy Systems and Growth Platforms at Olin. \u201cIn the coming years, thousands of turbines will be decommissioned or repowered, representing a major sustainability challenge but also a valuable source of composite materials. As one of Europe\u2019s leading recycling groups with a wide footprint in Europe, we have a central role in the transition to a circular economy. We see this solution as a huge opportunity to take part in making a sustainable solution even more sustainable and circular and are ready to apply our chemical recycling expertise and knowledge to this process\u201d, says Henrik Grand Petersen, MD Stena Recycling Denmark. For several decades, producing wind turbine blades manufactured with epoxy-based resin has been standard practice in the wind industry. In the most mature markets for wind energy, the first turbines are reaching the end of their operational life and this will increase over the coming years. WindEurope expects around 25,000 tonnes of blades to reach the end of their operational life annually by 2025. Once mature, the new solution will provide Vestas with the opportunity to produce new turbine blades made from re-used blade material. In the future, the new solution also signals the possibility to make all epoxy-based composite material a source of raw material for a broader circular economy, potentially encompassing industries beyond wind energy.

The study is the first known report of a working lithium-ion battery assembled using polymers upcycled from PET plastics, which are used to make plastic bottles. The study was published in Journal of Materials Chemistry A in November 2022. Plastic waste is a mounting problem in the world today, and it is set to grow bigger with the rising demand for plastics. 460 million tons of plastics were produced globally in 2019, but only 9% are recycled, with the remainder either being incinerated or disposed in landfills and the environment[1]. Plastic waste is conventionally recycled through mechanical and chemical processes, which have their drawbacks. For mechanical recycling, only a small proportion of recycled PET can eventually be used, as their physical properties degrade with each round of recycling due to polymer chain cleavage. Chemical recycling involves high energy usage, requires purified monomers and can be more costly compared to using virgin polymers. \u201cUpcycling waste plastics is a new strategy to give these ubiquitous yet commonly discarded materials a new lease of life to transform them into value-added new products for novel applications. PET plastics offer great potential for upcycling due to their well-established existing waste collection infrastructure and relatively uncomplicated waste streams,\u201d said Dr Derrick Fam, Deputy Head of the Polymer Composites department at A*STAR\u2019s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), who led this study together with Dr Jason Lim, Deputy Head of the Soft Materials department at IMRE. \u201cThere is a rise in demand for sustainably-sourced materials for lithium-ion batteries due to greater electrification. However, the use of waste PET plastics as a resource for polymer electrolytes has never been achieved till now. This represents our first attempt to upcycle waste PET plastics for this application\u201d, said Dr Lim. UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF PET: CAPITALISING ON EXISTING PROPERTIES Amongst the different types of plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most abundant plastics produced today, amounting to 31 million tonnes in 2019[2]. PET plastics possess existing features that make them suitable to be upcycled into polymer electrolytes (PEs). They are made up of rigid terephthalate components, which contribute to their excellent mechanical properties and can be tapped on to enhance PEs\u2019 mechanical robustness, which in turn facilitates device integration and fabrication. In addition, they possess easily breakable chemical bonds which allow these polymers to be repurposed into new chemical building blocks with ease. These can then be reconstituted into new polymers for fresh applications. FROM BOTTLES TO BATTERIES: REVOLUTIONISING BATTERY DESIGN Waste PET bottles were used by the team to design polyurethane-based PEs. Compared to conventional liquid electrolytes currently used in LiBs, PEs are promising alternative components in batteries that have the potential to eliminate safety hazards such as the risks of electrolyte leakage, uncontrolled heating, volume expansion, dendrite growth and fire hazards. After assessing the viability of the PET-derived polymers as solid polymer electrolytes, the team further evaluated their ionic conductivity and cycling performance when used as gel polymer electrolytes for LiBs. Findings from the study showed the potential of the polyurethanes derived from waste PET as polymer electrolytes for LiBs. They achieved a room temperature conductivity of 10-4 S\/cm as a gel-polymer electrolyte (GPE), which is comparable to existing commercial systems containing liquid electrolytes. The team also successfully assembled a working LiB using these polymers, and showed that cells can be repeatedly charged and discharged up to 150 cycles. Their promising performance paves the way for a future powered by more sustainable energy, where PET plastic waste can be transformed into PE materials for batteries, creating a circular economy while combating the mounting plastic waste issue.

The most powerful thing we have as consumers is choice, and each decision is an opportunity to make a difference. Here\u2019s our round-up of London\u2019s best sustainable beauty salons. The Best Spas in the UK London\u2019s Best Sustainable Beauty Salons 2022 Blue Tit Blue Tit is the first hairdressing salon group in Europe to become B Corp certified. In the last year alone, the salon has offset 110 per cent of its emissions, created a transparent impact report (which you can find here) and prevented over 10,000 plastic bottles from entering landfill or ocean waters. The salon is also in the process of switching its electricity supply to Haven Power, which generates energy using responsibly sourced, compressed wood pellets and produces 86 per cent less carbon than coal-generated energy, and uses biodegradable towels from Scrummi and Eco Head shower heads to help save water \u2013 a big issue to tackle when hundred of heads of hair are washed in the salon each day. BOOK IT: bluetitlondon.com Neil Moodie Studio UK hairstylist Neil Moodie \u2013 whose clients include Nicola Coughlan, Jodie Comer and Claire Foy \u2013 has opened a new conscious hair salon in East London, marking the stylist\u2019s first solo venture. Neil\u2019s goal is to offer incredible hair cutting and colouring, serviced as consciously as possible and accessible to all. Stylists are trained in all hair types, prices are gender neutral (with costs reflecting the level of service received) and the studio has partnered with the Green Salon Collective to uphold sustainability standards. Think Eco Head taps, sustainable energy, Scrummi compostable hair towels and Vish colour weighing scales to reduce waste. BOOK IT: neilmoodiestudio.com Butchers Salon Since their Hackney salon opened in 2014, Butchers have been proving that ethical hair cuts can still be cutting edge. With tables repurposed out of wooden crates, fluorescent tube lighting, and ivy draped steel pipes supporting shelves of shampoo, their city-chic meets sustainability d\u00e9cor is the height of cool. It\u2019s also sustainable, with products and furnishings provided by local businesses. The same goes for the guest experience, which marries eco-conscious choices with modern comforts. Expect an iPad on arrival (instead of paper-wasting magazines), a biodegradable towel, plant-based refreshments and a playlist of independent artists to listen to while you sit back and enjoy your complementary aromatherapy experience (comes free with every treatment). If this wasn\u2019t cool enough, all their treatments are gender-neutral with gender-neutral pricing. Based on their new Hoxton branch and the third Camden salon in the pipeline, it\u2019s clear Butcher\u2019s formula for trendy sustainability is a hit \u2013 you\u2019ll walk away feeling beautiful inside and out. BOOK IT: butchersalon.com STILL London Tranquility is the last thing you\u2019d expect to encounter in Dalston but that\u2019s exactly what STILL London is; a slice of peace on an otherwise bustling street. Since its quiet opening, the inconspicuous spot has drawn in East Londoners with its crystal laden window displays of Sao Paulo incense and jade rollers galore. The first thing you notice upon entering, other than the heavenly scent of incense burning, is a small and stylish nail bar where nail technicians offer vegan manicures using only non-toxic polishes, delivering natural options without making concessions on quality and colour. In the back of the salon, though, is where the real magic happens. Behind sliding doors you\u2019ll find The Treatment Room, a small space where Daisy, the studio\u2019s holistic facial and massage therapist, utilises massage, energy healing, reflexology and all-natural products to refresh your soul and treat your skin. Describing itself as low tech; high vibe, you shouldn\u2019t expect any invasive procedures during the facial, but you\u2019ll still definitely leave the salon with an all over glow from the inside out. BOOK IT: still-london.com Buller and Rice Founded by the owner of London\u2019s first ever sustainable salon comes Buller and Rice, the salon paving the path for sustainability with their all-in approach to eco beauty. From the design of the salon, which utilises designs like bio laminate (a material made of grass cutting) and Smile Plastics (a surface made entirely of 100 per cent recycled yoghurt pots) to their Who Gives a Crap bamboo toilet paper, everything in this salon is kind to the earth in an industry that\u2019s notoriously not. When it comes to your hair, Buller and Rice pride themselves on using solely eco, sustainable and bio-dynamic line, as well as their non-branded re-fill bar which allows customers to bring in any empty pot, tube or tub into the salon to be filled with their choice of product, encouraging clients to reuse all their packaging. You can feel smug knowing everything down to the foil used in dying treatments (or rather Paper Not Foil) is reusable. From the beginning of summer 2019 Buller and Rice will be partnering with Matter of Trust to recycle hair clippings and donate them to aid the clean up of major oil spills \u2013 who knew human hair was so good at absorbing oil? The salon\u2019s sustainability credentials are long and illustrious; it\u2019s an A+ from us. BOOK IT: bullerandrice.com Cloud Twelve A haven of serenity is the last thing you\u2019d expect to find in busy Notting Hill, but tucked away in a secluded mews amidst pretty-in-pink houses is exactly that. Cloud Twelve is a sanctuary of wellness, and the club\u2019s spa is a heavenly scented, luxurious and most importantly, sustainable distillation of that. Just reading the treatment menu eases our tensions and while you\u2019ll want to try everything from the lymphatic rose crystal facial to the Himalayan salt scrub, the spa\u2019s range of massages are a must. Once robed and slippered, you\u2019ll head to the waiting room where instead of white lights and a clinical feel, you\u2019ll find a gorgeous cocoon where you can quite literally feel your worries evaporating. Spacious, calming and dimly lit, Cloud Twelve\u2019s treatment rooms are also built for prime relaxation and their expert therapists, knowledgeable and intuitive, deliver a treatment with a difference. From the optional heated massage bed to the calming sound bath and naturally fragranced oils, it\u2019s an experience from start to finish, and what\u2019s more is you can rest assured knowing that everything in the spa is as sustainable as it is indulgent. All treatments are performed using plant-based and ethically sourced materials and products, with all partnering brands being eco-sustainable, non-toxic and highly effective.

As sustainable beauty salons go, Cloud Twelve\u2019s Spa shows that luxurious spa treatments don\u2019t have to cost the earth. BOOK IT: The spa is open to both members and non-members; cloudtwelve.co.uk Glasshouse Salon Glasshouse Salon is ideally situated for a spot of relaxation after braving the crowds on a Saturday morning at Broadway Market. While the sparse industrial interiors are more Scandi minimalist than the lush greenery you\u2019d expect of an eco-conscious salon, don\u2019t be fooled, Glasshouse Salon takes sustainability seriously. In terms of hair care, the salon uses a professional colour range that\u2019s made locally in the UK with energy efficient methods and a low carbon footprint, using a formula that\u2019s ammonia and resorcinol free and packaged in post-consumer recyclable packaging.
