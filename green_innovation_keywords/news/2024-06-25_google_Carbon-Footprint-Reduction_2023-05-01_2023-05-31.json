Chemical manufacturer BASF has taken a leading role in managing carbon emissions throughout the company and is diligently working to better adhere to the principles of environmental sustainability. To learn more about how BASF is working to implement carbon management and procedures within its own supply chain and throughout ingredient production processes, including the launch of a digital application tool to calculate Product Carbon Footprints for its 45,000 sales products, CosmeticsDesign spoke with Prerna Chatterjee, Senior Sustainability Manager at BASF for her insights. The importance of carbon management Within the cosmetics and personal care industries, carbon management in support of environmentally sustainable practice implementation is essential, Chatterjee asserted. The practice can \u201chave a significant impact on the environment, as a large portion of the manufacturer\u2019s carbon footprint is attributed to Scope 3 emissions, which are not produced by the company itself, but by those that it's indirectly responsible for, up and down its value chain\u200b,\u201d she said. This underscores the imperative relevance of carbon management to industry stakeholders, because \u201cas suppliers to the beauty industry we engage in strategies & implementation techniques that reduce the overall carbon footprint of our activities & products\u200b,\u201d she shared. Further, carbon management matters a great deal to the consumer or product\u2019s end-user. It is well understood that \u201cwith transparency and traceability on the rise, consumers are seeking more information about \u2018how\u2019 their product is being produced\u200b,\u201d she explained. Now more than ever, consumers understand their role in supporting environmentally sustainable practices through their purchasing power by \u201cdriving demand for more sustainable products and influencing industry.\u201d This influence can be exerted \u201cby choosing to purchase products that use sustainable sourced ingredients to help reduce the carbon footprint of the cosmetic and beauty industry, which can also encourage manufacturers to prioritize sustainability and work towards reducing the footprint\u200b,\u201d she added. Ultimately, \u201cconsumers have an important role to play in driving sustainability in the beauty and cosmetics industry, and being aware about companies\u2019 carbon management practices is one aspect of this\u200b,\u201d she continued. Challenges to carbon management implementation Unfortunately, the implementation process of carbon management practices is necessarily simple, and there are many challenges that ingredients manufacturers and suppliers face when approaching this process. First and foremost, \u201cthe personal care industry has a complex and global supply chain, which can make it difficult to trace and calculate the exact carbon footprint of products\u200b,\u201d Chatterjee explained. Additionally, \u201csome sustainable materials\/feedstocks are often not widely available, which can impact on our ability to make big impacts\u200b\u201d and add to the potential challenges, she shared. Further impacting the feasibility of some carbon management solutions is that \u201ccommunicating about sustainability initiatives and progress can be challenging, requiring a high level of accountability and transparency\u200b,\u201d she explained. As a solution to directly address these issues, \u201ccompanies must be able to clearly communicate the sustainability benefits of their products and ingredients, as well as their overall carbon management strategies to consumers and stakeholders\u200b,\u201d she offered. Ultimately, overcoming these challenges to carbon management implementation requires a \u201ccollaborative effort from companies, suppliers, regulators, and consumers to develop more sustainable and transparent practices in the personal care industry\u200b\u201d with successful outcomes. Carbon management at BASF Despite these challenges, as a global entity BASF recognizes its responsibility for climate protection and has committed to further reducing emissions from its production processes. To achieve its goals, the company has set some ambitious quantitative objectives to measure progress. \u201cAt the heart of the long-term transition towards our net zero CO2 emissions goal by 2050 is the use of new technologies, which will replace fossil fuels such as natural gas with electricity from renewable sources\u200b,\u201d Chatterjee shared. While \u201cmost of these technologies are being pioneered by BASF in collaboration with partners and are currently in a pilot stage\u200b,\u201d the company \u201ccontinues to systematically implement continuous improvement processes for existing production plants\u200b\u201d to accelerate the timeline for successful implementation of its carbon management practices, she explained. Further, \u201cBASF has developed a digital application tool to calculate the cradle-to-gate PCFs (Product Carbon Footprints) for its 45,000 sales products, which enables the company to provide PCFs for its global portfolio\u200b,\u201d she added. This affords BASF customers the ability to \u201creceive valuable information about the extent to which BASF materials contribute to the carbon footprint of their business activities and their own final products\u200b.\u201d Based on GHG emissions from BASF plant, coupled with \u201chigh-quality average data for purchased raw materials as well as purchased energy\u200b,\u201d BASF\u2019s PCF calculations \u201ccomprise all product-related greenhouse gas emissions that occur until the BASF product leaves the factory gate for the customer: from the purchased raw material to the use of energy in production processes\u200b,\u201d she said. Through the combination of technological innovation and PCF data, BASF is well on its way to achieving its goal of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. As BASF is setting an industry example through its practices, it will be interesting to see if other global leaders in chemical production will follow suit with their own carbon management programs in the coming months.","filter_flag":1}

The Oregon Coast boasts all the natural resources a local seafood industry could want, but a lack of infrastructure prevents them from reaching Oregonians. Over the past year, the Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA) celebrated massive strides on its mission to keep more local seafood local. Oregon\u2019s oceans sustain over 150 commercially landed fish species (Source: ODFW) and a rich mariculture, raising the question: If seafood is so abundant, why exactly is it so difficult for visitors, locals and businesses to acquire? \u201cCurrently, our seafood is primarily exported to commodity wholesale markets, providing little opportunity for smaller processors to get in the game and sell our local product locally,\u201d explains Marcus Hinz, Executive Director, OCVA. \u201cA friend of mine once said, \u2018Back in my village, we feed ourselves first, then we sell the rest of our fish.\u2019 I hope Oregon can get to a place like that. We\u2019re not against export markets, but today we are just a seafood extraction economy.\u201d A staggering 90 percent of the seafood sold and consumed along the coast is not from Oregon. An OCVA-funded study revealed that if Oregon could retain just 10 percent more seafood to sell locally, it would translate into $90 million a year for coastal communities. An estimated $252 million of economic leakage annually occurs along the Oregon Coast due to the sale of food that is not local (Source: OCVA). \u201cWe need a multiplicity of small- and medium-scale buyers to be successful,\u201d adds Laura Anderson, Founder and CFO, Local Ocean, a locally sourced seafood restaurant and market. \u201cThis provides healthy competition in the marketplace, forces innovation in product development and ultimately is better for fishers and seafood lovers.\u201d Laura Anderson from the Yaquina Lab project speaking about OCI at Oregon Sea Grant conference called \u201cState of the Coast.\u201d OCVA has dozens of campaigns and initiatives centered on boosting access to Oregon Coast seafood through new infrastructure, coordinated distribution, innovation and awareness. \u201cIn the long term, it\u2019s the smartest thing we could possibly do because no other type of investment is going to contribute to local food security, enhanced community nutrition, emergency preparedness, economic development and carbon footprint reduction,\u201d Hinz notes. To overcome a lack of local seafood, OCVA prioritizes the immediate need for small-scale hyperlocal processing, storage and distribution infrastructure. Hyperlocal Seafood Infrastructure Seafood demands immediate attention once pulled from the ocean, meaning that every port involved with \u201clanding\u201d seafood requires some degree of infrastructure to keep fish fresh. The 2,500-square-foot Yaquina Lab in Newport, OR\u2014supported in part by OCVA\u2014was launched last year to address the needs of small-scale seafood producers. A shared-use space, the Lab gives its tenants the ability to process, store and distribute their catch. These services, can give fishers more options to sell direct and local. Commercial Fisher Brian Trotter showing off his catch of Oregon Black Rockfish The facility features two 40-foot Conex coolers for cold storage, a filet room for processing and rentable coworking space for the industry\u2019s small businesses, who are already reaping the benefits \u201cIn the first year, Local Ocean was able to double its direct from boat purchases of local rockfish, lingcod, black cod and halibut,\u201d recalls Anderson, who also runs Yaquina Lab\u2019s programming. \u201cThe restaurant building simply did not have the space for us to receive, fillet and freeze as much fish as we can sell.\u201d Given Yaquina Lab\u2019s popularity, OCVA hopes to see the pilot model rolled out along the coast. As it enters year two, its expanding to add seaweed culture and live crab facilities, a blast freezer and cooler, and more fillet space. For fresh-caught seafood, live holding tanks present another critical piece of the puzzle, providing an alternative to immediate processing. When rough seas prevent small fishers from deploying, live tanks let them continue supplying fresh product to local restaurants. \u201cIf we install dozens of live tanks, someone will need to be trained to keep the product alive,\u201d Hinz explains. \u201cSo, we wrote a grant for Oregon Coast Community College Aquarium Science Program to see if they could build out a commercial live tank training and certification program.\u201d Coordinated Logistics & Distribution Infrastructure comprises half of the availability equation. The other half boils down to distribution: getting seafood products to buyers and consumer markets in a cost-effective way. To coordinate regional distribution, reduce transportation costs and create shared marketing and infrastructure opportunities, OCVA works with the Oregon Food Hub Network, which helps develop regional food systems. North Coast Commons in Wheeler, Oregon, is another key distribution partner. Along with Yaquina Lab, it functions as a distribution hub from which the Visitors Association helps coordinate transportation routes into larger markets. North Coast Commons, a food aggregation hub OCVA is helping to connect with other regional distribution routes In 2022, OCVA subsidized and supported three new delivery routes that link coastal communities to Portland, paving the way for further regional collaboration with Hood River and Bend. According to Hinz, the success of local food systems depends on local partners, such as Port Orford Sustainable Seafood, which bridges connections between traceable hook and line caught seafood with Oregon consumers via pickup locations around the state. \u201cOur CSF asks members to pay a minimum of $200 upfront for a \u2018share\u2019 of Port Orford caught seafood that they get to choose over the course of a year,\u201d explains Michael Baran, Co-owner, Port Orford Sustainable Seafood. \u201cHowever, paying upfront isn\u2019t always possible, and a partnership with OCVA has allowed for us to develop the infrastructure necessary to transform the front of our processing facility into an open-air type storefront.\u201d This allows anyone to easily purchase the catch of the day or a prepared seafood meal. To map the industry\u2019s distribution and infrastructure needs, OCVA launched the Oregon Seafood Prospector, a geographic information systems tool that lets stakeholders visualize the coast\u2019s fishery data, activities and impact. It illustrates the fish landing in each port and the processing options along the coast. Endless Room for Seafood Innovation With the necessary infrastructure to keep local seafood local, a new market for innovation arises: \u201cWhen we immediately ship fish out of the state, entrepreneurs don\u2019t have the opportunity to try to create a value-added product,\u201d Hinz explains. By keeping local seafood local, OCVA expects to see a rise in innovative new products. It wrote $50,000 into its USDA grant for Oregon State University\u2019s Food Innovation Center so that small businesses wanting to create a seafood product could get support in the science of processing, packaging, experimentation and testing. A seafood business is currently working with them to create food products from a waste byproduct. \u201cOregon has a massive opportunity to innovate because, unlike other states, we have just begun to think about it,\u201d Hinz adds. \u201cWe have millions of miles to go in fully using our seafood resources, and people are itching to make this happen.\u201d Raising Awareness & Celebrating Local Seafood In the meantime, OCVA\u2019s awareness campaigns correct myths surrounding the industry, particularly the visitor\u2019s assumption that seafood eaten along the coast is local. Instead, Oregon\u2019s high-quality, nutrient dense seafood gets exported elsewhere, while imported products, of which only one percent undergo inspection (Source: US Government Accountability Office), arrive from markets driven by seafood slavery (Source: WalkFree.org) and illegal harvesting practices. \u201cQuite a few of our fisheries are third party sustainability-certified. It\u2019s the best on the planet and we\u2019re sending it away,\u201d Hinz says. \u201cVisitors to the Oregon Coast and residents of Oregon all want access to locally caught seafood. The demand is there. We just have to replace the product on the menu.\u201d Taste of Oregon event at the Governor\u2019s Inaugural Ball held in January at the Oregon Convention Center. To shed light on this reality, and help consumers access the local products they crave, OCVA created a video series highlighting the best of the local seafood and aquaculture industry. Its online content helps citizens and legislators understand the dangers of the current situation and the immediate benefits to people and planet that come with shorter supply chains, such as food security and decreased carbon footprint. \u201cOregon boasts some of the most ecologically sustainable fisheries in the world. But true sustainability also needs to balance economics and equity,\u201d Anderson explains. \u201cWhen we are not feeding our communities, is that sustainable? That\u2019s what this work is about.\u201d COVID-19 caused the preventable collapse of the coastal seafood industry, and OCVA wants to ensure that whatever crisis hits next, whether an earthquake or a geopolitical disaster, this never happens again. Through House Bill 2909, which will largely support installation of the needed hyperlocal infrastructure and GIS prospectors, the team would gain funding to continue increasing the availability of Oregon seafood and aquaculture products for both visitors and residents, and strength the capacity of its food system partners. To make its vision a reality, OCVA seeks more allies\u2014funders, policymakers, private investors, elected officials, businesses and stakeholders\u2014ready to learn more and establish partnership.
