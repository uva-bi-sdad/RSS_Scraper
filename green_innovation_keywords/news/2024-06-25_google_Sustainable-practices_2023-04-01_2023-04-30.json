A circular economy is an economic model that emphasises the efficient use and reuse of resources, products and materials in order to minimise waste and pollution. By prioritising circular economies, brands are able to capitalise on economic benefits, while also meeting the ever-rising demand for sustainable strategists from consumers. That\u2019s why, we\u2019ve rounded up our top 10 brands embracing the circular economy in 2023. Patagonia has been at the forefront of the circular economy movement since first making a sustainability commitment in 1986. The apparel brand aims to reduce its environmental impact through a number of different initiatives, including The Worn Wear programme, which encourages customers to repair, reuse, and recycle their garments. The programme offers a repair service that addresses any damages to the clothing, as well as a trade-in option where customers are provided with store credits for used Patagonia clothing. Through this initiative, Patagonia has successfully prolonged the lifespan of its products while also minimising waste. The brand also introduced a line of clothing that incorporates recycled materials and uses organic cotton and other sustainable fibres. By adopting sustainable materials, Patagonia is making strides to reduce the environmental impact of its products and promote a circular economy.","filter_flag":1}

The 2023 Buying Green Report, released in conjunction with Earth Day (April 22), shows that despite consumer prices rising substantially because of global inflation, consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for products in sustainable packaging. Specifically, 82% of respondents overall would be willing to pay more for sustainable packaging, up four points from 2022, and up eight points since 2021, signaling that even with a worsening economic situation, the environment remains a consumer priority. Younger consumers (ages 18-24) are even more willing, leading at 90%. Consumers now consider the impact their purchases have on the environment, and the majority already have incorporated sustainable practices in their daily lives. Two-thirds of consumers consider themselves environmentally aware. Up six points from last year\u2019s survey, 63% of consumers are now less likely to buy products with packaging that is harmful to the environment. And their intentions are reflected in their actions: 71% already engage in reusable and refillable activities (and 80% are interested in buying refillable packaging products to reduce their environmental impact), while over half engage in reducing food and packaging waste. Narrowing in on sustainable packaging specifically, 71% of consumers are actively choosing products due to the sustainability factor of the product packaging. Interest in purchasing products in sustainable packaging has increased since 2022, especially among younger consumers and high earners. But while 59% look for information on the label about recycling and sustainability, 46% say the biggest barrier to purchase was unclear labeling on packaging. \u201cThere\u2019s a major opportunity here to improve consumer understanding of sustainability claims,\u201d said Jenny Wassenaar, Chief Sustainability Officer, at Trivium Packaging. \u201cThe data in this year\u2019s Buying Green Report shows that consumers are seeking out more information than ever before to improve their understanding of eco-friendly packaging. Trivium\u2019s imperative is to not only incorporate sustainability at every level of our business but to educate consumers on what they\u2019re buying and the impact of their purchase.\u201d \u201cThe data in this year\u2019s Buying Green Report presents a strong case that transitioning to sustainable packaging is not only the right decision for the environment but also the right decision for the business,\u201d said Trivium Packaging CEO Michael Mapes. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that consumers are paving the way for a sustainable future, and businesses need to listen \u2013 external factors like the economy don\u2019t phase the eco-conscious demand. Buyers are looking at the big picture: the survival of our planet. Consumers are turning away from harmful packaging and turning towards sustainable, recyclable options like metal packaging.\u201d The 2023 Buying Green Report is based on a survey of more than 9,000 consumers across Europe, North America and South America exploring participants\u2019 values and behaviors related to sustainable packaging amid a changing world. The fourth annual report provides insight into consumer trends globally, and by age, income, and region.

Real estate professionals who understand sustainable design philosophies become trusted sources that their clients can rely on past the transaction. The word \"sustainable\" is an all-encompassing idea that breaks down into many parts. It could refer to anything from a product made with environmentally-friendly materials to a lifestyle that minimizes one\u2019s carbon footprint. Within the overarching sustainability movement are specific philosophies that seek to solve the various issues facing the environment today. Circular design is one such specific philosophy that focuses on creating d\u00e9cor, fixtures and spaces with extended life cycles, thus reducing waste. \"In contrast to linear design, in which a material is designed, built, used, and discarded, circular design seeks to extend the lifetime of a material by ensuring multiple uses ...\" explains Mackenzie Collier, interior designer and founder of Mackenzie Collier Interiors in Phoenix, Ariz. \"In circular design,\" she adds, \"a product is designed to simplify future reuse or recycling.\" Circular Design 101 First things first: Circular design is not an aesthetic style. Unlike biophilic design or Art Deco, this refers to the philosophy and intention behind a product or space. \"In a circular model, materials and products enjoy endless, closed-loop lifecycles as they ... are reused, recycled, upcycled and transformed into new products and materials,\" says Laurence Carr, interior architect and designer, founder, and CEO of Laurence Carr, Inc. in New York, N.Y. In other words, waste is designed out of the equation. One example of circular design are bathroom tiles made from recycled materials, which are designed to be recycled again. The Difference Between Circular Design and Sustainable Design Circular design and sustainable design go hand in hand. Carr and Collier describe the first as a type or extension of the second. \"Sustainable design is mainly focused on reducing harm,\" explains Carr. \"Circular design is about reducing harm and reversing it to create a positive impact.\" Another way to think about it: Sustainable design minimizes the environmental impact of making a product in the first place. Circular design considers both the present and future sustainability of the materials. For Collier, incorporating circular design into the home is a natural part of a sustainable lifestyle. Homeowners who care about minimizing environmental impact will also feel drawn to circular design. How Homeowners Can Incorporate Circular Design Both design experts prefer not to call circular design a \"trend.\" Collier says it's just a good, environmentally aware practice \u2014 and it's not going away anytime soon. Depending on the client and project, circular design might look like a combination of several of the following: Going vintage. \"This way, our clients get something different than what everyone else is picking up at West Elm or Crate and Barrel this season,\" Collier says. \"It creates a gathered-over-time aesthetic, is often more cost-conscious, AND is the more environmentally sustainable choice.\" \"This way, our clients get something different than what everyone else is picking up at West Elm or Crate and Barrel this season,\" Collier says. \"It creates a gathered-over-time aesthetic, is often more cost-conscious, AND is the more environmentally sustainable choice.\" Prioritizing recycled and recyclable products. In circular design, it's essential to do everything possible to eliminate waste. One way to do that? Recycling. Collier suggests buying from companies with recycling programs (like FLOR recyclable carpet tiles) or products made from recycled materials.

Collier suggests buying from companies with recycling programs (like FLOR recyclable carpet tiles) or products made from recycled materials. Getting pickier about building materials. For Carr, that means using certified and reclaimed woods for flooring. It also looks like using sustainable materials such as bamboo, cork or biomaterial derived from waste.

Sourcing \"forever\" pieces. This could mean quality pieces from local artists or timeless furniture styles that are made to last. Today's circularity-minded clients are turning away from flashy trends and toward homes and products that are made to stand the test of time. This could mean quality pieces from local artists or timeless furniture styles that are made to last. Today's circularity-minded clients are turning away from flashy trends and toward homes and products that are made to stand the test of time. Reimagining the home structure itself. Homeowner clients will probably have an easier time using circular designs during room refreshes or renovations. But for those looking to build, Carr points to prefabricated homes. \"[They're] created with a focus on energy efficiency and durability, able to be disassembled and repurposed at the end of their useful life,\" she says. Circular Design Resources for Clients Infusing a house with circular design takes time. It happens product by product, room by room. So, where should you and your clients start? Third-party certifications, says Carr. That means looking for products and materials verified as sustainable or circular. Here are some of the third-party stamps of approval Carr looks for: \"The built environment generates nearly 50% of annual global CO2 emissions \u2026,\" says Carr. \"Any small efforts we can each make in our own lives add up in a big way, so please do keep circularity at the top of mind whenever making decisions about your home and lifestyle!\"","filter_flag":1}

(Nasdaq: HSIC) today announced the launch of Practice Green \u2013 a global initiative designed to encourage health care practitioners to become more eco-friendly \u2013 in the U.S. and Canada. Practice Green aims to help empower the health care community to establish sustainable practices for a healthier planet. Since 2008, Henry Schein has encouraged its customers to purchase environmentally friendlier products through the U.S. Global Reflections\u00ae Program, which has since evolved into Practice Green\u2122, launched in the EMEA region and Australia earlier this year. Through the new program, eco-friendly services, solutions, and support will be available to help dental and medical customers in the U.S. and Canada implement practical ways to become more sustainable while following current health and safety guidelines and providing high-quality care. The program\u2019s offerings will continue to expand over time, with new products, services, and solutions added as Practice Green develops to meet the ever-changing health care landscape. \u201cAt Henry Schein, environmental stewardship is a pillar of our corporate citizenship, reflecting a sustainable approach to conducting business and offering solutions to our customers,\u201d said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein. \u201cPractice Green reinforces our values, and we are pleased to launch this initiative in observance of Earth Day, echoing our belief that we must together invest in our planet. Henry Schein has a unique opportunity to engage our customers in this work, and it is through our collective responsibility that we can help to quicken the transition to an equitable and prosperous green economy for all.\u201d The Practice Green portfolio includes a curated collection of dental products selected by Henry Schein as \u2018green\u2019 based on supplier partner product information. These \u2018green\u2019 products fall into at least one of the following categories: reusable, contain recycled materials, can be recycled, are biodegradable, or are from a sustainable source. Medical products presently are being reviewed for inclusion as part of the portfolio. Click here for a video about the program\u2019s mission. In addition to the launch of Practice Green, Henry Schein is celebrating Earth Day by implementing carbon neutral shipping in its U.S. network during the month of April. This aligns with the Company\u2019s commitment to mitigate its impact on the climate, reduce landfill waste, and recycle and reuse valuable materials while practicing smart and efficient use of energy and water resources. Henry Schein is continuously strengthening its approach to measuring, monitoring, and reporting on its carbon emissions and other environmental impacts. For example, in 2021, Henry Schein signed the Business Ambition for 1.5\u2070C Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), committing to set a long-term, science-based emissions reduction target in order to reach net-zero global emissions by 2050. Additionally, to guide the Company's efforts and education related to environmental sustainability, Henry Schein established an Environmental Impact Council in 2022, which is made up of a global cross-functional group of senior leaders, with Kurt Kuehn, member of Henry Schein\u2019s Board of Directors and the Standards Board of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and former Chief Financial Officer at United Parcel Service, Inc., as an advisor.

Through Christine\u2019s lead\u00ader\u00adship, Maud Borup con\u00adtin\u00adues to intro\u00adduce new and indul\u00adgent prod\u00aducts, while ensur\u00ading that sus\u00adtain\u00adable prac\u00adtices are con\u00adsid\u00adered every step of the way. Candy Industry Senior Editor Liz Parker was able to talk to Lantinen about the company's sustainability practices, as well as the steps it took to become B Corp certified. Liz Parker: How is Maud Borup handling sustainability at its plant? Christine Lantinen: Maud Borup became a certified B Corp this past year, balancing people and purpose with profits. We are one of only about 5,000 companies in the world to hold this certification. We have a zero-landfill waste initiative at all three of our manufacturing facilities. This means that everything is either reused or recycled. To do this, we must understand post-industrial waste options for recycling within each community. It is important that bins are properly labeled within each facility so that everyone knows where to put things. There is an ongoing need to educate employees on where things go so that we are properly recycling and reusing whenever possible. LP: Can you talk about how the company received its Certified B Corp status? CL: Karen Edwards [a Maud Borup spokesperson] managed our internal process of becoming B Corp certified. This is a robust and inclusive certification that examines all areas of the company. It forces you to dig deep into all aspects of your company, track environmental trends, and document policies regarding sustainability, people, and purpose to ensure you remain on point with social and environmental goals. There are five modules involved in the audit: Governance, Workers, Customers, Community, Environment. Your answers either gain or lose points and then lead you to another set of questions. Once you pass each module, you then move onto the next. It took us about two years to become certified and we are pleased with the groundwork that this audit laid to ensure that we remain purpose and people driven. LP: What about the company's wind turbine? CL: We installed a wind turbine in 2017 and are continually working to maximize its efficiency. The turbine can produce 100 kilowatts of energy per hour, so it has the capacity to power a large portion of our Le Center manufacturing facility. In addition, any excess energy produced can be sold to the city. We are also currently looking into installing solar panels on our largest manufacturing facility in Le Center to provide additional renewable energy. LP: How did Maud Borup become SQF certified? CL: SQF stands for Safe Quality Food. It is a food safety and quality program that is recognized by retailers, brand owners, and food service providers worldwide. Nadya Messer manages our audit certifications internally at all three of our manufacturing facilities. When we first became SQF certified in 2014 my mom, Pam Cooney, was leading our SQF audits. She still works within the company on hardline audits and was instrumental in writing policies and implementing training programs in advance of our first SQF audit. My mom attended SQF auditor training to understand the needs of this certification and to best help our co-manufacturers in preparing for the audit. LP: Christine, you testified in front of Congress on supply chain channels and sustainability. How did that invitation from Congress come about? CL: Christine and her husband, Randy, attended a round table event hosted by Congressman Dean Phillips, D-MN, and Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne, R-TX, to discuss small business supply chain and trade challenges during the height of the pandemic. At this roundtable, Christine told the group that the cost of a container shipping from the same China port to a U.S. destination on the same date one year later had increased 500%. Following this event, she was asked to testify in front of Congress on small business trade challenges. She spoke about being unable to fill over 100 open positions, and that her business was up over 70% YOY (year-over-year). She suggested solutions on how the government could incentivize retirees to come back to work in the short term to help. About 17% of the American population are retirees, which are not considered a part of the work force, as they are neither employed nor looking for employment, yet many still have the ability and drive to work but are concerned about the impact on their retirement income. LP: What\u2019s new for the brand in 2023 in terms of new initiatives? CL: We put a heightened focus on purchasing recycled content for packaging prior to the pandemic but had a difficult time continuing this initiative throughout the pandemic due to work force shortages and SKU limitations. Now that the economy is restabilizing, we are back to this being a focus for 2023 and beyond. We are constantly looking at how we can reduce our footprint both on shelf and in transit to stores. We work hard to ensure that everything we purchase is recyclable, and as a next step are looking to source materials made from a percentage of recycled content. It can be more challenging with food packaging to ensure products are food safe when there is recycled content. Streams can be mixed during the recycling process, making it more difficult to ensure food contact safety. We seek post-industrial waste (waste generated during the manufacturing process), vs post-consumer waste, to ensure that streams remain virgin for these purposes.","filter_flag":1}

But can farmers really deliver on this groundbreaking deal? As global temperatures continue to rise, it\u2019s essential that all sectors do their part in achieving sustainability goals. Farmers have a unique opportunity to drive meaningful change \u2013 but only if they are given the tools they need to meet the challenge head-on. In this article, we explore what it will take for farmers to become part of the green transformation that\u2019s needed at an unprecedented scale if Europe is to reach its net zero emissions target by 2050. We\u2019ll look at what new technologies, strategies and incentives might be required for them to succeed in meeting these demands. EU Green Deal is a groundbreaking initiative to transform the way we interact with our environment The deal aims to decarbonise the economy while also creating jobs, improving health outcomes and protecting nature at the same time. To accomplish these goals, it advances legislation regarding renewable energy sources, sustainable transport systems and green building standards. In addition, it supports research into new technologies, such as carbon capture storage or green hydrogen production, which can help mitigate some of our current environmental issues. To ensure success, everyone must work together \u2013 governments, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens alike. Farmers are particularly important players in making progress towards meeting the EU\u2019s sustainability goals. As they own much of Europe\u2019s agricultural land, their actions will have far-reaching implications for how we use resources today and in the future. This includes reducing harmful inputs like fertilisers and pesticides; conserving water through improved irrigation practices; rotating crops more often; increasing organic matter content in soils; restoring wetlands; planting trees; managing livestock responsibly; encouraging pasture biodiversity, and more. Overview of the EU Green Deal environmental commitments The EU\u2019s Green Deal brings with it a range of environmental commitments and goals, including: the promotion of sustainable agriculture; green infrastructure; circular economy; environmental conservation; and organic farming practices. Sustainable agriculture is about reducing agricultural emissions while still producing enough food to meet human needs. This can be achieved through improved agroecological systems that are more resilient to climate change and use fewer resources. Regarding green infrastructure, the EU wants to promote natural habitats such as wetlands and forests, which help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Furthermore, they aim to increase biodiversity by protecting endangered species and promoting wildlife corridors between protected areas. Circular economies are designed to reduce waste production by reusing or recycling materials into new products. The EU has committed to phasing out single-use plastic items and encouraging businesses to invest in greener technologies for manufacturing processes. Finally, environmental conservation efforts focus on preserving natural ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and other bodies of water from pollution caused by heavy industry and urban runoff. Organic farming also plays an important role here since it reduces pesticide usage compared to traditional agriculture methods. Farmers must implement land-use change strategies To meet the environmental commitments of the EU Green Deal, farmers must implement land-use change strategies. These strategies involve a combination of conservation practices that aim to reduce negative environmental impacts and improve sustainability. Establishing agroforestry systems \u2013 Agroforestry is an integrated approach which combines trees with crops or livestock in a mutually beneficial way. This helps create a more diverse, productive and resilient agricultural system. Prioritising green infrastructure \u2013 this involves creating habitats for native species, such as hedgerows and wildflower meadows, which can help increase biodiversity and provide additional sources of food for pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and moths. Promoting crop rotation \u2013 Crop rotation is one of the oldest farming techniques known to man; it involves growing different types of crops in succession over time which can lead to improved soil fertility and pest control while reducing reliance on chemical inputs. Encouraging organic production \u2013 Organic agriculture is a holistic approach which focuses on maintaining healthy soils through reduced tillage, composting and other natural methods without using synthetic fertilisers or pesticides. It also encourages greater diversity regarding plant varieties grown and animal breeds reared, thus increasing long-term resilience against climate change impacts. Soil management techniques Soil is a vital component of the environment, and soil management techniques can ensure farmers deliver on their environmental commitments. One such technique is improving soil fertility. This involves using organic matter, mulch or compost to add nutrients back into the soil that has been depleted due to intensive farming practices. Additionally, it also helps with increasing water retention, which can help protect crops from drought conditions. Another important technique for managing soils is through health management strategies. These involve methods such as crop rotation, cover cropping or intercropping to reduce pest pressures and improve nutrient cycling within the farm system. Healthier soils are better able to retain moisture and provide more beneficial microbial activity, which can further support agricultural productivity. Carbon sequestration is another key area where farmers need to focus when delivering on their environmental commitments. Through various measures such as no-tillage systems or growing legumes, farmers can increase the amount of carbon stored in their soils by reducing erosion and encouraging healthy root growth belowground. In addition, these methods also help reduce fertiliser runoff which can have damaging impacts on nearby ecosystems. Finally, preventing soil erosion should be a priority for all farmers. By implementing conservation agriculture principles such as minimum tillage operations or planting strips of grass between fields, they can maintain surface vegetation that slows down rainwater runoff and prevents topsoil loss while providing additional habitats for wildlife species like pollinators. All these approaches should be taken together with regular monitoring so that any changes over time can be tracked and dealt with accordingly. Agriculture water conservation practices Water conservation strategies are vital for preserving precious resources, as well as protecting aquatic ecosystems from damage caused by pollution or overuse. Farmers can implement water conservation practices, techniques and methods on their land. The most basic practice farmers should adopt is efficient irrigation systems which ensure that crops receive only the amount of water necessary for optimal growth. Additionally, crop rotation will reduce the need for excessive watering due to differences in soil composition between different types of crops. Covering soils with mulch also helps retain moisture and reduces evaporation from the sun\u2019s rays. By taking these steps, farmers can significantly reduce their water usage while ensuring healthy yields and profits. Furthermore, there are several other water conservation programs available to assist farmers in reducing their water footprint even further. For example, some local governments may provide incentives such as grants or tax credits to encourage implementing environmentally friendly practices like using rain barrels or drip irrigation systems. There are also many private organisations working with farmers to develop innovative solutions, such as developing low-cost filtration systems that can capture clean rainwater runoff for use during dry spells. Agricultural biodiversity protection measures Biodiversity protection measures involve protecting plant species, restoring wildlife habitats, undertaking ecosystem restoration projects, and introducing new species into an area through reintroduction programs. These activities all have a positive effect on global ecosystems and provide benefits such as improved air quality, greater water retention in soils, increased carbon sequestration, increased food production, and better disease control. Protecting plant species is essential for maintaining healthy ecological systems; by conserving native plants, we create habitats that support wildlife populations which then promote stability within local environments. Wildlife habitat restoration involves creating more suitable conditions to allow endangered or threatened species to live in their natural environment with adequate resources. Ecosystems restoration projects aim to restore degraded land areas by removing invasive species while planting native vegetation and establishing sustainable practices like agroforestry or integrated farming techniques. Finally, reintroducing extinct or locally rare animal and plant species helps maintain genetic diversity in an area which can lead to the long-term sustainability of whole ecosystems. Climate change mitigation approaches in farming As part of the Green Deal agenda, farmers must implement measures to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting to its effects through resilient agricultural practices. Carbon storage is an important tool in mitigating climate change, as it captures and stores carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration can be achieved through various approaches, including no-till farming, agroforestry, cover crops, organic matter management, and rotational grazing systems. These strategies not only reduce CO2 levels but also help improve soil health and productivity for farmers who use them. Climate adaptation measures are equally essential in tackling the impact of global warming. Sustainable agriculture techniques such as improved irrigation methods, pest control strategies that minimise chemical inputs, and diversified crop rotation cycles have been shown to increase farms\u2019 resilience against extreme weather events caused by climate change. Additionally, investments in technologies like precision agriculture provide farmers with valuable information about their land to better manage water resources and adapt quickly when conditions vary from year to year. Finally, sustainable intensification offers another approach to balancing food production goals with environmental protection objectives in Europe\u2019s changing landscape. Farmers can maximise yields while minimising negative impacts on biodiversity through best management practices such as integrated pest management and nutrient management plans designed for specific soils and sites. These conservation tillage systems cover ground throughout the growing season and enhance biological controls that utilise natural predators instead of chemicals to combat pests or weeds. Renewable energy production guidelines for farmers Farmers must also ensure they adhere to guidelines for producing renewable energy in a sustainable manner. Renewable energy production requires careful planning and monitoring; however, the rewards are well worth the effort. The main benefit is that it does not rely on finite resources such as fossil fuels like coal or oil; instead, it relies on limitless sources such as solar power, wind power, geothermal heat pumps and hydroelectricity. This makes it more cost-effective and reliable than traditional forms of energy production. Additionally, renewable energy has zero emissions which help reduce global warming by preventing pollution from entering the atmosphere. To achieve these goals, countries within the European Union must develop specific standards related to renewable energy production. These standards should provide regulations surrounding how much electricity needs to be generated with renewables each year, what types of technology can be used (i.e., photovoltaic systems), how often maintenance needs to occur and when new installations need to occur for targets to be met efficiently. Furthermore, consideration should also be given toward incentivising farmers who choose alternative methods of generating electricity from their land \u2013 this could include subsidies for those investing in solar panels or grants for developing innovative technologies such as biomass boilers or small-scale hydropower plants. Carbon sequestration protocols in agriculture Carbon sequestration in agriculture helps to capture and store carbon dioxide in soils, vegetation, and other geological formations. In this way, it serves as a tool to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations by trapping or sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. One method of soil sequestration used by farmers is no-till farming practices. These involve leaving crop residues on fields after harvest rather than ploughing them back into the soil. By doing so, more organic matter can break down over time which increases soil fertility and captures additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other strategies may include planting cover crops that help to maintain moisture levels in soils and increase natural nutrient cycling processes. Agricultural land management systems also play an important role in capturing atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis and storage in plant materials such as roots and leaves. For example, incorporating trees onto croplands provides shade which decreases evapotranspiration rates while simultaneously increasing biomass accumulation for long-term soil improvement purposes. Moreover, the use of nitrogen fertilisers should be reduced where possible because they emit nitrous oxide \u2013 a powerful greenhouse gas \u2013 during their application onto fields. Farming resource efficiency standards Resource efficiency involves optimising multiple aspects of farming practices and processes \u2013 such as energy efficiency, sustainable production methods, water conservation, land management and waste reduction. Standards Compliance requirements Benefits Energy efficiency practices Use renewable sources for power generation; reduce consumption of non-renewable resources; implement efficient equipment in production activities. Helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increases cost savings, and improves operational performance. Sustainable farming practices Reduce the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides; pursue organic agriculture techniques when feasible; promote biodiversity by planting native species. Improves soil health and fertility; protects ecosystems from pollution; preserve natural habitats for wildlife. Water conservation standards Minimise water usage throughout operations; install rainwater harvesting systems on farms whenever possible. Enhances water supply availability for future generations; reduces strain on local watersheds and groundwater reserves. Taking these measures can help producers comply with current environmental regulations while also allowing them to benefit from cost savings associated with improved efficiency and reduced waste disposal costs. Additionally, implementing resource efficiency standards has numerous long-term benefits that extend beyond compliance requirements \u2013 including greater sustainability in agricultural production methods, which leads to healthier soils, cleaner air and water, increased biodiversity levels, better crop yields, fewer pests and disease outbreaks, higher quality food products and enhanced animal welfare conditions in livestock husbandry systems. Waste reduction protocols for farmers Farmers must take proactive steps toward implementing sound waste management practices that will significantly reduce waste production and landfill contribution, as well as lower greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly, farmers should assess their current state of operations regarding waste production and disposal methods. This assessment can be used to identify areas where further efforts could result in improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. For example, farmers may need to invest more resources into preventing soil degradation or replacing certain chemicals with safer alternatives. Next, farmers must develop comprehensive plans outlining how they intend to reduce their own wastage while also promoting sustainable practices among other stakeholders such as suppliers and customers. These plans should include measures such as transitioning away from single-use plastics or reducing packaging materials when possible. It would also help if these plans included incentives for others who use the farmer\u2019s products or services so that everyone benefits from adopting greener habits. Finally, it is important for farmers to monitor their progress on an ongoing basis through regular audits and assessments. Doing so will allow them to track how much waste has been effectively reduced over time, allowing them to make adjustments accordingly if needed. Pollution control regulations for farmers Pollution control regulations are essential for farmers to ensure that their operations do not cause excessive air or water pollution. Air and water pollution can have serious consequences both in terms of human health and the environment, so it is important that farms comply with applicable laws and regulations. When it comes to air pollution control, several different regulations apply depending on where the farm is located. For example, some countries may require farms to use certain types of equipment or technologies to reduce emissions from agricultural activities such as animal husbandry or crop production. Similarly, there may be restrictions on burning wood or other materials which could release pollutants into the atmosphere. In some cases, farmers may need to obtain permits before carrying out any activity which has the potential to produce air pollutants. Water pollution control also requires adherence to specific regulations. The type of regulation depends largely on local conditions but typically involves measures designed to prevent contamination of surface waters by fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals used in farming operations; limits on the number of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into rivers and lakes; prevention of erosion caused by overgrazing; and maintenance of riparian zones along waterways. Farmers should take steps to minimise runoff from fields which contain agrichemicals, particularly when these enter sensitive aquatic habitats such as wetlands or coral reefs. Finally, understanding how these various regulations interact with one another is critical. To this end, farm owners should regularly consult with experts who can advise them regarding their particular situation and help them develop strategies for managing their operations sustainably while meeting all legal requirements related to air and water pollution control. Agrotech innovations for farmers Smart irrigation has already proven effective in reducing water usage while still maximising crop yield. By using sensors to determine the exact amount of water needed at any given time, farmers can target their watering efforts more accurately than ever before. This technology also allows farmers to monitor soil moisture levels remotely, helping them reduce labour costs associated with manual monitoring and ensuring they use no more water than necessary. Agrotech solutions such as drones and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionised agricultural production processes by providing accurate data about crops without having to visit each field daily physically. AI-driven analytics platforms allow users to assess conditions such as soil fertility or pest infestations much faster than traditional methods, allowing decisions to be made quickly based on current facts rather than guesswork. Moreover, autonomous farm machines are now capable of performing a variety of tasks like planting seeds or harvesting crops without human intervention \u2013 saving cost, energy and manpower significantly. Finally, agroecology systems provide an invaluable way for farmers to implement sustainable practices into their operations without compromising yields or economic viability. These systems focus on integrating natural resources carefully into production cycles so that crops benefit from natural processes instead of relying solely on chemical inputs. Not only does this reduce reliance on external inputs like fertilisers and pesticides, but it also encourages healthier soils which leads to higher quality produce over longer periods of time \u2013 all achievable through careful management of nature\u2019s own resources. What financial support and incentives are available to farmers? The EU is offering financial support and incentives for farmers, including green deal funding as well as rural development programs and agricultural subsidies. Green Deal funding is designed to provide resources to farmers who are dedicated to making their operations more sustainable and eco-friendly. It covers projects such as organic farming, agroforestry, building energy-efficient structures, developing renewable energy sources, and reducing water pollution. It can also be used for research into new technologies or techniques that increase efficiency in production while ensuring sustainability standards are met. Rural development programs seek to improve economic activity in rural parts of Europe by providing grants and loans to businesses and individuals. These funds can go towards improving infrastructure related to agriculture, forestry management, food processing facilities, marketing campaigns and other activities that promote job creation and economic growth in these areas. Farmers may qualify for special financing opportunities geared towards modernising farm equipment or expanding production with an eye toward sustainability goals set forth by the EU Green Deal. Finally, the EU provides agricultural subsidies which cover a range of expenses associated with running a farm business, such as fertiliser costs, seed purchases, labour wages and veterinary care for animals kept on the property. Subsidies help ensure that small farms remain viable even when market prices drop below what would otherwise allow them to stay profitable. They also give farmers additional security when investing in initiatives mandated by the green deal since they know there will be some form of compensation if their efforts fail to yield desired results over time. Enforcement and monitoring mechanisms for the EU Green Deal environmental commitments To ensure that environmental commitments are met, enforcement and monitoring mechanisms must be implemented as part of the overall policy package. Enforcement measures involve setting up systems for compliance and penalties for non-compliance. This could include establishing reporting requirements and oversight processes or introducing fines for non-adherence. Monitoring mechanisms such as satellite imagery can help track progress towards achieving environmental objectives while also providing data to enforce regulatory regimes. To be able to monitor and enforce compliance with EU green policies effectively, the following key elements should form part of the process: Establishing clear metrics against which performance can be measured; Developing effective communication channels between stakeholders; Introducing incentives for good environmental behaviour; Ensuring adequate resources are available for monitoring efforts. When these elements come together, it creates an environment where farmers can have confidence that their actions will be monitored and enforced accordingly. By having reliable feedback loops in place, farmers can take ownership of their own sustainability journey, knowing how their decisions affect both society and the environment. Moreover, this helps create accountability across all actors involved in making sure sustainable practices become mainstream within Europe\u2019s agricultural sector. What are the implications of the EU Green Deal for farmers in other countries? The international implications of the EU Green Deal are wide-reaching. With its potential to bring about positive environmental change, it\u2019s no wonder that farmers in other countries have begun to take notice. But what exactly does the deal mean for them? What implications arise from adopting the green policies enshrined within it? Firstly, there is a clear benefit regarding sustainability and eco-friendly practices. Farmers who sign up for the EU Green Deal will be expected to adhere to certain environmental standards; these may include reducing their use of pesticides or limiting water consumption on their farms. By taking part in this initiative, they can improve their farm\u2019s efficiency while also helping protect the environment. This could potentially lead to increased profits as well as improved public opinion about agricultural practices worldwide. Secondly, participating in the EU Green Deal could open new markets for farmers outside Europe. As more countries adopt environmentally friendly farming methods and regulations, businesses outside the European Union may be better equipped to meet customer demands abroad. Additionally, those involved in foreign trade may see greater opportunities if they can demonstrate compliance with global standards set by organisations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Thirdly, farmers should consider how they can collaborate with each other and share resources when implementing green initiatives outlined by the EU Green Deal. International cooperation between different nations\u2019 agricultural sectors could help reduce costs associated with adapting production processes and technologies needed to comply with green regulations. It would also provide a platform for exchanging knowledge on sustainable farming techniques, which could ultimately benefit all participants involved. Are there any penalties for farmers not complying with the EU Green Deal? The question of penalties for farmers who do not comply with the EU Green Deal is a crucial one. Firstly, fines may be imposed on those farmers who don\u2019t adhere to the rules laid down by the EU Green Deal. These could range from relatively small amounts to much larger sums which must be paid immediately or over time as part of an extended payment plan. Additionally, some countries may choose to implement other forms of punishment, such as restrictions on trading or potential jail sentences for more serious offences. In addition to financial and legal consequences, farmers can also face reputational damage if found guilty of breaking any rules outlined in the EU Green Deal. This could include negative press coverage or public criticism, making it harder for them to continue doing business successfully in their local communities. Reputation management will become increasingly important going forward, so it pays off for farmers to ensure they\u2019re sticking to all necessary regulations. What are the long-term benefits of complying with the EU Green Deal environmental commitments? Like a phoenix from the ashes, complying with the environmental commitments of the EU Green Deal can bring long-term benefits for farmers. First and foremost, farmers who comply with the EU Green Deal will help sustainably manage their land use and production processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This kind of stewardship over natural resources not only helps ensure healthy ecosystems but also serves as an example for other agricultural operations worldwide. As a result, compliant farms could likely see improved customer relations thanks to increased trust stemming from sustainable practices. In addition, adopting environmentally friendly methods could lead to financial incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies provided by governments or organisations like the European Commission. These rewards could provide more leeway when deciding on investments into new technologies or equipment designed to reduce energy consumption or improve efficiency in resource management. By investing wisely now, farmers may be able to reap greater profits down the road. Finally, compliance with the EU Green Deal brings about social responsibility, demonstrating a commitment to protecting nature and safeguarding food security for future generations. Being part of something larger than oneself gives people purpose and pride \u2013 both important elements necessary for any successful business venture. Embracing these values can give farmers access to a wider pool of customers looking for ethically sourced products while simultaneously boosting public confidence in their efforts towards better environmental protection measures.","filter_flag":1}

Even the small wins count! Sustainable living may sound overwhelming if you don\u2019t know where to start, but you don\u2019t have to overhaul your entire life to go green. Every choice we make affects the environment in some way, so you can get the ball rolling with little swaps and positive changes that minimise your impact on the Earth. We asked 21 entrepreneurs in Singapore for advice on green living, and they came through with fantastic sustainability tips you can incorporate into your everyday life. Let\u2019s talk about sustainability in Singapore: Useful eco-friendly tips 1. Swap single-use period products for reusable ones A large amount of non-recyclable plastic is present in traditional sanitary products such as pads and tampons. To live more sustainably, swap out single-use period products for period underwear that\u2019s washable and reusable. You can wear it during WFH days or at night to sleep. Or on those days leading up to your period (because periods like to come when you least expect it and it never feels good walking around with a dry, itchy pad). If you have post-natal bladder leaks and constantly wear a panty liner, period underwear works just as efficiently. And it\u2019s much kinder to the environment. \u2013 Jamie Choon, founder of Mooncheeks Period Underwear 2. Show love to pre-loved and package-free goods My family and I started our low-waste journey in 2018. We purchase pre-loved items instead of new ones wherever possible. I love using Carousell or even Facebook marketplace for items we need like clothing and books. We also go for reusables instead of single-use items. For example, cloth napkins instead of kitchen paper towels, reusable containers to pack leftovers, and a reusable water bottle to curb the need to purchase packaged water. Also, have a meal plan, use leftovers creatively, and buy package-free produce to reduce food waste. We love supporting Unpackt. \u2013 Dr. Aparna Chari Sundar, certified KonMari consultant and Montessori positive parenting coach at Global Mindful Journey 3. Try solid soap bars We\u2019ve been using solid shampoo bars in our family for years now \u2013 they\u2019re easy to use and effective cleaners. My favourite is from the local brand Oasis Beauty Kitchen. We\u2019ve also gone from liquid soaps to solid form \u2013 for foaming hand wash, laundry soap, and household cleaners. Buying the concentrated form of what you need and adding water at home is a no-brainer. I get all these swaps from The Green Collective. We can\u2019t get away without using rubbish bags so we use food bags as rubbish holders as much as possible. The most common in our household is the standard sandwich bag \u2013 they hold a lot of rubbish and come with their own tie to secure the bag before throwing it down the chute! \u2013 Jennifer Gregory, director of Indosole Singapore 4. Ditch those shampoo bottles Did you know one bar of solid shampoo can replace between two to three bottles? That\u2019s because 90% of liquid shampoo is usually water. Solid shampoos only contain active ingredients, proteins, luscious butter and oils, and sometimes botanicals. Of course, they don\u2019t come with plastic bottles, so they don\u2019t generate plastic waste. After you finish it, nothing is left. Solid shampoos are usually free of parabens, sulfates, and silicones. So they offer benefits to the environment and health benefits to your hair. This brought me to study and work on creating my own recipes for handmade solid shampoos with ingredients that not only respect the environment but also my body. \u2013 Susan Calderon Urbina, founder of Sacha Botanicals 5. Reduce paper use and bring bags for grocery shopping Our mantra in this area is \u201cprogress, not perfection\u201d as we make each small step. The key changes we\u2019ve made at our office are: choosing non-centralised air-cons, using non-disposable cups or cutlery made available in the pantry, and reducing our paper use. On a personal level, a reusable water bottle, a coffee cup and a reusable cloth bag in my purse are small shifts in my daily habits that I implemented with ease. Silicon zip locks and cloth bags also come along when I go grocery shopping at the markets! \u2013 Puja Surtani, director of Eastern Scent 6. Go vegetarian, avoid takeaways and take public transportation Carry your own water bottle and bag to reduce your reliance on single-use plastics. Start with one day a week on a vegetarian diet, and gradually increase the frequency. Eating less meat can significantly reduce your carbon footprint and improve your health. Avoid takeaways or carry your own box. Takeaway containers are often made of non-biodegradable materials that harm the environment. Lastly, take public transport, walk or cycle to reduce your carbon footprint and improve your physical health. Cars are a major source of air pollution and contribute to climate change. \u2013 Ankita Jain, founder of Purple & Pure 7. Compost, volunteer and shop second hand Composting is one of the most generous acts we can offer the Earth. It\u2019s essentially about turning waste into soil, and soil is a nourishing fertile life force. Practice composting can be simple \u2013 gather your raw food waste into a container and put it in the freezer. Next, bring it to your local community garden for composting. Learn more with Soil Social. If you\u2019d like to offer a more active role, explore volunteering at a community garden. Habitat Collective and Cultivate Central will help guide you in the basics of gardening, growing food, and its importance in our life. Also, shop second-hand with Loving Loot or try brands like The Fashion Pulpit to refresh your wardrobe in a sustainable way. \u2013 Chloe Calderon Chotrani, somatic therapist at Body as Earth 8. Swap and shop mindfully Leverage your community! Use apps like Olio or Carousell to declutter and get amazing finds. We also leverage condo chats and neighbourhood groups to recycle and donate or even organise swap shops in function rooms. If you have kids\u2019 outgrown or second-hand items, list them with Nimbu. It\u2019s South-East Asia\u2019s first circular brand that provides a full service from pick-up to listing to finding new homes for your kids\u2019 beloved clothes, toys, books and shoes. If you can do without, find creative ways to not shop. But if you shop, use the item to its fullest. As long as you can keep the items away from a landfill, you\u2019re on the path towards sustainable living! Support sustainable local businesses and share about them with friends to magnify their impact. \u2013 Kriti Gupta, founder & CEO of Nimbu 9. Think about why you\u2019re making the change and align it with your values The most important step to making easy eco-conscious changes is to start within. Why are these changes important to you? Long-term change will only happen when you really tap into your values. Be aware of what you wear most and why; how does it make you feel? Is it the fabric, the functionality or the fit? This is your guide for how all your clothes should make you feel. And stop buying for the sake of buying \u2013 that goes for clothes, groceries, beauty products, and so on. Other tips include making meal plans to reduce food waste and buying second-hand furniture. The beauty of sustainability is that it always has benefits for you and the environment. \u2013 Biek Speijk, wardrobe curator and artist 10. Make your own natural floor cleaner I make my own no-nasties floor cleaner from fruit peels \u2013 also known as eco enzymes. This is a multi-purpose liquid that\u2019s produced from the fermentation of organic waste. It can be used as floor or kitchen cleaner, fruit and vegetable cleaner, insect repellent or plant fertiliser. Just take a bottle, add three parts of fruit peel, one part of sugar and 10 parts of water. Let it sit for three months and open the cap of the bottle every day to let out the fermentation gases. After that, strain the liquid and voila! It serves many purposes \u2013 it reduces food waste and the usage of chemical cleaners in your home, and re-uses single-use plastic bottles. \u2013 Sangeeta Nair, founder of The Eco-Statement 11. Small green steps count towards making an impact You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be part of the solution. Find an area you\u2019re passionate about and start there. This journey can be fun and enjoyable. Check out Project Drawdown, which shares nearly 100 solutions that already or almost exist, or Anatomy of Action by the UN, which lists the five major areas that will lead to collective change if each of us makes the change. If you\u2019re looking for quick wins, think about the decision you make on your plate. Adopting more of a flexitarian diet (more plants, less meat) is a great place to start. Check your bank and what it does with your money. Most of us don\u2019t realise that banks invest our money into projects that are harmful to the planet \u2013 but you can tell them not to. If you\u2019re a business owner, do an audit on your website and see how you can reduce the emissions it\u2019s producing. Look at how you can integrate small impactful actions with companies like Handprint. \u2013 Stephanie Dickson, founder of Green Is The New Black and Live Wide Awake 12. Go for reusable, second-hand and energy-efficient items Use plantable stationery, a reusable bag, and get a refillable water bottle and reusable coffee cup. You can also reduce food waste. Plan your meals in advance and only buy the food you need. Try to use leftovers instead of throwing them away. Go for energy-efficient light bulbs as they use less energy and last longer. If possible, get on public transportation instead of driving your car. This will reduce your carbon footprint and can be a more cost-effective option. Instead of buying new items, consider purchasing second-hand. It\u2019ll reduce the demand for new products and save money. \u2013 Radhika Mayani, founder of Left-handesign 13. Support eco-conscious, ethical and local businesses To reduce my environmental impact, I opt for reusable products over disposable ones: cloth bags for groceries, refillable water bottles, and cloth towels instead of paper towels. I also conserve resources and reduce my carbon footprint by saving energy whenever possible. This includes turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using energy-efficient appliances. I believe in supporting eco-friendly and ethical brands \u2013 like local small businesses and farmers \u2013 that prioritise sustainability and social responsibility. Plus, I use public transportation or walk whenever possible. Education and advocacy are essential components of sustainable living. By sharing my sustainable practices with my family and friends, I can inspire them to make similar changes in their own lives. \u2013 Michelle Chan, founder and certified natural skincare formulator at Miseico 14. Living a sustainable life can be fun! There\u2019s a misconception that living sustainably requires sacrificing comfort. Instead, see it as an opportunity to discover new experiences while contributing to a healthier planet. Rethink your purchasing habits. Be mindful of the brands you support. Choose responsible labels that prioritise eco-friendly materials, reduce waste, and ensure ethical labour practices. Consider buying used items. If you\u2019re buying a gift, think outside the box. Adopting trees for friends and family is memorable and rewilds the planet. Spice up your meal routine with plant-based options. Meat production is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Even if you can\u2019t commit to a vegan diet, go meat-free one day a week. My go-to app is aBillion, where you\u2019ll find thousands of restaurants with meat-free options. Take it from a former steak-loving French turned vegan: plant-based food is incredible! \u2013 Laure Guilbaud, co-founder and COO at Teorra, and founder and managing director at Kynd 15. Start simple with easy food swaps One quick way is to focus on everyday things we already do, like eating. Switch around what you eat, like going for noodles made from upcycled materials, rather than raw materials. You probably didn\u2019t know that spent barley grains, which are used to make beers, can actually be used to make better food! One example I love in the market is W0W Noodles. Sometimes, our aversion towards eating \u201cwaste by-products\u201d is a self-limiting belief. Before we say no to making a habit change, perhaps take some time to say, why not? \u2013 John Lim, founder of Live Young and Well 16. Choose solids instead of liquids in plastic containers I\u2019ve been gradually transitioning to solid personal care and home care products. They\u2019re compacted and concentrated, eliminating the need for large plastic containers and reducing emissions from transportation. In Singapore, there are many brands that offer solid soaps and shampoos, as well as laundry detergent sheets and cleaning capsules with natural, good quality ingredients. These products are eco-friendly, easy to use and space-saving. \u2013 Vrinda Jain, founder of Altereco 17. Opt for your bike over your car Biking has always been a part of my life, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that I truly realised its impact on the environment and my own mental health. As I pedal through the streets, I feel like I\u2019m doing my part to reduce my carbon footprint and protect the environment for future generations. Biking is a great way to clear my mind and reduce stress. It gives me a sense of freedom and independence, and the endorphins released make me feel happier and more energised throughout the day. \u2013 Dana Wolf, feng shui expert, certified KonMari consultant, and founder of Anjia Living 18. Make sustainability a part of what you love One of the first hacks I implemented when I embarked on my sustainability journey a few years ago was to start small. This means taking the first green step that makes sense to you \u2013 and repeating that over time. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, you can implement other baby steps that will eventually have a great impact on your life. Secondly, join a community of people that have a sustainability mindset. By meeting online or at events, you\u2019ll have a sense of belonging that\u2019ll help you keep up the good fight! Finally, embrace a test-and-learn mindset. Do the things that you love, that bring you energy. For some, this can mean gardening or composting; for others, it can be picking up trash on the beach or cooking vegan meals. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution; it\u2019s about doing the things that make sense to you. \u2013 Alya Annabi, founder of GreenPush and a sustainability change agent 19. Use eco-friendly kitchen sponges Did you know regular coloured sponges are made from petroleum-based ingredients that can leach microplastics into our waterways, harming our planet and wildlife? Eco-friendly alternatives like cellulose sponges are just as effective. Made from wood pulp processed into cellulose, they\u2019re topped with a natural luffa scrubber and sewn together with cotton twine. While eco-sponges may not last longer than your regular coloured sponge, they\u2019re 100% biodegradable and compostable. They also contain no harmful ingredients. Tip: cut the corner off a sponge that has done its time in the kitchen, so you can use it for grubbier tasks such as outdoor and heavier-duty cleaning \u2013 and make the most out of it before proper disposal. \u2013 Caroline Warren, owner of NaturalSpot 20. Remember: living sustainably doesn\u2019t have to be difficult or expensive Avoid using single-use plastics such as straws, utensils, and food containers. Try having a meat-free day once a week, or swap meat for plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, and tofu. You can also plan your meals, shop with a list, and store food properly to reduce food waste. Use leftovers in creative ways and compost food scraps. Turn off lights, unplug electronics, and adjust your thermostat to save energy. Use natural light whenever possible and hang your clothes to dry instead of using a dryer. Look for eco-friendly household products \u2013 made with environmentally friendly materials and packaging \u2013 such as cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, and personal care products. Take public transportation, walk, or bike instead of driving alone. This reduces your carbon footprint, saves money and promotes physical activity. Consider buying second-hand clothing and furniture, as this reduces the demand for new products and reduces waste. \u2013 Jen Gearing, change agent and founder of Rejenerate 21. Ditch your petrol ride for electric You\u2019ll save an average of 70% of carbon dioxide emitted while driving, and close to 100% when you charge your vehicle with renewable energy. Another advantage is that your vehicle won\u2019t pollute the air (hello, fresh air!) and you experience your drive in silence. With the current petrol prices, switching to electric is also good for your wallet. Easy change, right? \u2013 Maike van Grootel, managing partner at Niu Bali","filter_flag":1}

In 2023, the industry is expected to continue its growth as innovations such as precision agriculture, automation, and genetic engineering revolutionize the way food is produced and distributed. In the U.S., several major agribusiness companies have become leaders in their respective sectors. Companies like Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Tyson Foods, and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride have invested in advanced technologies and processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. These companies also work closely with local farmers to ensure they get the best product prices. Many of these large companies are also working on sustainable practices such as reducing water and energy use, minimizing waste, and enhancing soil health. Other key players in the U.S. agriculture industry include seed producers like Monsanto, Syngenta, and DuPont Pioneer and equipment manufacturers like Deere & Company, AGCO Corporation, and Kubota. These companies supply the tools and materials farmers need to operate their businesses. In addition to the companies mentioned above, thousands of independent farmers and ranchers throughout the country produce everything from fruits and vegetables to livestock and dairy products. They, too, rely on investments in technology and sustainable practices to remain competitive and maintain profitability. Overall, the agriculture industry in the U.S. is strong and vibrant, with companies across the sector continuing to invest in new ways of producing food while protecting the environment. As the population continues to grow, so will the need for more efficient and sustainable farming practices. IMPORTANCE In 2023, agricultural companies in the United States will remain important as the population grows and the demand for food increases. As a result, these companies will be responsible for producing a large portion of the nation\u2019s food and feedstock. This means that they will need to maintain high production standards, including quality control, efficient resource management, and reliable supply chains. Additionally, these companies will be challenged to find ways to reduce costs while still providing safe and nutritious food. They will also need to stay abreast of changing laws, regulations, and customer preferences to remain competitive. In addition to maintaining existing operations and investments, agricultural companies may look to new technologies and strategies, such as precision agriculture, to increase efficiency and production. Finally, they may explore new markets, such as export opportunities, or develop new products or services to meet changing demands. In summary, agricultural companies in the United States will remain an important part of the nation\u2019s economy in 2023 due to their ability to produce safe and nutritious food and feed on a large scale at an affordable cost.

The United States is a major producer of dairy products, with total milk production estimated to reach over 200 billion pounds from over 9.2 million dairy cows nationwide. Dairy farmers use various techniques and technologies to raise healthy, productive cows, including robotic milking systems, improved feed rations, and precision agriculture. In the U.S., most dairy farms are concentrated in states like California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Idaho. These states produce most of the country\u2019s milk, cheese, butter, and other dairy products. The U.S. also ranks highly in global dairy exports, with approximately 8% of all international dairy exports originating in the U.S. The American dairy industry is highly regulated and requires farmers to adhere to strict standards. All producers must register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comply with state and federal regulations regarding animal welfare, food safety, and environmental stewardship. This helps ensure that products produced by U.S. dairy farmers are of the highest quality. In addition to traditional farms, the dairy industry also includes dairy processing facilities, which are responsible for the manufacturing and packaging dairy products. Dairy processors have invested in modernizing their operations, including the purchase of new equipment and technology. This ensures that products remain fresh and safe for consumers. Overall, the U.S. dairy industry is expected to continue its strong performance in 2023 as it enjoys a sustained level of consumer demand and ongoing technological advances. IMPORTANCE Dairy farming is a vital industry in the United States and will remain so in 2023. Regarding economic importance, dairy farming contributes significantly to the economy through job creation, income generation, and export opportunities. Specifically, the U.S. dairy industry employed over 800,000 people in 2017 and generated $39 billion in revenue, with exports totalling $5.6 billion. In addition, the U.S. dairy sector influences agricultural research, technology advancements, and overall national food security. The U.S. dairy sector produces more than 200 million metric tons of milk and over 6 million metric tons of cheese annually. As of 2018, the US was the fourth largest milk producer, behind India, China, and the E.U. In addition, the dairy industry is responsible for providing nutrition to millions of Americans each year; according to the USDA, 49 per cent of American children aged 2-19 consume milk daily. The U.S. dairy industry faces several challenges in the coming years, including a changing climate, rising production costs, and increased competition from other countries. To combat these issues, dairy farmers must focus on improving efficiency and productivity, using new technologies such as precision agriculture, robotic milking systems, and automated feeding systems. Additionally, farmers must continue to promote the health benefits of dairy products and work to develop innovative products to meet consumer needs. Overall, dairy farming remains a significant and growing sector of the U.S. economy, contributing to job growth, income generation, and food security nationwide. With continued efforts to increase efficiency and productivity and promote the health benefits of dairy products, the U.S. dairy industry can continue to be a vital contributor to the U.S. economy in 2023 and beyond.
