The CPG sector significantly lags other industries in what BCG calls \u201cinnovation readiness,\u201d the underlying capabilities or \u201csystems\u201d that organizations deploy to generate new value propositions and profitably solve customer problems. According to our 2020 MIC findings, companies with mature innovation systems generate as much as 20% more innovation output than their peers. Concerned Consumers The lack of CPG preparedness is especially significant given consumers\u2019 growing climate concerns\u2014and the shift in their buying habits over the past few years. Approximately 80% of consumers say they think about sustainability in their day-to-day purchasing decisions. Also, according to the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business, between 2015 and 2021, sales of products marketed as sustainable grew 2.7 times faster than conventionally marketed products. However, today, only around 10% of CPG shoppers (8% to 18% across the categories we tested) say they purchase sustainable products or have sustainability in their top drivers of choice. This percentage could increase by up to 30% if CPG companies linked sustainability to other emotional and functional needs, such as quality or health. Other BCG research determined that 75% of consumers think that large companies must take the lead against climate change. Clearly, CPG companies must use this opportunity to raise the level of their sustainability efforts. Innovating on Three Levels Given the sheer size and complexity of the value chain, organizations that wish to achieve game-changing innovation in CPG must execute sustainability well at scale. This journey requires applying an innovation lens to three dimensions: products, customers, and advanced digital and AI tools. Improve Today\u2019s Products and Invent Tomorrow\u2019s As a first step toward greater sustainability, organizations should assess their product portfolio to identify the brands that can be made greener as well as those that require marketing to drive awareness and conversion. This is also the time to determine whether any brands should be divested because they don\u2019t align with corporate sustainability ambitions. That move can help fund opportunities in existing brands as well as new categories with greater potential. Product-development teams can then make existing products greener by replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones. Yet while this approach can provide some quick wins, it won\u2019t suffice over the long term. Based on our experience, re-engineering of current operations may achieve only about 30% to 40% of 2030 carbon goals; it is necessary to re-imagine the business model to close the gap, which will require both a transformational portfolio and consumer behavior change. Replacing unsustainable ingredients with sustainable ones won\u2019t suffice over the long term. To create truly sustainable products in the future, companies need to develop new products based on new formulations. (See the sidebar on Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev.) Since the primary source of CPG emissions is Scope 3 (the value chain, especially upstream), organizations need to ensure that their suppliers meet sustainability standards. How Two Leading CPGs Are Using Innovation to Boost Sustainability across the Value Chain Leading CPG companies like Nestl\u00e9 and AB InBev (ABI) have launched initiatives with the potential for large-scale impact as they put sustainability at the top of their ESG agenda, as well as their overall business agenda. Nestl\u00e9 Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. After determining the carbon footprint of its portfolio, the company has put more emphasis on expansion in the plant-based space, an important commercial and environmental opportunity. To make existing products carbon neutral, Nestl\u00e9 has substituted ingredients and changed entire formulations. The company\u2019s sustainable R&D accelerator and creative application of new R&D processes inspired the formulation used in brands such as Wunda, a pea-based milk alternative. Nestl\u00e9 has also committed to making its product packaging 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. In addition, it has shifted manufacturing to renewable energy and invested in more energy-efficient processes. And it has optimized routes and used low-emission fuels and rail transport. Together, these measures are projected to mitigate 14% of greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the projected 44 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalents by 2030. To fill out its plant-based portfolio, Nestl\u00e9 has also made some noteworthy acquisitions, including Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth foods. In parallel, the company has sold its North American bottled-water business, a slow-growing business with a large environmental footprint, to fund investments in higher-growth categories. This slew of product innovations has been enabled by Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team. A top CEO priority, sustainably minded innovation receives sufficient resources and focus. Moreover, teams are encouraged to explore emerging categories and find applications for R&D developments across the Nestl\u00e9 portfolio. For example, Nestl\u00e9 is using lessons from Wunda to develop other innovations in the dairy-alternative space. By embedding sustainability every step of the way, Nestl\u00e9 is driving both incremental and game-changing innovation\u2014and raising the bar in the process. ABI To help address the growing global demand for food and the pressure this is putting on natural resources, ABI is leveraging its brewing expertise to find new ways of sourcing food sustainably. In addition to rolling out many incremental innovations, ABI has launched ventures that develop new-to-world technologies. One of its startups, EverGrain, is developing a technology that extracts the proteins and fibers from brewing grains to create nutrient-rich ingredients for use in protein shakes, breads, and milk alternatives. Another startup, BioBrew, is using ABI\u2019s fermentation knowledge to scale production of alternative proteins. ABI\u2019s ventures are expected to help reduce crop- and livestock-related carbon emissions from food production while providing access to new markets Nestl\u00e9, an acknowledged sustainability leader, is innovating in various ways to meet its dual ambitions of zero environmental impact in operations by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.

This is a huge undertaking, requiring bold experimentation with supply-chain and sourcing models. Companies will need to expand their roster of partners. They will also need to change relationships with existing partners to active collaborations where companies share product-development expertise and work with suppliers to develop sustainable practices. Since CPG companies are positioned to be the steward of the value chain, they need to engage with partners to drive broader impact. Guinness, for example, recently launched a regenerative-agriculture pilot in Ireland to reduce the carbon emissions from producing barley, a key raw material. Working with farmers and other suppliers, Guinness expects to see improvements in soil health and water quality, as well as enhanced biodiversity. Help Consumers Change Their Behaviors While these efforts will go a long way, innovation in CPG won\u2019t be able to maximize the impact of decarbonization measures unless consumers take a more active role. Yet while consumers are increasingly concerned about the climate crisis, many have not yet incorporated sustainability into their everyday behaviors, and many are confused about their role (around 20% say that individuals have a role to play in climate change). Companies, therefore, need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. One solution is to innovate and commercialize products in a way that resonates deeply with potential buyers, understanding their core needs and barriers to ensure that sustainable products address them. To maximize the impact of decarbonization measures, companies need to activate consumer behaviors that will stick. That is exactly what Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s Finish did in 2020, when the maker of dishwashing products launched \u201cSkip the Rinse,\u201d a campaign that aimed to drive growth and also conserve water by encouraging consumers not to pre-rinse their dishes. Reckitt innovated its product, and the key benefit was that busy families could save time and effort while effectively cleaning their dishes, which appealed to a much broader audience than sustainability alone. As an added benefit, for every consumer who pledged to #skiptherinse, Finish agreed to donate $1 to The Nature Conservancy. In less than two years, more than 20 million gallons of water were conserved. In addition, Finish drove share growth and increased marketing ROI. Deploy Next-Generation Digital and AI Tools Advanced analytics driven by AI provide the transparency that\u2019s necessary for identifying the C&S leads with the greatest likelihood of success. These next-generation tools include machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping, Unlike traditional methods, advanced analytics allow an organization to combine multiple data sources to identify potential targets across multiple sectors globally and further upstream. Moreover, they enable the automated scraping of websites and social media to identify business signals (triggers) in areas of the organization\u2019s choosing, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Third, they help to quickly narrow down searches to a short list of the most promising opportunities. No less important, these tools enable traceability, both for companies that wish to monitor the greenness of their suppliers and for consumers who want to know whether the product they\u2019re thinking of purchasing has green roots. Advanced analytics can help identify C&S leads and enable traceability. Given both the immensity of the C&S opportunity and our relative nascency in addressing it, advanced analytics and AI tools (including machine learning, natural-language processing, and geo-mapping) can help drive impact at critical junctures across the innovation value chain. Companies deploying these tools will be better able to surface valuable insights, prioritize the innovation focus, explore the C&S implications of potential product features during the design stage, and identify emerging technologies and partners to add to their innovation ecosystems. In all likelihood, CPG companies will play a central role in the ultimate success or failure of the C&S effort. Therefore, it\u2019s only fitting that they use this role to bring us closer to a decarbonized future. By applying an innovative lens to the sustainability agenda, companies can create value\u2014for the environment, for consumers, and for themselves. But to create a real sustainability advantage, organizations must act now, before this source of differentiation evaporates.","filter_flag":1}

This element is a critical building block for everything from electric vehicles and energy-efficient buildings to a modernized electrical grid. And unlike other basic materials such as steel and plastic, aluminum can be infinitely recycled with no loss of quality. About 75 percent of all the aluminum ever produced is still in use today. About the authors The analysis underlying this summary article was a collaborative effort by Pedro Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, Jeffrey Lorch, Kayla Olson, Reinaldo Penso, Matthias St\u00fcrtz, and Alex Ulanov . The insights were developed as part of McKinsey's knowledge partnership with the Mission Possible Partnership for the report Aluminum decarbonization at a cost that makes sense. While the metal itself is sustainable, its production usually is not. Although abundant in the Earth\u2019s soil and rocks, aluminum does not occur in its pure form and has to be extracted from compounds\u2014a complicated process of refining and smelting that requires a large and constant load of electricity. To produce this energy, many countries rely on coal. Globally, about 55 percent of the electricity needed for aluminum smelters comes from coal-fired power plants (with 10 percent from natural-gas plants and 30 percent from hydropower). As a result, the aluminum industry is among the highest-emitting sectors in the world, accounting for about 2 percent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The challenge of radical decarbonization To achieve an emissions pathway consistent with 1.5\u00b0C of global warming (as envisioned by the Paris Agreement on climate change), the aluminum industry will need to slash emissions dramatically\u2014from around 15.9 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) per metric ton of primary aluminum (nonrecycled) today to lower than 0.5 tCO 2 e\/t by 2050, according to the International Aluminium Institute. Progress is already under way. In China, which produces nearly 60 percent of the world\u2019s primary aluminum, the country\u2019s largest producer has shifted much of its capacity to the hydropower-rich Yunnan province. Many companies are also exploring green technologies, including carbon capture and storage; inert-anode technology, which avoids the formation of CO 2 ; and mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), which recycles waste heat to improve efficiency. The industry\u2019s current pipeline of green projects, however, is likely not enough to achieve this ambitious 95 percent reduction target. An investment model for change To explore the potential for change, Mission Possible Partnership\u2019s Aluminium for Climate team, with analytical support from McKinsey\u2019s Basic Materials Insights and McKinsey Sustainability, has developed an open-access, open-source investment model for alumina and aluminum plant decarbonization. The user-friendly model creates a twin lens on costs and technology options for a variety of emissions scenarios. The model is structured to allow alumina refineries, aluminum producers, OEMs, upstream players, finance players, policy makers, and end-industry users to input their assumptions and compare investment scenarios with best available technologies. Refer to the report for examples from this model for five different decarbonization scenarios. To accelerate the pace of decarbonization, bold action is required on multiple fronts, as explored in a new report by the Mission Possible Partnership with analytical support from McKinsey. No easy answer exists. Producing greener aluminum isn\u2019t a simple matter of swapping out coal generation with renewable energy. Throughout each stage of aluminum production, large amounts of constant-load energy are required. Although the end goal is to make clean or renewable energy central to the production process, the most cost-efficient and effective way to get there is likely to involve a range of technologies and solutions (see sidebar, \u201cAn investment model for change\u201d). Options for producing greener aluminum Any effort to produce low-carbon aluminum has to directly address the supply of electricity required for the smelting process, in which aluminum is extracted from its oxide, alumina. Roughly 80 percent of primary aluminum GHG emissions are generated from smelting, of which 81 percent are associated with the electricity used for electrolysis. For aluminum smelters that have opted to supply this energy from their own power plants, as opposed to obtaining energy from the grid, solar or wind generation can be a useful addition. But due to their intermittency, these renewable sources won\u2019t be able to fully power the process. To generate large, stable loads, some producers have turned to hydropower. But this option potentially has limited growth, is regionally specific, and may be impacted by potential droughts. Nuclear energy, in the form of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), offers promise but is still at an early stage. For many smelters with their own generation ability, the most realistic short- to medium-term option may be retrofitting coal-fired power plants or natural-gas combined cycle plants with carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). Aluminum smelting operations that get their electricity from the grid have two potential options. One is to enter into virtual power purchase agreements (VPPA) with utilities. These agreements, which allow aluminum producers to claim GHG reductions, could achieve several goals. They could potentially support new renewable-energy projects, help accelerate a utility\u2019s migration to low-carbon electricity, and provide a hedge against future energy price movements. An alternate option is a strategic relocation to regions that already have significant amounts of green electricity. The process of refining the sedimentary rock bauxite oxide to produce alumina also generates GHG emissions, albeit far fewer than smelting (17 percent of aluminum\u2019s total emissions). Decarbonizing this process will mean shifting the fuel source for thermal boilers away from coal and heavy fuel such as diesel and oil. Producers in countries with access to reliable natural gas could switch to natural-gas-fired boilers and calciners, although this option will likely only reduce refining emissions by about one-third. More widely applicable alternatives that could reduce nearly all thermal refining emissions are electric boilers powered by either wind or solar, hydrogen boilers supplied with green hydrogen, or boilers that employ MVR technology, an energy recovery process that can be used to recycle waste heat. How stakeholders can help One of the challenges to aluminum decarbonization is that the best currently available fossil-fuel-based technology has a net present value greater than the green alternative. Overcoming these economic obstacles and mitigating potential risks will likely require collaborative action among stakeholders. Banks, investors, policy makers, and end customers can each play an important role. The finance sector. Decarbonization won\u2019t be cheap. Globally and across industries, the net-zero transition is projected to demand average annual spending of $9.2 trillion by 2050. Aluminum producers will need to retire fossil-fuel-based production and make new investments in low-carbon alternatives, even though these are likely to have a lower return on capital and entail a certain amount of technology and implementation risk. Financial institutions have the capability to mitigate some of these risks and shift cash flows toward green investments. Given the generally high levels of debt in the aluminum industry, improved interest rates for low-carbon investments and new products such as green loans or bonds used exclusively for climate-friendly projects could be key enablers. Additionally, banks could incorporate climate considerations into their lending decisions, such as those developed by the Center for Climate-Aligned Finance (CAF). Financial partnerships designed to support sustainable investment are already happening, such as the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which brings together banks representing 40 percent of global banking assets. Governments and policy makers. Government grants to aluminum producers could potentially help offset some of the costs of green investment, while carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) could bring the operational costs of decarbonized operations in line with those of fossil-fuel-based technology. However, the analysis shows that the greatest impact to the economics of decarbonization could come from carbon pricing, whether through trading schemes or carbon taxes. This could spur investment in green aluminum and enable the economics of the industry\u2019s net-zero transition. Customers. Aluminum users likely have an important role to play in creating demand and helping shift the industry toward decarbonization. This could include what the report estimates to be a 5 to 10 percent premium for green aluminum or by making firm advance commitments to purchase it. Such offtake agreements could be negotiated before a factory is constructed or begins operating or before major retrofits are undertaken, significantly cutting potential investment risk. For manufacturers that have set decarbonization goals for their sourcing and supply chains, such premiums may be worth paying. Rising demand for low-carbon products is pushing the aluminum industry away from the carbon-emitting processes that have dominated production for the past 135 years. At the same time, the dynamics of a warming planet are evidence that change needs to happen as fast as possible. To make the green transition a reality, players throughout the aluminum value chain could seize the moment, work together to support a purposeful transition, and recreate the industry for the demands of the coming decades.","filter_flag":1}

It\u2019s a pretty remote stretch of highway in Frederick County, surrounded mainly by cornfields. Many of the trucks are stopping at Laurel Sand and Gravel, a massive quarry and mining operation off the main road, where 600,000 tons of small stones are ground into powder every year. The powder, known as aggregate, is sold to the concrete industry as a thickening agent. The property is pockmarked by mounds of rocks and gravel, giant construction equipment, and industrial-sized chutes, tunnels, bridges and conveyor belts. It\u2019s also got a natural deep pool, which is used as a training ground for U.S. and Israeli military divers, local first responders and police deepwater investigators. The Frederick County government had to grant the property a special zoning designation to allow for commercial scuba diving operations. Amidst this clamorous contemporary moonscape, a local businessman, Brad Hill, is thinking about a carbon-free future \u2014 but taking his inspiration from Ancient Rome. Hill, who leases most of the land to Laurel Sand and Gravel, also runs a business there called Comus Sustainable Pozzolan Products. Hill has invented a way to dramatically reduce the pollutants that go into the concrete manufacturing process. His patent relies on mixing cement without burning coal and other toxins at high temperatures. And he\u2019s using a natural thickener, Pozzolan, that\u2019s as old as civilized society itself. \u201cYou have clean cement because you don\u2019t have to use fossil fuels in our product,\u201d Hill \u2014 a trained astrophysicist \u2014 explains. Not only is it climate-friendly, he asserts, but it\u2019s cheaper and considerably more durable than most of the concrete on the market. Hill\u2019s once-lonely quest to produce cleaner cement and concrete is now finding receptive ears in government and in certain sectors of the building industry itself. The fledgling \u201cBuy Clean\u201d movement for the construction and building industries, which focuses on using less carbon-intensive materials, is becoming embedded in federal policy, with a goal of zero carbon emissions in the construction sector by the year 2050. \u201cThis helps fill an enormous hole in the push to reduce industrial emissions,\u201d said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a national coalition of labor unions and environmental organizations. Speaking last week at a Washington, D.C., conference on the Buy Clean idea, sponsored by the BlueGreen Alliance and Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, Walsh described Buy Clean not just as an effort to combat climate change, but as a way to reinvigorate the country\u2019s struggling manufacturing sector and create good-paying union jobs. Four states, led by California, have enacted Buy Clean laws of their own. And just a few weeks ago, a dozen states, including Maryland, signed on to the Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership, a proposed procurement policy. The state governments have committed to seeking lower-carbon infrastructure materials, including concrete and steel, in state-funded projects. And they\u2019ve agreed to collaborate with the federal government and one another in an effort to transform the marketplace. The federal-state partnership, Walsh said, \u201cwill give certainty to businesses that there is a large, stable market to buy these cleaner products. How we buy things matters.\u201d Maryland may also be taking tentative steps toward establishing a Buy Clean policy of its own for construction. A bill that passed in the House of Delegates last month would instruct the Maryland Department of General Services to assess the global warming impact of each category of cement or concrete mixture used in the construction of a public project. Beginning July 1, 2025, state agencies would be required to specify in each solicitation for a government-funded construction project the cement or concrete mixture that would be used in the building materials, and prioritize proposals with the lowest carbon footprint. Bidders would be required to submit environmental product declarations \u2014 a fairly new concept in the building sector that has been described as nutrition labels for greenhouse gas emissions. The bill, which stalled during last year\u2019s General Assembly session, has a week to make it through the Senate and to Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s (D) desk. One large multinational cement company has embraced the legislation, and so have environmental groups, which argue that any attempt to regulate the emissions of the construction industry creates a benefit for the climate. \u201cHow can you know the environmental impact of a building or structure if you don\u2019t know what the products are going into it are going to be doing?\u201d said Zachary Lovett, a Baltimore-based project pursuit manager for Holcim US, part of a Swiss building construction materials conglomerate. But some construction industry associations in Maryland are opposing the measure, saying it would place too much of a financial burden on smaller companies that do not have the ability to keep a large inventory of concrete mixes or stick an environmental label on every one of their products. And they suggested that any state Buy Clean program should run through the Maryland Department of Transportation rather than the Department of General Services, because so many construction projects, like roads and the massive operations at the Port of Baltimore, are controlled by MDOT. In written testimony, Marshall Klinefelter, president of the Maryland Asphalt Association, said his group\u2019s members appreciate the intent of the legislation, but \u201cstrongly feel that the market should dictate the types of materials needed for construction projects. If these vague determinations are set, we have serious concerns that it will make it nearly impossible to adhere to. Setting preferences also pits producers against each other, giving an unfair advantage to those that meet the requirements.\u201d The bill would, however, provide state grants for ready-mix concrete companies to buy the technology they need to make cleaner concrete. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way how, if this bill goes through, it puts any companies at a disadvantage,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cIn fact, I think it gives the smarter companies an advantage.\u201d The measure passed 103-31 in the House on March 20. Every Democrat present voted for it, along with five Republicans. The bill and its Senate companion are now sitting in the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, which has held hearings on both versions. \u2018The most widely used material on the planet besides water\u2019 The building industry is one of the worst polluters on the planet, because concrete is so ubiquitous. It\u2019s not just used on roads and buildings but on bridges and dams, ports and airports, trails and sidewalks, playgrounds, swimming pools, skate parks, patios, fountains, statuary, indoor construction, and so much more. \u201cConcrete is the most widely used material on the planet besides water,\u201d is how Del. Ken Kerr (D-Frederick), the House sponsor of the Buy Clean bill in Annapolis, puts it. The concrete industry accounts for about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and most of that is attributable to the way cement is made, in a kiln, often fueled by coal, that heats to over 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. That creates a chemical reaction with a high level of carbon emissions. When cement is mixed with water, sand and other aggregates like those mined and crushed at Laurel Sand and Gravel in Frederick County, it becomes concrete. \u201cIf the concrete industry were a country, it would be in the top five of carbon-producing nations in the world,\u201d said state Sen. Sarah Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel), the Senate sponsor of the state\u2019s green construction legislation. The U.S. government is using its purchasing power to try to combat climate change. The federal government is the largest direct purchaser in the world and one of the leading funders of infrastructure projects. It owns 8,000 buildings across the country and is the largest purchaser of electric power. It\u2019s also the largest fleet operator in the U.S. The Biden administration is targeting decades-old methods of manufacturing and urging the building industry to find alternative, less carbon-intensive ways of producing cement and concrete, steel and other construction materials. The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, includes $6 billion for the Department of Energy to dole out grants to concrete and cement manufacturers to find alternative means of production. The administration announced last year that it was creating a Federal Buy Clean Initiative, prioritizing the purchase of low carbon materials for government construction projects, with a goal of covering 98% of materials purchased by the federal government. The U.S. Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency and General Service Administration and other agencies are developing regulations to favor contractors that use low-carbon products on building projects. Robin Carnahan, the administrator of the General Services Administration, told the Buy Clean conference in D.C. last week that her agency is targeting asphalt, concrete, glass and steel as it develops regulations for cleaner construction. \u201cTurns out that the four are pretty heavy emitters of carbon in the supply chain,\u201d she said. \u201cThese supply chain emissions are things we know we\u2019re going to be able to make a significant impact on.\u201d And there\u2019s an international component to the government\u2019s effort: Through John Kerry, the erstwhile U.S. senator and secretary of State who is serving as President Biden\u2019s envoy on climate change, the U.S. has organized major corporations from across the globe into the First Movers Coalition. These companies have agreed to purchase at least 10% near-zero carbon cement and concrete for their operations by 2030. Four states have passed Buy Clean laws of their own. And New Jersey is working on a regulation that not only sets benchmarks for concrete manufacturers to meet but provides financial incentives for companies that go beyond the proposed climate-friendly standards. Buy Clean is also now on the radar of the U.S. Climate Alliance, the coalition of two dozen states and territories, including Maryland, that formed after former President Trump pulled the U.S. out of international climate pacts. While there are no formal agreements yet between the states, one goal, said Kareem Hammoud, a senior policy analyst at the U.S. Climate Alliance, is ensuring that whatever Buy Clean standards they enact are reasonably well-aligned with one another, so construction industry suppliers do not have to scramble from state to state. \u201cWe\u2019re not just target-setting organizations,\u201d Hammoud said. \u201cGovernors commit to real action.\u201d \u201cBut for many states,\u201d he conceded, \u201cthis is a very new area.\u201d \u2018This isn\u2019t new stuff\u2019 Brad Hill calls himself \u201ca cement guy.\u201d He has owned construction companies and helped build power plants, cement plants and other energy infrastructure. He was working as a civil contractor at the Lehigh Cement plant in Union Bridge \u2014 10 miles from Woodsboro \u2014 when he bought the company\u2019s quarry in Woodsboro 15 years ago. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d do with it. \u201cI had to figure out what I\u2019d bought,\u201d he recalled. Eventually Hill came to realize that the rock deposits on the property, formed from the wearing down of the Appalachian Mountains, contained many of the same properties that are found in the volcanic ash at Mount Vesuvius in Italy \u2014 which literally helped build the Roman Empire. Hill thought about the durability of so many of the buildings and infrastructure from Ancient Rome, including famous structures like the Pantheon and the Colosseum, and compared that to the dramatically shorter life-cycle of modern concrete. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is 2,000-year-old stuff that we\u2019ve got here.\u201d Hill concluded that he wanted to start promoting the use of Pozzolan in U.S. construction. He also thought about how the concrete industry essentially tries to reproduce the natural chemical explosions of a volcanic eruption, but in an unnatural, carbon-intensive way. \u201cWe burn so much fossil fuel to get it to mimic Vesuvius,\u201d he said. So he began tinkering and eventually invented a system that he says reproduces the chemical reaction at cold temperatures, powered by giant rollers controlled by air currents, rather than using extreme heat. Thus, the so-called Hill Process was born, and Hill launched Comus Sustainable Pozzolan Products as a spinoff of one of his construction companies. Hill believes that by using a less carbon-intensive method of producing concrete, he can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in several ways: Through the cold-temperature chain reaction, which in turn will produce concrete that weighs half as much as standard concrete and has a greater life cycle, which in turn will require fewer road repairs, which contribute to climate change, and fewer truck trips to quarries like the one he owns and that\u2019s used by Laurel Sand and Gravel. Down the road at Hill\u2019s old employer, executives at Lehigh Hanson, Inc., which operates the Lehigh Cement plant in Union Bridge, announced last summer that the plant would fully transition from producing ordinary Portland cement to making an eco-friendly product, beginning this year. The company said it was using new technology to reduce the energy required to produce the product and associated emissions \u2014 making for a carbon footprint that is up to 10% less than ordinary Portland cement. But some people in the industry say it\u2019s easy for big companies to make dramatic changes and substantial investments in new products and equipment. Lehigh Cement is owned by Heidelberg Materials, a German-based international company. \u201cIf you\u2019re forcing smaller firms to manage and hold different types of concrete, essentially what you\u2019re doing is pushing out some of the smaller guys,\u201d said Michael Sakata, president and CEO of the Maryland Transportation Builders and Materials Association. Sakata said that many manufacturers are making innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when they can, \u201cbut if we are going to invest and make things cleaner, we definitely need a push\u201d from the federal government. Hill feels the same way. While U.S. and European regulators are evaluating his method for creating greener concrete, he and a team of scientists continue to refine the system. \u201cBreaking big rocks into little rocks is big science,\u201d he says. Last summer, U.S. Rep. David Trone (D-6th) visited his quarry, and Hill credits Trone and other members of Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation for embracing his work and securing funding for operations like his.

And it's an industry trend that, fortunately, doesn't seem to be losing steam. From fashion houses to beverage brands, businesses are seeking out innovative ways to produce reusable products without depleting natural resources by using renewable sources of energy and reducing their carbon footprint\u2014all while maintaining ethical business practices that extend beyond the physical environment, i.e., promoting equality and inclusion in the workplace. Of course, the growing trend\u2014and the corporate response to it\u2014has been heavily influenced by climate change as well as the awareness and socio-economic changes prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But what's keeping it going? According to recent research, the sustainability movement is mainly driven by consumer demand. In the 2021 Global Sustainability Study, 85% of people said they've shifted their purchasing habits toward more sustainable products in the past five years\u2014and more than one-third of the population is willing to pay more to get them. But sustainability isn't just an investment in our companies; it's an investment in our planet. So as more companies commit to more environmentally-friendly and ethical practices to give consumers what they want, the question becomes, how do we make sustainability, well, sustainable? The answer lies in closed loop systems. Here is how restructuring global commerce to a circular model can create a more sustainable future for our planet. What is a closed loop system? A closed loop system, a.k.a. a circular system or economy, is a way to reduce or eliminate waste, as products and materials can be used to create new products. We use a circular system at SodaStream. Once consumers finish a CO2 cylinder, they can exchange for a fresh one online or in-store at participating retailers nationwide. That CO2 cylinder is then shipped back to a plant to be cleaned, filled, and sealed for reuse. The focus of our closed loop system is reusability and regeneration through every step of the supply chain. Conversely, with an open loop system, materials and products have a very limited lifespan and ultimately end up as waste. We can see how circular systems work in other industries, including fashion. According to Earth.org, a staggering 85% of textiles end up in a landfill on a yearly basis in America. To reduce that statistic, fashion subscription brand, For Days, collects used garments that are then chopped up and spun into yarn to make new fabric. The sustainable label Reformation has a program that allows buyers to return worn merchandise for a credit toward new stuff. The old clothing is turned into fibers for new products. Many well-known food and beverage, personal care, and household products are also available via the e-commerce and in-person retailer LOOP, created by TerraCycle, a global company specializing in tackling hard-to-recycle waste. Through this waste-free shopping platform, consumers can purchase their favorite products in reusable packaging. Once finished, customers can have them picked up by LOOP (or return them to an in-person site) to be refilled and reused. SodaStream\u2019s closed loop on a broader scale A move to a circular economy for our brand strongly aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically goal number 12: Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns. According to the UN, unsustainable practices are the root causes of pollution, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. And our reliance on natural resources is rising over 65% globally. How does a circular economy impact climate change? Products are manufactured, consumed, collected, and remanufactured into new products\u2014an infinite loop designed to eliminate waste. Corporations can use fewer resources overall, reduce greenhouse gas emissions (70% of emissions stem from material use), and decrease global waste, including the reliance on landfills. The sustainable future Sustainability is not a trend to court new customers; it\u2019s the path to a healthier planet if it\u2019s done correctly. Open loop systems that don\u2019t account for the product once it\u2019s been bought by the consumer are not the answer, even if the materials can be recycled. Looking ahead, the goal of closed loop solutions is zero waste. According to the investment fund Closed Loop Partners, in 2021 alone, closed loop solutions kept 3.6 million tons of materials in circulation and avoided 6.8 million tons of greenhouse emissions. And for our part, one SodaStream reusable bottle saves thousands of single-use plastic bottles, and by 2025, we will save up to 76 billion single-use plastic bottles from our planet. The message behind these numbers is clear: to keep sustainability going\u2014and address the mounting concerns about climate change\u2014closed loop systems, where the materials are always in use and not in the trash, are essential to have around.

That's why we've created Coachtopia as both a discovery lab to pioneer circularity in fashion and a collaborative platform for change,\" says Joon Silverstein, SVP, Global Marketing, Creative and Sustainability at Coach and Head of Coachtopia. \"We know that to transform our impacts, we need to fundamentally shift mindsets\u2014from seeing opportunity in waste to designing backwards to taking a more open-source approach to creativity. We've built Coachtopia as an entirely new world within Coach\u2014an agile start-up with a mission to reimagine the end-to-end system. We're building it not just for our consumers, but with them, inviting a growing community of hundreds of Gen Z individuals to join us on our Slack channel, collaborate with us on products, take center stage in our content and campaigns\u2014and reimagine our future together.\" Designed for and with a new generation of consumers who are increasingly passionate about addressing the climate crisis and determined to drive change, Coachtopia is resetting the paradigm between brand and consumer, co-creating a new brand in collaboration with a growing community of Gen Z individuals\u2014from climate activists, designers and upcyclers to journalists, film makers, entrepreneurs and fashion enthusiasts. The Coachtopian community has been actively involved in Coachtopia since its earliest founding days, with members continually sharing their perspectives on circular fashion, shaping concepts, and setting expectations of the change they want to see. As part of its mission, Coachtopia is investing in this next generation of talent through collaborative programs, harnessing and showcasing new talent to find solutions to the problems facing fashion. \"We were inspired by our shared desire to do better for the planet by inventing new circular ways of dreaming, designing and creating,\" said Coach Creative Director Stuart Vevers. \"It's a bigger, bolder step forward in realizing our vision for sustainability at Coach, where we prioritize experimenting and learning, and ethical design intentions over cookie cutter perfection. Coachtopia takes this to a new level by challenging us to 'design in reverse,' with the end goal of circularity top of mind, in collaboration with the next generation and their optimistic vision for tomorrow.\" Coachtopia is a world in progress\u2014advancing iteratively towards a continually evolving vision of circularity. It builds upon the investments that Coach is making to improve the end-to-end sustainability of its business, as well as the learnings and capabilities developed through the brand's Coach (Re)Loved program. By giving a second life to more than 20,000 Coach products since its April 2021 launch, Coach (Re)Loved has provided critical insights into the aspects of traditional luxury craftsmanship that make circularity challenging, and thus the need to design for circularity from the start in order to achieve it at scale. Coachtopia takes up this challenge, innovating through rapid prototyping and forming a continuous feedback loop with Coach to drive mutual progress. Coachtopia launches today with an all-gender collection of bags, accessories, ready-to-wear and footwear made with recycled, repurposed and renewable materials and designed with our Made Circular\u2122 principles in mind. As Coachtopia grows, it will continue to innovate through limited drops of experimental products that push circular craft ever further\u2014with a commitment to take back every product at end-of-life for reuse, remaking or recycling. Each bag, wallet, footwear and ready- to-wear product also comes with a unique digital passport\u2014accessed via an embedded NFC chip\u2014that gives customers transparency into its materials, Made Circular\u2122 design and impacts. This digital passport also provides the means to follow the product's journey as it is repaired, restored, reused and reimagined over multiple lives. Coachtopia is available today on Coach.com in the US, Canada and UK and in Selfridges, London. Coachtopia will then launch in Spitalfields, London on April 28; Coach stores across the US including Coach House Fifth Avenue, New York; N. Michigan Avenue, Chicago; The Grove, Los Angeles; and Dadeland, Miami; and additional Selfridges stores across the UK in May; Coach House Regent Street, London in early June; and Coach Soho, New York in July.

A world of circular craft In today's linear fashion system, over 85% of materials produced end up incinerated or as waste in landfill. Through its Made Circular\u2122 principles, Coachtopia is working to design out waste and reduce the use of new materials\u2014the creation of which accounts for 38%* of the fashion industry's greenhouse gas emissions\u2014while helping to keep products out of landfill by designing them to be reused over many lives. Coachtopia's Made Circular\u2122 principles are as follows: Craft with recycled, repurposed or renewable materials. Exploring new ways to craft from what already exists, with a mission to avoid the creation of new, virgin materials in making Coachtopia products. The leathers used in Coachtopia products are either ingeniously Upcrafted from Coach production waste or made with at least 50% recycled leather scraps from tanneries. Other materials used across the range include 95%+ recycled cotton for hoodies and T-shirts, a colorful 70%+ recycled resin for bag straps and hardware, 100% recycled polyester for canvas totes and webbing on footwear and a 40% bio-based renewable Sugarcane EVA for footwear soles.

Key innovations include: Upcrafted leather Upcrafted leather is made from Coach production waste, specifically, the scraps of leather left over after Coach bag patterns are cut from leather hides, through processes that are only possible thanks to Coach's 80+ years of leather expertise. In the launch collection, the Ergo and Wavy Dinky bags have been reimagined using a range of different Upcrafted techniques, including patchwork, weaving, appliqu\u00e9, sequins, pressed leathers and scrap binding, that transform Coach waste\u2014from leather cutting room scraps to zipper ends\u2014 into unique artisanal styles. Key styles include the Ergo and Wavy Dinky in Checkerboard Upcrafted Leather. Coachtopia Leather Coachtopia leather is made with at least 50% recycled leather scraps from tanneries. Though it's made with waste, it sacrifices nothing in terms of style: Coachtopia has worked with its partners to ensure Coachtopia leather has the premium finish, grain and hand feel that you would expect from a Coach leather product. All bags and leather goods in the launch collection are available in Coachtopia leather variations, including styles that come with a unique Upcrafted binding made from Coach production leather scraps. 70% Recycled Resin As part of Coachtopia's mission to design for multiple lives, several styles in the launch collection come with easily detachable handles crafted in a colorful resin made from at least 70% recycled plastic waste, sorted by color and then extruded into new materials in one-of-a-kind patterns and colors. This recycled resin is also used across the collection for select hardware details and hangtags. A Shift Towards \"Nothing New\" Throughout the collection Coachtopia has examined every detail of its products with a view to replacing virgin materials with recycled, repurposed or renewable ones. The leather linings of Coachtopia bags are made with at least 50% recycled leather scraps. The thread used to stitch them is 100% recycled polyester. The plastic hardware in bags and small accessories is made from at least 70% recycled resin. Ready-to-wear is crafted in 95%+ recycled cotton or repurposed denim deadstock. Even the labels inside each product are 100% recycled polyester or nylon. Additionally, Coachtopia's at least 75% recycled packaging has been designed to be multi-functional to reduce material use and is printed with renewable Algae Ink.\u2122 Powered by Community Coachtopia is being built as a community in which a new generation of fashion enthusiasts, creatives, entrepreneurs, activists and more are invited to participate through collaborative discussions, projects and opportunities. It's a platform for change in which emerging Gen Z voices help create the future they want to see. The Coachtopia Beta Community Coachtopia has been built on the passion of the Coachtopia Beta Community, a global and growing network of diverse and inspiring Gen Z individuals who are feeding their perspectives and ideas into Coachtopia products, messages and concepts as they are developed. They are united by a desire to drive positive change and help build a better future for fashion. \"We want to be part of the conversation because we see what the world will be like if we don't make change.\" Sophie Lowery, 20, film student and Coachtopia Beta Community founding member Collaborative drops Through limited-edition product collaborations, Coachtopia is inviting emerging talents to show- case their creativity and bring new and inspiring perspectives to bear on fashion's challenges. The brand's first collaboration is with graphic designer and illustrator Sabrina Lau, whose original art- work for Coachtopia's launch drop is inspired by her love of texture and surreal juxtaposition, as well as her encounters with nature throughout her home city of New York. \"Honestly, it was like a fever dream. It really did feel like a true collaboration\u2014it was very open. And to be the first one to kick it off is truly an honor.\" Sabrina Lau, 25, collaborating graphic designer and Coachtopia Beta Community member Designing the future With the Coach Foundation, Coachtopia is sup- porting the passion and ingenuity of tomorrow's design talent. The CFDA x Coach Dream It Real Circular Design Scholarship has been awarded to 15 students passionate about making fashion more circular. Coachtopia has invited these scholars to participate in a \"Coachtopia Waste Contest\" in which, with mentorship from the Coachtopia team, they worked to develop new creative uses for Coach leather scraps. Select projects will be brought to market as limited edition drops. \"Going through the design and production process with the Coachtopia team pushed me to design with a new perspective. [The experience] has given me a lot more confidence in designing for circularity\u2014 and has inspired me to always leave a positive impact with the products I make.\" Vivian Luo, 21, fashion design student at The New School and Coachtopia Beta Community member. Community-driven storytelling As part of its collaborative ethos, Coachtopia is putting its community at the forefront of its campaigns and storytelling\u2014engaging its broader audience in meaningful conversations around circular fashion through the voices of the inspiring and diverse group of individuals in the growing Coachtopian community. These community members are featured in the launch campaign, web content and a range of digital assets that take us behind-the-scenes in the making of Coachtopia, working both in front of and behind the camera. \"As a sustainability consultant and designer I've been bringing my voice and expertise to Coachtopia. They are collaborating with us, with the next generation of artists, activists and designers. Coachtopia has created a unique community of like-minded people in the sustainability and fashion spaces.\" Maya Penn, 23, climate activist, sustainable fashion designer and artist and Coachtopia Beta Community member. The Launch Campaign In its launch campaign, Coachtopia is paying tribute to its growing community, bringing together nine Gen Z talents, along with Coachtopia's designer and master craftsperson, who represent the breadth of voices feeding into the brand's products, messages and long-term vision: Lola Tung, actor Maya Penn, climate activist sustainable fashion designer and artist Caulin Donaldson (aka Trash Caulin), climate activist and creator Sabrina Lau, graphic designer Natalia Spotts, vintage and second-hand boutique owner Tyler McGillivary, fashion designer and upcycler Aditi Mayer, climate activist, photojournalist and speaker Sinn Chhin, makeup artist and designer Rahmir Meggett, fashion designer, entrepreneur and model Trey Denis, Coachtopia designer Mauricio Alvarado, Coachtopia master craftsperson The campaign film is directed by filmmaker Adrien Lagier, and the images were shot by photographer Remi Ferrante.

To drive that progress and measure its impacts, Coachtopia is collaborating with partners across the industry who share its mission for driving positive change through innovation. Key Partners The Ellen MacArthur Foundation The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a non-profit committed to driving the global transition towards a circular economy and sharing learnings about its benefits for biodiversity, climate change and waste reduction. Coachtopia's Made Circular\u2122 principles have been informed by The Ellen Mac- Arthur Foundation's vision of a circular economy for fashion where products are used more, made to be made again and made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs. Coachtopia's parent company, Tapestry, is a Network Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. ReCircled ReCircled is an innovative recycling and takeback company that helps keep pre-loved products and materials in circulation at their highest value, saving them from being sent to landfill. Coachtopia is working with ReCircled to help recycle otherwise unusable materials. For example, packaging waste and materials from unrepairable Coach products have been reimagined into new Coachtopia materials, such as the filling for the Coachtopia furniture ottomans in select stores. EON Coachtopia has partnered with EON, fashion's leading product cloud platform, to create a unique, cloud-based digital passport for each Coachtopia product, accessed via a scannable NFC chip or QR code embedded in the product. Through this partnership, Coachtopia is harnessing technological innovation to meet the need for data-driven circularity in an environment where clarity and transparency on the lifecycle of every product is increasingly vital. By connecting a product's digital passport to their account, Coachtopia customers can access a range of circular services that will help to prolong the lifespan of their product. Gen Phoenix Coachtopia has worked with Gen Phoenix, an innovative sustainable materials company, to develop a soft and durable uncoated leather lining, used in many Coachtopia products, made with at least 50% recycled leather scraps and 75% total recycled content. Gen Phoenix uses a patented hydroentanglement technology to create high quality materials from recycled leather waste, specifically offcuts from tanneries that might otherwise have been sent to landfill. Building on this Coachtopia partnership, Tapestry, the parent company of Coach, has invested in Gen Phoenix as part of the company's recent funding round. Everywhere Apparel We source the minimum 95% recycled cotton fabrics for Coachtopia T-shirts and hoodies through Everywhere Apparel, a company that collects, sorts and shreds pre- and post-consumer waste materials to create new yarns and fabrics. When a piece of Coachtopia clothing is no longer usable, we plan to work with Everywhere Apparel to mechanically recycle these materials into new textiles of the same value, with the goal of working towards a closed loop system where new products are made from old. WSP Coachtopia has partnered with WSP, one of the world's leading engineering, environment and professional services firms, to create an environ- mental impact calculation tool for Coachtopia. This cradle-to-grave tool calculates both the greenhouse gas emissions of our products and the total weight of waste diverted from landfill to create them. 1% for the planet Coachtopia* is a member of 1% for the Planet, a growing global community of businesses and individuals working together to help protect the earth. As a member, we've pledged to donate 1% of Coachtopia's annual sales to verified environmental non-profit organizations working to create positive change. *partnership with Tapestry, our parent company Good Shipping, 3 Degrees Coachtopia offsets the carbon emissions of its upstream and downstream shipping and freight, including eCommerce shipments to consumers, through two partnerships: Good Shipping, a company that substitutes fossil fuels in ocean freight with sustainable biofuels, a verified carbon neutral fuel option, and 3 Degrees, a company that works with brands to offset emissions through a portfolio of certified carbon emissions reductions projects. Our Impacts Coachtopia is assessing the impacts of its products through a carbon footprint and waste diversion measurement tool developed in partnership with WSP, one of the world's leading engineering, environment and professional services firms. To ensure these impacts are communicated with the utmost transparency, the brand is conducting a critical review of these metrics with three external lifecycle assessment experts\u2014the results of which will be published in mid-2023. Coachtopia has also worked with testing and certification company SGS to conduct full lifecycle assessments of its key styles, the Ergo and the Wavy Dinky, to identify continued opportunities for reducing the impact of its products. Carbon Footprint Carbon Reduction Waste Diversion 10 kgs CO2e created. 71% carbon reduction. 398 gs waste diverted. Coachtopia has worked with WSP to calculate the carbon footprint of each one of its products, with the goal of reducing their overall emissions. By repurposing materials that already exist, this product helps to avoid the creation of new materials\u2014which accounts for 38% of fashion's emissions. Coachtopia also works to reduce its emissions across its full value chain. By upcyling and recycling waste that might otherwise have been sent to landfill, this product helps Coachtopia to work towards a zero-waste future. The Reusable Store Each Coachtopia store environment reflects the brand's Made Circular\u2122 principles, featuring fixtures made with Coach leather production waste, neon signs made from industry scraps and offcuts, hangers and trays made from recycled paper or textiles, seating made from excess materials and unrepairable Coach bags and a flexible modular design that facilitates reuse. Each store environment also reflects Coachtopia's collaborative ethos with bespoke furniture crafted by local artists using upcycled damaged Coach products, excess Coach materials and locally salvaged materials.

However, some see it as a business opportunity ready for innovative solutions. If we properly educate ourselves about food waste, we would see that taking the steps to reduce it can be an excellent way to lower costs, generate profits, and alleviate climate change. Here are 11 effective solutions to tackle food waste for businesses, producers, retailers, and consumers. __ The issue of food waste ranges from industrial to individual; there are many contributing factors towards why food is wasted, such as purchasing preferences, excess production, retail standards, convenience, cost and more. Food waste affects all three realms of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. It is a societal issue that touches everyone around the globe, and it contributes to the larger issue of climate change. It has been estimated that food waste accounts for one-third of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and generates 8% of greenhouse gases annually. Solutions for food waste are needed now more than ever. Everyone can be a part of the solution to food waste, from large corporations to small communities. Innovators have explored food waste solutions in the science and technology industry, but there is still more that needs to be done. Addressing food waste does not need to be a charitable thing or a form of philanthropy. What often goes unrecognised are the huge benefits that can be achieved from reducing food waste, and they are not just environmental. They can differ from improvements in one\u2019s health, to profits generated in a company with innovative solutions to tackle the crisis. If businesses redirect excess food to communities with limited access to it, they can save money and reduce their methane emissions at the same time. Educating the public about the benefits of reducing food waste will also encourage businesses and consumers to monitor their waste more closely. You might also like: What is Food Waste? Creating Circular Food Systems Businesses can benefit in the reduction of food waste economically, socially and on a broader scale, environmentally. Inspired by Patagonia\u2019s sustainability effort, the University of Maine\u2019s Mitchell Center Team Project conducted a research project that looked into \u201cFood Management: Empowering Main Businesses Towards Sustainability\u201d. This study was conducted in collaboration with stakeholders who were persuading business owners to adapt food waste solutions into their practices. The aim of the project was to determine how easily these changes can be adapted to fit the individual lifestyles of consumers. The stakeholders involved work in Maine\u2019s food-related industries, such as grocery stores, farms, restaurants, and hospitals. Key stakeholders included Hannaford, Northern Light: Maine Coast Hospital, City of Portland, and the Maine DEP, as well as many others. In this study, using a triple bottom line approach, businesses were encouraged to equally prioritise their monetary profits with their environmental and social responsibilities. They recommended food systems to be reworked from a linear one into a circular one. In a linear system, there is a simple relationship between production to consumption, in which the end result is waste. However, with a circular economy, the goal is to recycle waste into a resource that can be used to create new products. The study was successful in that stakeholders were interested in collaboration at the end of the project. It also highlighted the importance of education and accessibility to landfill alternatives. Six solutions were developed from the collaboration in the project: 1. Measuring and tracking all food storage Businesses were encouraged to use pre-existing food waste tracking technology. These systems can help make businesses aware of the money they are wasting on food waste that never gets to consumers. 2. Creating a \u201cFood Rescue\u201d system This solution utilised a web-based system that matched locally available food to local food needs and volunteers to transfer the food to the ones that need it. 3. Promoting statewide consumer and producer waste education Consumer education and awareness about the food system and the waste was encouraged. Doing so helped people see the true value of the food they are purchasing. There is a general lack of awareness, so implementing education programmes in schools can be an effective way to educate the public. 4. Building of food handling and processing infrastructure This solution focuses on \u201cupcycling\u201d food that is already in the system, e.g. turning tomatoes into tomato sauce and increasing demand in canning and processing food for long-term storage. The aim here is to connect key members of the food system and create synergy among handling and processing stakeholders. Primary issues to be addressed are transportation availability, storage limitations, and restrictions associated with food donation. 5. Educate producers on the advantages of donating This solution is also related to the second solution. The primary goal for this solution is to educate stakeholders on food donation incentives, legal protection, and offer guidance on relevant governmental agencies. 6. Composting alternatives This solution aims to increase available options for composting and other alternatives to disposal of food in landfills. Developing statewide practices to divert food waste from landfills can make huge cost savings possible. Changing Food Crops The International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) recommends producers and farmers to consider a change in crops. They believe that improving food security and lowering greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through changing what we eat, and growing more sustainable and hardy crops. These types of crops can be ones that are low maintenance, can cope with extreme weather events, and crops that can be interspersed with pastures and arable land. Avoiding deforestation for additional farmland could also prevent more than 70 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions. For other ways to reduce food waste on the producer level, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recommended the following solutions for producers and farmers: 1. On-farm storage On-farm storage is a great way to reduce post-harvest loss. Farmers should have effective, safe and accessible storage for their products. Some countries might offer a farm storage facility loan programme (USDA) where they provide low-interest financing to help producers build or upgrade storage. 2. Value-added products This is where you can enhance the value of products by upcycling them into another product. The potential to reduce food waste can be made if we create value-added products. A good example of this is growing out black solider fly larvae to bioconvert the organic waste into sustainable insect protein, oil and frass which eliminates or abates on farm emissions. 3. Secondary markets that produce delivery services There are many businesses in some countries that offer weekly or bimonthly boxes of food products that have been directly sourced from the farmers. Farmers could directly collaborate with these markets to effectively control their food production. 4. Donations Donations from farmers can help provide individuals with fresh produce if they have limited access to it. There have been laws and programs created to make donations easy \u2014 liability protection, tax benefits, picking and pack-out costs, gleaning etc. 5. Feeding animals Using the food scraps as feed for animals can also be done. This is a common practice that has been around for centuries and is an easy way to divert food waste. However these animals especially cattle \u2013 produce methane. So better ways to recycle the waste need to be deployed, such as insect farming. Redirecting Food Surplus and Educational Campaigns Food waste from restaurants and business constitutes 28% of the food wasted. To rectify this, we can push for policies that limit waste and redirect uneaten food to places where it is needed. This can be in the form of food recovery programmes to direct surplus to shelters. There are other wide varieties of changes retailers can make in order to reduce their food waste. Some of these include upgrading their hardware with the latest technology, focusing on long-term sustainability rather than maximising returns from a product in the short-term, modifying their policies and regulations and ensuring all food is accepted to be sold etc. Supermarkets can also create campaigns, where they provide education, inspiration and advice to their customers. Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 the second largest chain of supermarkets in the UK \u2013 research found that people look to supermarkets for guidance on how to tackle food waste, therefore retailers could provide literature in the form of magazines and membership programmes, that can provide ideas on how customers can prevent food waste, as well as recipes on how to utilise leftover food. A good example is the rising number of \u201cwonky\u201d vegetable initiatives that have been implemented by supermarkets in recent years. These initiatives encourage consumers to buy food that does not meet aesthetic criteria, and they have been marketed in a way to make them appealing. In 2021, it was reported that Tesco\u2019s food waste scheme Perfectly Imperfect saved at least 50 million packs of fruit and vegetables from being discarded. Rethink Our Food Perceptions and Habits Food waste is also the responsibility of us as individuals, as food waste at home can amount to 37% of overall food waste. We need to change our habits in ways that significantly reduce the amount of food that we waste. One of the easiest solutions for food waste is through organisation methods. We could organise our fridge in a way that ensures the food that will go off first is clearly visible to us when we open the fridge. We could keep a list of the food we have bought on hand, and make a note of all the use-by labels. While this can be time consuming, a study in 2020 indicated that if you put these small efforts into reducing food waste, you could end up saving a substantial amount of money. We also need to change our minds and the way we perceive food. Rather than preparing and cooking a meal we are in the mood for, we should base our cooking decisions off of the food we see in the fridge that needs to be used first. Researching literature or buying cookbooks that provide ideas on how to utilise food scraps and leftover food can also be beneficial. Additionally, composting your food waste can help reduce carbon by equivalent of 12 million passenger vehicles off the road for 30 years. Changes to our diet also need to be made. Experts have stated that there is too much fish, fats, sugars, dairy products and processed foods in our diets. Aside from incorporating more fruit and vegetables in our diets, Dr. Debra Roberts, co-chair of IPCC Working Group II, has recommended that we change our diet to consist primarily of low-CO2 emission food. By doing so, we can ensure that we maintain a balanced diet based on foods such as secondary cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, and even animal foods obtained with low CO2 emissions. We can do this by making conscious decisions to eat food that has a low carbon footprint such as plant-based foods. Meal-prepping is another great way to save time and resources, which can also prevent you from overbuying during food shopping. You might also like: 25 Shocking Facts About Food Waste 6 Key Facts to Help Consumers Make More Conscious Choices Most foods are labelled in supermarkets and retailers, and understanding what these labels mean can help you organise your food shopping. 1. \u201cSell by\u201d date This is the date the retailer should display the product until withdrawing it from the shelves. This date does not indicate that the food has spoiled, but merely specifies the day that it will be past its best quality. The food is still safe to consume. 2. \u201cBest if used by (or before)\u201d date This date is for sellers and indicates when the food will be at its best quality to eat. It does not mean the food is inedible after this date, but merely informs the customer of when the best time to consume the food will be for it\u2019s flavour and freshness etc. 3. \u201cGuaranteed fresh\u201d date This date refers to the date when the item is at its optimal freshness. This is usually used for bakery items. 4. \u201cPack date\u201d This is usually the date on canned or packaged food. This date tells us when the product was packed. It does not indicate when it needs to be consumed by. 5. \u201cUse By\u201d date This is the last date that the manufacturer guarantees the product to be at its maximum quality. 6. \u201cExpires on\u201d date This date refers to the date that it is recommended that the product should be consumed by. If you decide to eat the food after the date, it is at your own risk. Overall, knowing the meaning of these dates is useful. However, it should be noted that some manufacturers might not put them on their products. For example, if you go to a meat market or a fish market, you may receive products in an ordinary bag, without a label. Here is a basic guide for when food is safe to eat: Milk \u2013 usually safe after one week after selling Eggs \u2013 often fine from three \u2013 five weeks from the date of purchase \u2013 often fine from three \u2013 five weeks from the date of purchase Poultry and seafood \u2013 cook or freeze within one or two days after purchase \u2013 cook or freeze within one or two days after purchase Beef or pork \u2013 cook or freeze within three-five days \u2013 cook or freeze within three-five days Canned goods \u2013 five-18 months, depending on the acidity of the product Benefits of Reducing Food Waste at Home Even though you will be making a conscious effort to help the environment, you will also be receiving benefits from reducing your food waste: Money saved by planning what to buy properly Maintaining a healthy weight and preventing overeating Lessening the chances of food poisoning in your household, as storing contaminated food could accidentally be consumed without you realising A well-organised, fresh-smelling pantry. There will be no bad smell or messy food waste around your pantry Pest control You can keep away pests, such as rats, flies and cockroaches Earth.Org believes that there is a gargantuan opportunity to recycle organic waste and believes companies like FlyFarm, Ynsect and Innovafeed are showing that insect bioconversion eliminates emissions at the same time as produces high value sustainable protein. Challenges remain for post consumer waste around waste segregation and incentives for consumers to ensure their waste is free of contaminants. Governments should focus on ensuring that organic waste can be recycled. Featured image by Marco Verch\/Flickr","filter_flag":1}

Climate Change and Environment Society Food and Natural Resources \u00a9 Daniel Funes Fuentes Bio-based and organic is the same. It\u2019s a myth. Bio-based and organic are not the same. The prefix \u201cbio\u201d means \u201clife\u201d or \u201cliving organisms\u201d. It is generally used to indicate biological or natural materials as opposed to synthetic raw materials such as crude oil or natural gas. Instead, the term bio-based refers to the type of raw material used to manufacture a product, and it does not relate to the materials produced. Which means that if a product is bio-based, it is partly or wholly made from biomass, i.e. renewable materials of plant or animal origin. Being labelled as \u201cBio-based\u201d however, says nothing about how such feedstock has been produced (for example, how plants have been cultivated). To indicate resource-saving and environmentally friendly way of producing resources, the term \u201corganic\u201d is mainly used instead. This particularly applies to the food sector and in agriculture. Not every bio-based product is organic. It\u2019s a fact. A product can be \u201cbio-based\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d, but it does not have to be. Bio-based simply describes the fact that a product or material is of plant or animal origin. \u201cOrganic\u201d means that the cultivation of the plants or the keeping of the animals complies with requirements of the European organic farming standard. Bio-based is always (per definition) more environmentally friendly. It\u2019s a myth. Bio-based products are not automatically more sustainable than fossil-based products. When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and fossil resource consumption, bio-based materials usually perform better than fossil-based ones. Conversely, they mostly do worse in the acidification and eutrophication categories. In addition, factors such as environmental damage from oil drilling or disruption of the ecosystems in mining areas contribute to increasing the environmental impact of oil-based resources. Bio-based means a product is always biodegradable. It\u2019s a myth. Biodegradability is often discussed for plastics, but not all bio-based plastics and products are biodegradable. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to water and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) or also new biomass. There is no official definition of biodegradable, in contrast to the term compostable. Since everything eventually biodegrades, even if it takes thousands of years, the claim biodegradable should always come with an explanation of the surrounding environmental conditions (the environmental medium and temperature) under which a product or material biodegrades. Details about different biodegradable and durable bio-based materials can be found in this facts- or-myth post on biodegradability. Biodegradable and compostable are the same. It\u2019s a myth. This one is a bit tricky. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms. There is no official definition of biodegradable, in contrast to the term compostable. Composting is the organic recycling process in which organic waste is broken down by microbial digestion to create compost. This means composting is one kind of biodegradation in a specific environment. To go through a composting process, organic waste requires the right level of heat, water and oxygen. When talking about composting of bio-based materials it usually refers to industrial composting. Industrial composting facilities meet the requirements of a controlled environment and high temperatures. Standards (e.g. EN 13432 ) for industrial composting define what conditions a product needs to meet to be called \u201ccompostable\u201d, such as disintegration in a defined time, no harmful substances or ecotoxicity. In home composting temperatures are lower and the environment is not controlled. Consequently, the process also works slower under home composting conditions.

The world\u2019s biggest industries have pumped more and more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and the consequences are becoming difficult to ignore. Last year was fraught with extreme weather events, like heatwaves and devastating floods, and this year, more is coming. In fact, early forecasts suggest that a combination of El Ni\u00f1o and the climate crisis could see temperatures exceed 1.5C of warming this year. The prediction is alarming. But, when it comes to climate crisis mitigation, we\u2019re not totally powerless. As individuals, there are some actions we can take to reduce our own environmental impact. In 2018, the world\u2019s biggest food production analysis, conducted at the University of Oxford, concluded that rejecting resource-intensive and pollutive animal agriculture, and adopting a plant-based diet, was the best way a person could reduce their own carbon footprint. \u201cA vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use, and water use,\u201d said lead author Joseph Poore at the time. Unsplash But when it comes to climate action, the truth is, the problem is far bigger than individuals. And that means the solution needs to come from higher up. We are, of course, talking about governmental action. There is a long way to go before many countries, particularly those in the West (who are responsible for most of the world\u2019s emissions), can say they have truly done their part to limit emissions and tackle the climate crisis. But, by pushing plant-based food consumption and supporting alternative protein development, some governments (at a local, state, and central level) have started to take important steps\u2014here are eight examples. 1 Germany At the end of 2022, Germany\u2019s federal minister of food and agriculture Cem \u00d6zdemir proposed Germany\u2019s new National Nutrition Strategy in a paper titled \u201cTowards the Federal Government\u2019s Nutrition Strategy.\u201d The paper acknowledged that the country\u2019s meat consumption was far too high, both from a nutrition and sustainability standpoint. In 2021, Statista notes that German people ate 55kg of meat per capita\u2014lower than in previous years, but still a significant amount.) \u201cHow and what we eat also has far-reaching effects: on the environment, biodiversity, and climate in Germany and worldwide, on animals as our fellow beings, on the agricultural and food industry, and not ultimately on our health and well-being,\u201d the paper noted. It also lays out several goals, including the whole country going carbon neutral by 2045 and ensuring that 30 percent of agricultural goods come from organic farming by 2030, as well as halving food waste in every sector. It noted that to meet these goals, food strategies must embrace seasonal, local, plant-based produce. \u201cThe transformation of the entire food system towards a plant-based diet is the most important adjusting screw in the nutrition sector to achieve our national and international climate, biodiversity, and sustainability goals,\u201d the paper continued. Unsplash 2 The US Across the US, several states and major cities have embraced a more plant-forward approach to food. In New York City, for example, public schools launched Vegan Fridays last year. The initiative means that every Friday, 930,000 children are served plant-based meals. And in March 2022, the city, which has its own vegan mayor, Eric Adams, joined 40 states and cities, including Colorado, by declaring March 20 \u201cMeatOut Day.\u201d The initiative was created by the Farm Animal Rights Movement in a bid to educate more people about the benefits of plant-based diets. On the West Coast, California has also been pushing plant-based diets. In July 2022, it became the first state to support plant-based school meals with a $700 million investment. \u201cWe are grateful to see both the legislature and the Governor recognize the cultural shift towards plant-based choices by supporting our children to eat healthier, more climate-friendly, and humane diets,\u201d said Judie Mancuso, founder of animal advocacy nonprofit Social Compassion in Legislation, at the time. Elsewhere in the US, new legislation in Illinois, set to go into force this year, means that nearly 2 million children have access to plant-based school lunches. And in May 2022, Washington, DC celebrated its first vegan restaurant week thanks to a proclamation signed by Mayor Murial Bowser. \u201cWhereas plant-centric eating lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and those conditions disproportionally undermine the health-related quality of life of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) residents of Washington, DC and whereas a global shift toward plant-centric food norms would help lower greenhouse gas emissions, and governments can play a crucial trailblazing role in facilitating such shifts by their citizenry,\u201d Bowser said at the time. 3 Canada In the four years leading up to December 2022, Protein Industries Canada\u2014which has received funding from the Government of Canada and is one of the country\u2019s five Global Innovation Clusters\u2014invested more than $477 million into Canada\u2019s plant-based food sector. \u201cWe now have projects that span from British Columbia to Prince Edward Island and beyond,\u201d Bill Greuel, the CEO of Protein Industries Canada, said. \u201cMore so, the result of this investment is becoming increasingly tangible, with new ingredients and food products making their way onto grocery shelves and restaurant menus in Canada and beyond.\u201d Also in 2022, the government\u2019s AgriInnovate Program awarded plant-based brand Big Mountain Foods 2 Ltd. more than $1.4 million in funding. 4 Denmark In 2021, the Danish government announced it would be dedicating more than 1.25 billion kroner (around $183 million) to the advancement of the plant-based food sector. The funding was agreed as part of an \u201cunprecedented climate agreement for food and agriculture,\u201d reported the Good Food Institute (GFI) Europe. \u201cWith this announcement, Denmark has recognized the huge potential of sustainable proteins to drive down agricultural emissions, and established itself as Europe\u2019s biggest public investor in plant-based innovation,\u201d Acacia Smith, GFI Europe\u2019s policy manager, said at the time. In 2022, Denmark followed up this agreement by investing more than $100 million into its \u201cPlant Fund.\u201d 5Taiwan In January 2023, a new climate bill, which specifically references the promotion of plant-based, low-carbon diets, passed the legislature in Taiwan. The bill, called the Climate Change Response Act, also enshrines the country\u2019s 2050 net zero targets into law. The move was praised by the Environment & Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST), which has campaigned consistently for an update to Taiwan\u2019s laws regarding the role of food in the climate crisis. \u201cAs the world comes to grips with the importance of food systems in addressing climate change, we are delighted to see an emphasis on low-carbon diets in Taiwan\u2019s climate legislation,\u201d Wu Hung, EAST\u2019s Chief Executive, said. @punehealthsave 6 India In 2021, a grassroots campaign called The Plant Based Treaty launched for the first time. Designed to accompany the Paris Agreement, the treaty aims to \u201cput food systems at the heart of combatting the climate crisis.\u201d So far, thousands of individuals have endorsed the treaty, as well as 20 cities around the world. While Boynton Beach, FL; Los Angeles, CA; Didim, Turkey; Haywards Heath, England; and Edinburgh, Scotland are among the endorsers, most (15) of the cities and towns on the list are located in India. Gopalpur, a coastal town in Odisha, was the most recent Indian town to endorse the treaty. \u201cWe completely agree with the motto \u2018eat plants, plant trees,\u2019\u201d Gopalpur\u2019s council said in a message regarding its endorsement. \u201cWe believe that shifting towards a plant-based diet can solve the climate crisis.\u201d 7 The Netherlands In 2019, Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, announced that meat would no longer be automatically available at government-catered events, starting in 2020. Instead, all menus are vegetarian by default. \u201cThe initiative makes it the individual\u2019s choice of whether to have meat or fish,\u201d Rutger Groot Wassink, the head of operational management, said at the time. \u201cWe are turning the norms upside down. The question is no longer, \u2018Are you vegetarian?\u2019 but \u2018Do you eat meat or fish?\u2019\u201d In 2021, Amsterdam City Council also revealed plans to persuade citizens to go 50-percent plant-based by 2030, and 60-percent plant-based by 2040. Plus in 2022, the central government of the Netherlands showed its support for alternative protein when it allocated \u20ac60 Million for the cultivated meat industry (cultivated meat refers to growing meat from cells in laboratories, so it isn\u2019t plant-based, but it is slaughter-free). 8 Finland In 2020, the Finnish government invested $2.4 million into the country\u2019s plant-based meat sector. And, in December 2022, it was revealed that the funding is paying off. The VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which is owned by the state, announced that it had developed a new innovative technology that would help to perfect plant-based meat products. Essentially, it combines cellular agriculture techniques with plant-based ingredients, and the result tastes just like animal meat. \u201cOur innovation toolkit allows producers to perfectly recreate the sizzling fat and juicy tenderness of meat like never before,\u201d Nesli S\u00f6zer, Research Professor at VTT, said. \u201cBy combining our experience in plant-based ingredients, food design, and cellular agriculture, we can create proof-of-concept of prototypes for tasty, identical meat alternatives that are ready to be scaled up for industrial production.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

On the surface, the latest addition to ExxonMobil\u2019s giant petrochemical refinery complex in Baytown, Texas, sounds like it could be a good thing: An \u201cadvanced recycling\u201d facility capable of breaking down 36,000 metric tons of hard-to-recycle plastic each year. But plastic waste advocates warn that plants like it do little actual recycling, and instead generate hazardous pollutants while providing cover for oil giants to keep producing millions of tons of new plastic products each year. The facility, which began large-scale operations in December of last year, is one of the largest chemical recycling plants in North America. Chemical recycling works by breaking down plastic polymers into small molecules in order to make new plastics, synthetic fuels and other products. Companies like ExxonMobil have rebranded the technology as \u201cadvanced recycling\u201d and are now touting it as the latest hi-tech fix to address the plastic crisis, as traditional, mechanical recycling has failed to slow the tide of plastic piling up in landfills and the ocean. ExxonMobil also says it\u2019s planning to build chemical recycling plants at \u201cmany of its other manufacturing sites around the world\u201d. Though it hasn\u2019t committed specific dollar amounts to building new plants, the company is currently assessing locations in Louisiana, Illinois, Belgium, Singapore and elsewhere. By the end of 2026, the oil giant hopes to have enough chemical recycling capacity to process roughly 450,000 metric tons of plastic each year. But that\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared with how much plastic ExxonMobil creates. In 2021 alone, ExxonMobil churned out 6m tons of new single-use plastic, more than any other petrochemical company, according to a recent report by the philanthropic Minderoo Foundation. What\u2019s more, recent research has shown that chemical recycling is worse for the environment than mechanical recycling in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and water use, and in some cases, worse than virgin plastic production. The process ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown plant uses, called pyrolysis, is often so inefficient that many environmental advocates say it should not be called recycling at all. View image in fullscreen Smoke fills the air at the refinery in Baytown, Texas, in 2021. In that year alone, ExxonMobil churned out 6m tons of new single-use plastic Photograph: Mark Mulligan\/AP Conventional mechanical recycling involves sorting different types of plastic into individual streams that are washed, shredded and melted down to make new products. During this process, the chemical makeup of the plastic remains unchanged, although contaminants can find their way in during the melting and cutting process and the end products have a weaker physical structure. Chemical recycling relies on high heat, pressure or chemical catalysts like enzymes to break down plastic into its molecular building blocks. Those building blocks can then be used to make new products \u2013 including new plastics with the same physical structure as the original material. The most commercially widespread chemical recycling technology today is pyrolysis, according to Taylor Uekert, a scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory who studies plastic recycling. Pyrolysis has significant environmental impacts. Plants that use it require large amounts of energy to operate: Uekert found that recycling a kilogram of high-density polyethylene plastic using pyrolysis requires nearly seven times the amount of energy needed to make a kilogram of virgin plastic. Typically, that energy comes from burning fossil fuels, which creates air pollution and planet-heating carbon emissions. Pyrolysis operations can also consume large volumes of water, and they often generate hazardous waste. Overall, Uekert\u2019s research found that the environmental impact of making recycled plastics with pyrolysis is 10 to 100 times greater than virgin plastic production. In a pyrolysis plant, plastic is put in a reactor and subjected to high temperatures (ranging from 300 to 900C) and pressures in the absence of oxygen. This treatment transforms plastic into a synthetic form of crude oil which can be used as a replacement for fossil fuels or to create new plastics. While pyrolysis is able to handle more types of plastic waste than some other chemical recycling technologies, Uekert said it is not typically considered \u201cclosed loop\u201d recycling because the fuel it generates is often burned for energy \u2013 meaning it can\u2019t be recycled again and again. Although pyrolysis is not the same as incineration, in which waste is burned in the presence of oxygen, environmental advocates often liken pyrolysis to incineration since the end products tend to go up in smoke one way or the other. Chemical recycling \u201cis a way for the industry to continue to expand its plastic production and assuage people\u2019s concerns about plastic waste\u201d, said Veena Singla, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council who has analyzed chemical recycling facilities around the US. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to put a pretty bow on it.\u201d ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown recycling plant uses the firm\u2019s proprietary \u201cExxtend\u201d technology, a pyrolysis-based approach, according to company statements. Reached for comment, an ExxonMobil spokesperson, Julie King, told the Guardian that this process \u201ccomplements traditional mechanical recycling\u201d by turning hard-to-recycle plastics into raw materials which can be used to make new plastics for food packaging, medical equipment and personal hygiene products. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She also did not confirm the exact name or location of the plant: when asked for any identifying information that could be used to look up its state and federal permits, King simply said that ExxonMobil reports emissions to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the state of Texas in a \u201cconsistent and timely manner in accordance with all laws, regulations and permits\u201d. King also offered that a third-party analysis by the environmental consulting firm Sphera found that every ton of plastic waste fed through ExxonMobil\u2019s chemical recycling process generates 19 to 49% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than processing the same amount of crude-based feedstocks. (ExxonMobil did not share a copy of a report, and Sphera didn\u2019t answer emails.) She also declined to say how much of the plastic waste fed into the plant would be used to make recycled plastic versus synthetic fuel. An internal analysis shared with the Guardian by the Minderoo Foundation found that if ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown plant had yields typical of pyrolysis plants, only 23% of the fuel it generates would be used to produce new plastics. The rest would go to other non-plastic applications, like fuel for transportation. Chemical recycling is \u201cdeflecting attention away from what we need, which is reducing single-use plastics and a global treaty on plastic waste\u201d, said Phaedra Pezzullo, a professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder who has a book forthcoming on plastics and environmental justice. In an undercover investigation in 2021, Unearthed caught the ExxonMobil lobbyist Keith McCoy on video explaining how the firm uses recycling \u2013 including the Baytown plant \u2013 to shift the conversation around how to deal with plastic away from reducing consumption. (ExxonMobil\u2019s CEO, Darren Woods, later said that McCoy\u2019s comments \u201cin no way represent the company\u2019s position on a variety of issues\u201d, and the oil company has since parted ways with McCoy.) As the petrochemical industry forges ahead with chemical recycling, the same low-income communities and communities of color that bear the burden of plastic manufacturing are seeing these plants pop up in their backyards. Of the eight chemical recycling facilities operating in the US in 2021, six are located in disproportionately Black and brown communities, according to a report by Singla. Five are in areas with a large number of households living on less than $25,000 a year. View image in fullscreen The refinery in Baytown, Texas.

Photograph: Mark Mulligan\/AP The Baytown plant wasn\u2019t included in Singla\u2019s analysis, which only included facilities for which data had been reported to the EPA or state permits were available as of August 2021. But the city, already a hub of petrochemical production, fits the pattern she identified: nearly 20% of its predominantly white, working-class residents live in poverty, with a per-capita income of just $25,000. ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown complex \u2013 which includes the third largest oil refinery in the US and a plant that manufactures 2.3m metric tons of plastic a year \u2013 is a major contributor to regional air and water pollution. It also has a long history of emitting chemicals above its permit limits, including the carcinogenic compound benzene. In recent years, ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown complex has been the site of fires and explosions that have injured workers and triggered shelter-in-place orders for nearby residents. \u201cExxon has a terrible track record of polluting the Baytown community,\u201d Luke Metzger, the executive director of Environment Texas, told the Guardian. \u201cThis false \u2018chemical recycling\u2019 will only produce more toxic misery for Baytown.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

There are dozens of smokestacks in every direction of the plant, which churns out not only gasoline and jet fuel, but propane and other materials, on a site that's larger than downtown Edmonton. Grey and brown steel pipes snake from one building to another and back again, like a spaghetti buffet. About 50 different tanks hold a variety of oils, fuels and gases. At a glance, it's not the kind of facility people might imagine as part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. But it is. The refinery is one of five in the world that Shell has selected globally to transform into a low-carbon energy production facility, which the company says it intends to keep operating for decades to come, even as it aims to reach a 2050 goal of net-zero emissions. \"It's the ambition to be here for many decades to come,\" said Mark Pattenden, a senior vice-president with Shell Canada, during an interview at the Scotford facility. The Scotford facility employs 1,500 workers, 500 long-term contractors, and thousands of short-term contractors. (Kyle Bakx\/CBC) 'Top of the policy agenda' Achieving those climate targets \u2014 now less than three decades away \u2014 while operating such a massive refining operation may seem far-fetched, but the company has begun to take steps toward transforming the facility. It's a common dilemma facing many companies throughout Canada's industrial sector: finding ways to future-proof their business amid increasing concerns about the environment and the harmful effects of climate change around the globe. \"As the pandemic recedes, climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy will move to the top of the policy agenda,\" said the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters in a report , noting the transition will be difficult, but has the potential to be rewarding as \"global demand for clean technology is increasing at an explosive rate.\" WATCH | Coast-to-coast clean energy in the federal budget: Federal budget includes plan for clean energy grid Duration 1:43 This week\u2019s federal budget revealed the Liberal Party's plans to provide clean energy from coast to coast. But making that a reality will be a massive undertaking, logistically and politically. Canadian companies are taking different approaches in the face of environmental pressure. Oilsands companies in Alberta are proposing to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 largely through using carbon capture and storage facilities. Last year, Suncor Energy sold its wind and solar business, but wants to expand its biofuel and hydrogen production. Meanwhile, pipeline firm Enbridge is expanding the number of its renewable energy projects including offshore wind, while TC Energy is developing projects like pumped-hydro electricity storage A hydrogen production facility is shown at Shell's Scotford complex. This plant uses water and natural gas to produce hydrogen that is used at the nearby oil refinery. Shell's proposed Polaris project would capture the majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from this hydrogen facility and store the gases in an underground reservoir. (Kyle Bakx\/CBC) Shell's Scotford facility was first built in 1984 as a refinery, and later expanded to add an upgrader to process oilsands bitumen into different types of crude oil. The two plants work together to produce gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, in addition to some gasses such as propane and butane. A petrochemical plant on the site pumps out styrene monomer and ethylene glycol, used in products like food containers, home insulation and antifreeze. The refinery, upgrader and petrochemical plants are all connected, and that level of integration is part of the reason why Scotford was one of the handful of refineries around the world that Shell wants to keep, the company told CBC News. It's also one of its most profitable, they added. Changes underway There is a general plan for Scotford to be re-invented by cutting down on pollution and by producing new types of low-carbon products. There is a specific roadmap to reduce emissions, although company officials are more vague about diversifying its product mix. The first step in cutting emissions came in 2015, when the Quest carbon capture and storage began operating. Annually, it collects about one million tonnes of emissions and pumps the gases into a reservoir several kilometres underground. Recently, a five megawatt solar field was built on site, and Shell has signed a long-term deal to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity from a newly-built nearby wind farm. Construction of a second solar field is underway, officials say, which will produce about 58 megawatts of electricity. Combined, executives say the three projects are expected to cut the amount of pollution produced to power the entire Scotford facility in half. A five megawatt solar field is located near Shell's petrochemical plant. (Kyle Bakx\/CBC) Within the next year, officials say the company will make a final decision on whether to proceed with the Polaris carbon capture and storage project, which would be much larger than the existing Quest facility. For now, the company continues developing the project, such as the detailed designs. The carbon capture projects help cut down on pollution, but considering the size of the facility, they will only put a dent into overall emissions. For now, the Scotford facility will continue to focus on producing oil, fuels and chemicals as there are no specific plans to change the formula. However, Pattenden said the company is exploring whether to branch out into producing other types of low-carbon energy like biofuels, hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel. \"They're all in play and they're all things that we're going to be considering,\" said Pattenden. \"There's going to be other opportunities we're going to develop.\" Climate concerns Last month, scientists delivered a \"final warning\" on the climate crisis, calling for immediate action as rising greenhouse gas emissions push the world to the brink of irrevocable damage. At the same time, consumption of oil and gas continues to rise around the globe every year. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there has been an increased focus on energy security and affordability. Previously, Shell has sold refineries in different parts of the world and much of its Alberta oilsands operations, in part, to reduce its emissions. While Shell's divestments help the company reach its climate goals, the facilities are still in operation, just under a different ownership. While some environmental groups want the oilpatch to stop fossil fuel development altogether, others are a bit more nuanced. The world is beginning to move through an energy transition, experts say, as there is a shift from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of fuel and power. For a company to achieve a net-zero emission target, there is no specific game plan to follow as it can be a complex goal to achieve, said Jan Gorski with the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank. Generally, oilpatch producers should invest money toward reducing emissions from existing operations while also diversifying their business \u2014 such as expanding into renewable energy and hydrogen production, he said. To determine whether companies could be greenwashing or are earnest in their efforts, Gorski said, he looks at the size of a company's investments. Crude oil is refined into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane and butane at the Scotford complex. (Kyle Bakx\/CBC) \"The key thing to look at is how are they using their money? How are they investing their capital? What percentage of their capital is going toward reducing emissions? What per cent is going toward diversification?\" said Gorski. \"I don't have any hard and fast rules for what's good and what a company should be striving for, but those are the kind of metrics to look at.\" Despite the industry's record profits last year, only about five per cent of worldwide investment by the oilpatch went to wind, solar and other renewable energies in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency , up from one per cent in 2019. Last year, Shell invested about $3.5 billion globally on its renewables and energy-solutions business, which includes a variety of technologies from wind and solar farms, to carbon offsets, carbon capture and biofuels. The level of spending made up about 14 per cent of total capital expenditures last year and executives have said that level of spending will remain steady in 2023. At Scotford, the refinery, upgrader and petrochemicals plant will remain the centrepieces of the facility, even as renewable energy and other additions are made. How quickly Shell offers new products at the site, like biofuels, will depend on demand from their customers, executives say. \"This is how we will move through the energy transition,\" said Pattenden. \"Affordable energy, available energy, but also a decarbonised energy are all going to be really important aspects.\"","filter_flag":1}

It is also known as one of the world\u2019s top meat producing and consuming countries in the world. The South American country is home to JBS Foods, which has consistently been named as one of the worst polluters with links to illegal deforestation, destruction of wildlife habitats, and recurring corruption. Last month, World Animal Protection released its \u201cFactory Farming Climate Culprits Scorecard\u201d in which JBS ranks the highest in terms of greenhouse gas emissions among the five factory farming giants the animal-rights group analyzed. \u201cJBS is responsible for unspeakable cruelty and the slaughter of billions of thinking, feeling animals each year and is the worst contributor of factory farming greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Lindsay Oliver, Executive Director, World Animal Protection US, said in a statement. \u201cThe company is no stranger to other horrific practices including\u2014false advertising, illegal child labor and labor rights violations, deforestation, and financial bribery.\u201d JBS might be the top polluter but many other animal agriculture companies are contributing to the destruction of the environment and Brazil-based Future Farm is dead set on doing something about it. Future Farm \u201cThe Amazon Forest is right in our backyard,\u201d Alexandre Ruberti, CEO of Future Farms US and former Red Bull executive, tells VegNews. \u201cWe know firsthand how important it is to protect the environment and create a world where people choose to eat more plants, not animals. So, it\u2019s our mission to change the way the world eats.\u201d Building the farm of the future with vegan food Founded in 2019 by Brazilian entrepreneur Marcos Leta and business partner Alfredo Strechinsky, Future Farm\u2019s mission is encapsulated in its name: to create the farm of the future, where craveable, plant-based products replace the cruel and unstainable animal-derived counterparts of the past. \u201cThe farm of the future is one that is environmentally conscious, without sacrificing taste and texture,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cWe know that we can\u2019t keep eating the way we\u2019re eating as a planet to sustain human needs and agriculture.\u201d The company first tackled beef with the launch of its hero product Future Burger, followed by its Future Meatball, Future Beef, and Future Sausage\u2014all of which expanded to the United States in 2021. Future Farm Future Farms\u2019 products are made from non-GMO plant ingredients, including its \u201c3-plant protein,\u201d a blend of pea, soy, and chickpea flour. Together with its proprietary technologies, the plant-based meats are made to compete with animals on every level. The food technology company has its own manufacturing facility, making it agile in product development, whether for its own line or through partnerships. This year, Future Farm is tackling new categories with the launch of Future Chik\u2019n and shelf-stable Future Tuna. Ultimately, it is working on 12 new vegan staples, including honey, milk, hot dogs, and more, to support a transition to a plant-based food system. \u201cAs we continue to move forward into the farm of the future, we have to look at consumer demand and respond to that with our offerings,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to be the one-stop shop for consumers for all things they could find on a farm.\u201d Future Farm As it continues to grow, Future Farm aims to push the needle forward for plant-based alternatives to take up space alongside animal products, the way that sports drinks cut into the soda category or how electric vehicles moved in on combustion cars. \u201cWhile it took time and consumer education, both sides are now in the market and sharing the space when they once weren\u2019t,\u201d Ruberti says. The future of burgers While Future Farm has its sights set on delivering new vegan products in many categories, it is also continuing to improve some of its core products as consumer habits continue to evolve. Future Farm And its flagship Future Burger just got a 4.0 makeover. \u201cWe know that consumer needs are ever-changing, so as future thinkers, we\u2019re thinking about our products differently,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cNutrition is at the forefront, and we\u2019re constantly innovating to make improvements.\u201d The new Future Burger is lower in fat and sodium and features an improved texture and flavor thanks to its proprietary technology which Ruberti says is its \u201csecret sauce.\u201d The company is also working to bring down the price of its plant-based products so that they can truly compete with their animal counterparts. \u201cThe category price in comparison to meat has been a challenge, but with new technology and scale, Future Farm will be able to close the gap between animal and plant-based protein in the near future,\u201d Ruberti says. What\u2019s JBS doing to stay competitive when consumers increasingly demand more sustainable proteins? Short answer: nothing. Earlier this year, The National Advertising Division of BBB National Programs ordered JBS to pull its claims of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 as it found that the meat giant had not implemented any plans to do so. On the flipside, Future Farm\u2019s burger is already miles ahead. Future Farm \u201cPlant-based proteins can be delicious and tasty while also being environmentally friendly and nutritious,\u201d Ruberti says. \u201cIn fact, our Future Burger is 100-percent carbon neutral. We\u2019ve partnered with ClimatePartner to offset our carbon footprint by planting trees in the Amazon. Brazil will always inform how we operate as a company.\u201d Since its launch, Future Farm has expanded its distribution to 30 countries and with an entire farm of vegan staples in the works, the company is not quitting anytime soon. \u201cThe farm of the future is one where taste and quality don\u2019t have to be sacrificed for sustainability,\u201d Ruberti says.","filter_flag":1}

TED\u2019s Audacious Project, a collaborative funding effort designed to help solve grand-scale social impact challenges, will award the $70 million toward \u201cEngineering the Microbiome with CRISPR to Improve our Climate and Health.\u201d Doudna and Jill Banfield, PhD, both of the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, are leading the initiative. It was Banfield who first introduced Doudna to the CRISPR field in bacteria at UC Berkeley\u2019s Free Speech Movement Caf\u00e9 in 2006. Banfield pioneered the field of community sequencing or metagenomics, while Doudna shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with her former collaborator, Emmanuelle Charpentier, PhD. Doudna and Banfield have led a research group that has developed a method of adding or modifying genes within a community of many different species simultaneously, enabling \u201ccommunity editing\u201d of microbes\u2014a technology capable of both editing and tracking edited microbes within a natural community, such as in the gut. The group detailed how they precisely edited genes directly within complex microbiomes, including model systems that replicated natural soil and infant gut microbiomes, in \u201cSpecies- and site-specific genome editing in complex bacterial communities,\u201d a paper published in January 2022 in Nature Microbiology. Now, Doudna\u2019s focus on CRISPR and Banfield\u2019s on microbial communities are being combined through the research effort, which aims to apply precision genome editing to microbiomes. The researchers aim to develop a precision microbiome editing platform, and create a new class of products capable of treating and preventing human diseases, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe need to understand microbiomes and there\u2019s a huge knowledge gap even in the simplest microbiomes, such as those that are associated with the human infant and infant calf. We really just don\u2019t understand how they work,\u201d Banfield told GEN Edge. \u201cThe power that we are pursuing is to use the editing tools to manipulate organisms in the context of microbial communities, to begin to explore in some detail how organisms interact with each other and how they\u2019re interdependent.\u201d That approach, she explained, differs from the historic approach to studying microbes growing by themselves, based on pure culture research. \u201cOur first stage is to begin to explore what functions microbes possess and how they play out. We can do that by using CRISPR-Cas to edit organisms that have not been brought into pure culture,\u201d Banfield continued. \u201cWith those tools, we can provide a roadmap or a hypothesis that can be explored in the laboratory, in microbial communities prior to being deployed in actual real-life circumstances.\u201d Targeting childhood asthma The IGI\u2014whose priorities include advancing genome engineering to cure disease and advancing food security\u2014will collaborate with two other UC campuses, UC San Francisco (UCSF) and UC Davis. At all three sites, researchers have identified several health challenges they will work on during the seven years of the research initiative. One challenge is studying whether an inflammatory compound identified by Susan Lynch, PhD, director of the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine at UCSF, might be an effective target for treating asthma in children. The compound is produced by gut bacteria in children who develop asthma, and past research by Lynch and colleagues has pinpointed which bacteria produce the greatest concentration of the compound. Researchers will carry out an extensive analysis of fecal samples collected from children up to two years old to study more potential targets. The research has the potential to be applied beyond asthma, Brad Ringeisen, PhD, IGI\u2019s executive director, told GEN Edge. \u201cOur approach might be based on the molecule that she\u2019s looked at, and that specific gene and that specific microbe. But it might also be much more expansive. We\u2019re really trying to expand to almost any disease of inflammation,\u201d Ringeisen said. \u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on ways to try to reduce that inflammatory response, which should then reduce the likelihood of developing asthma. But I think it has applications to other diseases of inflammation\u2014things like cardiovascular disease, that are known to be associated with inflammatory markers in the circulatory system as well,\u201d Ringeisen said. \u201cIt starts with the characterization of the fecal samples, and then we\u2019ll be able to start going to mice studies, and then ultimately to humans.\u201d Between the fecal sample characterization and mice studies, Banfield emphasized, the microbial communities will be grown in the lab and tested there. \u201cOne of the three pillars of the initiative is to be able to cultivate realistic human and calf microbiomes in the laboratory, such that they\u2019re stable and representative,\u201d Banfield said. \u201cAnd then, we can test the editing tools in the context of those communities and also test the consequences of the edits, so we know how the system works in greater resolution before transitioning into organoids, in mice, and ultimately humans or animals.\u201d Researchers are hoping to expand their studies into calves by year four, then move beyond. If researchers succeed in finding targets, Ringeisen said, \u201cwe\u2019re planning to try to start a human trial in year six or year seven.\u201d Metagenomics and CRISPR \u201cYou can think of the metagenomics component almost as providing a blueprint or a roadmap, and then the CRISPR toolkit being the laser targeted device that\u2019s able to go in and alter either a specific microbe or a specific gene in the microbe,\u201d Ringeisen said. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t work without the other. You need both of them combined.\u201d Another key area of focus for the researchers will be addressing climate change, specifically curbing greenhouse gas emissions from microbiomes. Microbes from livestock, agricultural soils, and landfills emit methane and nitrous oxide\u2014while microbes in the gut are the source of cow burps commonly held as a major source of methane. Microbes are also the source of methane emissions from landfills, waste lagoons, and rice paddies. Over half of human-driven methane emissions are microbial in origin, and the tools needed to deal with problematic microbes at a global scale are lacking or limited: Antibiotics kill both beneficial and harmful bacteria. Probiotics have only shown a limited impact. Fecal transplants have raised concerns over safety and acceptance, though they have shown some promise in specific areas. Researchers reason, therefore, that animal agriculture is key to addressing greenhouse gas emissions, 15% of which come from livestock, making them a key toward a solution. UC Davis researchers Matthias Hess, PhD, and Ermias Kebreab, PhD, the co-principal investigators heading the livestock methane emissions portion of the research initiative, have focused on dietary interventions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. One such intervention, red seaweed, has led to significant decreases in methane emissions by lowering the expression of methane-producing genes in specific microbes in the cow\u2019s gut. But providing enough seaweed for daily consumption by the global cattle population\u2014reported at between 942.6 million head (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and 1.5 billion head (World Animal Foundation)\u2014would most likely not work, especially for the grazing cattle that account for most of the world\u2019s livestock. Researchers reason that early intervention with CRISPR, however, could reduce the methane emitted by cows and do so for nearly every calf. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to intervene when the calf is born,\u201d Ringeisen said. \u201cThe goal is to use these CRISPR tools and these characterization tools to find a stable microbiome that is a low methane microbiome, and then that that would hopefully set the calf to a lifetime of reduced emissions.\u201d \u201cOur partners at UC Davis innovated these feed supplements. But now we\u2019re turning their attention to these CRISPR tools and characterization tools to come up with new strategies, which I think are going to ultimately solve the larger problem which the feed supplements can\u2019t.\u201d Global reach The research group says it will disseminate the data it collects and the tools it develops to the global research community, and work with global nonprofits to help scale its advances. One global nonprofit the group is working with is the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR), a global research partnership with which the researchers have agreed to distribute its technologies to low- and middle-income farmers and ranchers. Ringeisen said IGI\u2019s public impact team will work to disseminate new technologies developed by the researchers through models that enable companies to profit in the most developed countries but provide the technologies at cost or lower in developing countries. IGI will soon go public with a task force\u2019s findings on how to broaden access to genomic therapeutics and interventions based on its technologies\u2014and do so affordably. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out ways to make these technologies more accessible, so that it can help more people in the world,\u201d Ringeisen said. Researchers hope to avoid with their technologies the years of legal wrangling that has surrounded the development of CRISPR-Cas9, which has been the subject of a bitter legal battle. Last year, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) sided against UC, Charpentier, and the University of Vienna, issuing a decision maintaining that the Broad Institute had priority in the invention of a single RNA CRISPR-Cas9 system that functions in eukaryotic cells. Beyond legal and logistical issues, an even more basic challenge for researchers is much less discovering what microbes exist than it is learning how they interact in community with other organisms. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand how to read the genome to predict what they\u2019re doing in complete detail,\u201d Banfield acknowledged. \u201cWe can predict a lot of the functionalities based on 100 years of laboratory bench work in biochemistry and genetics. But the part that\u2019s minimal and out of view is the set of genes that are involved in interactions with and amongst organisms, because they can\u2019t be probed by pure culture experiments.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about discovering new organisms, because we\u2019ve gone through that phase,\u201d Banfield added. \u201cIt\u2019s about discovering how they work in the context of their communities, and how that leads to manifestations of disease or undesirable ecosystem impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d","filter_flag":1}

Danfoss Debuts New Line of Liquid-Cooled System Modules at the 2023 Mari-Tech Conference April 18, 2023 - At the Mari-Tech 2023 Conference and Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia, April 18-20, Danfoss Power Electronics and Drives segment will debut the iC7 Series liquid-cooled system modules. The modules combine the world\u2019s highest power density, industry-leading liquid-cooled thermal management, unmatched security and easy system integration to deliver a drive with superior performance and which requires less room\u2014for an industry where space is worth its weight in gold. The iC7 series liquid-cooled system modules deliver world-class precision in motor control and modular control capacity. Secure-by-design, each iC7 drive is equipped with market-leading hardware-based protection against unauthorized access with a built-in crypto chip on the control unit. It uses a microSD card to copy settings, log data, download software and activate additional features \u2013 all protected by the crypto chip ensuring end-to-end encrypted data transfer. The iC7-Marine uncovers new marine performance levels, providing customers with confidence when it comes to defense and protection of their business, with the highest quality and reliable ultra-compact drives. In addition to showcasing the next generation of drive technology, Danfoss will also feature VACON NX Series, which has been driving decarbonization through electrification. The Danfoss VACON product line offers a complete range; the DC\/DC converters, drives, active front ends, and grid converters are all based on the same platform and are flexible and scalable. The savings in expensive diesel fuels, zero emissions and much lower operating noise levels are all benefits of an investment in electrification. Retrofitting older vessels with new power systems can help comply with initiatives put forth by many ports and municipalities to decrease carbon emissions and noise volume from vessels. Danfoss helped PortsToronto, which was faced with this challenge and was looking to fully decarbonize and retrofit the formerly diesel-powered Marilyn Bell I ferry. The ferry was retrofitted with the VACON NX Series and experienced a reduction of direct emissions by approximately 530 tons per year. The vessel makes four round trips per hour during a 19-hour day and recharges each time it docks at the mainland via an automated 400 kW pantograph charging system. This created a shore-to-vessel DC connection, the first of its kind in North America, which integrated with the Danfoss electrification system, utilizing the active front end module to convert the AC utility power to DC power for use by the vessel systems. As soon as the vessel docks and the vehicle ramp is lowered, the vessel starts charging via the pantograph, initiated using wireless communication between the vessel and the equipment on shore. From conception to installation, Danfoss\u2019 VACON Common DC-Bus electrification products worked seamlessly to make it possible for the Marilyn Bell I to be powered only by electricity from clean wind and solar sources, eliminating greenhouse gas emissions entirely. The marine industry is getting more intelligent, necessitating drives that come with built-in software capabilities and top-level computing power, including smart algorithms that provide superior speed, torque control and accuracy. No matter what the application, Danfoss can help marine customers improve the efficiency, safety and reliability of their offshore vessels.

Even as we live in a consumer-driven world, with a growing appetite for new things, if we begin to look at the waste created by this level of consumption in a different light, we might turn our problem into an opportunity. Credit Flickr What is recycling? Every day, we produce a vast amount of waste that ends up in landfills or polluting our oceans. From plastic bottles to food packaging, our throwaway culture is taking a toll on the environment. Recycling is one of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills and to mitigate the negative impact on the planet. Whether it\u2019s plastic, paper, or aluminum, the products, and materials that can be used after they fulfill their original purpose are far from worthless. In fact, most materials have great recycling value. The EPA estimates that up to 75% of all the waste can be recycled or repurposed, a figure that shows how impactful the process can be if done right. Almost everything we see around us can be technically recycled, although different materials require different techniques when they are recycled. Most of the commonly recyclable materials include batteries, biodegradable waste, clothing, electronics, garments, glass, metals, paper, plastics, and a lot more. Recycling is the process of separating, collecting, and remanufacturing or converting used or waste products into new materials. But if we want to truly focus on recycling, it\u2019s important to change the way we address it both on a personal and societal level. Recycling helps extend the life and usefulness of something that has already served its initial purpose by returning it to its raw materials and then using those materials to produce something that is usable. It\u2019s part of the three golden rules of sustainability (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) and has a lot of benefits both to us humans and to the environment. Virtually all of the environment is impacted by how much we recycle. Benefits of recycling The world\u2019s natural resources are finite, and some are in very short supply. At a fundamental level, recycling paper and wood can save trees and forests, recycling plastic means creating less new polluting plastic, recycling metals means there\u2019s less need for hugely costly mining, and recycling glass reduces the use of new raw materials like sand that affect coastal systems. Of course, the reality of it is much more complex, but the fundamental process is valid nonetheless. Some materials are technically recyclable, but doing so is so expensive it virtually never happens, while other materials retain their properties better than others. Metals, for instance, are repeatedly recyclable, while maintaining most or all of their properties. The most obvious benefit of recycling is the reduction of landfill waste. Landfills are rapidly filling up, and many cities are struggling to find new places to dump their trash. Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfills, making it a vital solution to the problem of overflowing landfills. When we recycle, we give new life to materials that would otherwise end up in a landfill. Recycling reduces the need to grow, harvest, or extract new raw materials from the Earth. That, in turn, reduces the harmful disruption and damage being done to the natural world, which means fewer forests cut down, rivers diverted, wild animals harmed or displaced, and less pollution. It\u2019s also much better to recycle existing products than to damage someone else\u2019s community or land during the exploration and exploitation of new raw materials. The demand for new goods has led to more of the poorest and most vulnerable people being displaced from their homes or otherwise exploited. Making products from recycled materials typically requires less energy than making them from new raw materials \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s a huge difference in energy. For example, producing new aluminum from old products uses 95% less energy than making it from scratch. For steel, the energy saving is around 70%. Recycling paper saves 60% of the energy required to produce new paper from wood pulp. By conserving energy, we reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the production process. While not always, manufacturing something the second time around usually consumes far less energy. Because recycling means you need to use less energy on sourcing and processing new raw materials, it produces lower carbon emissions, which means it can help with global warming. It also keeps potentially methane-releasing waste out of landfill sites. Overall, reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere is vital to stop climate change. Recycling also makes economic sense. As a rule of thumb, it\u2019s six times cheaper to dispose of recycled waste than general refuse. So, the more you recycle, and the less you put in the bin, the more money is saved \u2014 which should be good for households, businesses, and local public services. Recycling food waste and green waste is a great idea too, often generating lots of valuable compost. Recycling can stimulate the economy in multiple ways. The EPA has shown recycling helps to create jobs in both the recycling and manufacturing industries. Recycling companies need workers to collect, sort, and process materials. These jobs can range from manual labor to high-tech positions, providing employment opportunities for people with different levels of education and skill. A 2016 study said recycling activities account in a single year for 757,000 jobs, $36.6 billion in wages, and $6.7 billion in tax revenues. Recycling also helps protect wildlife. When we dispose of waste improperly, it can end up in our oceans and harm marine life. For example, plastic waste can entangle and suffocate sea turtles and other animals. By recycling, we reduce the amount of waste that ends up in our oceans and protect marine life. The steps of recycling Recycling includes three essential steps, which create a continuous loop, represented by the familiar recycling symbol. The first one is to actually collect the recyclables, which can be done in different ways. For example, they can be collected from the curbside, dropped off at centers, or gathered through deposit or refund programs. Following the collection, recyclables are sent to a recovery facility where they are sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing. Recyclables are then bought and sold just like raw materials would be, and prices go up and down depending on supply and demand. A growing number of products are being manufactured with recycled content. Common household items that contain recycled materials are newspapers, steel cans, plastic laundry detergents, and soft drink containers. Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in asphalt to pave roads. Consumers can help close the recycling loop by buying new products made from recycled materials. There are thousands of products that contain recycled content. When you go shopping, look for products that can be easily recycled and products that contain recycled content. Types of recycled materials It\u2019s important to recycle any materials possible, but one of the most relevant is plastic as it is such a big part of the solid waste that we make. When plastic is sent to a landfill, it does not break down as it\u2019s not biodegradable, and even in ocean water, plastic stays around virtually forever, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces called microplastics. Most plastics are used only once before they are discarded, known as single-use plastics \u2014 this type of single-use plastic is already being banned in many parts of the world. Recycling metal is also very important as it saves energy, reduces emissions, and creates jobs. Using recycled metal, known as scrap metal, instead of new metal reduces mining waste by 97% and saves more than 90% on energy, depending on the material. Recycling metals creates six times more jobs than sending the metals to a landfill. The same applies to paper recycling. One ton of recycled paper saves 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water. It also saves energy, about 4,000 kilowatts of it, enough t power an average American home for six months. Paper takes up a lot of space in landfills, so the more is recycled the better the landfills operate. Like paper, cardboard recycling uses less water, cuts back on emissions, saves prime real estate in landfills for materials that are not recyclable, and prevents deforestation. It is estimated that recycling one ton of cardboard can save 17 trees from harm, and 7,000 gallons of water. Reduce and reuse You may have heard of \u201cThe 3 R\u2019s\u201d: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. While recycling is important, the most effective way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place. Making a new product requires a lot of materials and energy and then the product has to be transported to wherever it will be sold. That means reducing and reusing are also important ways to protect the environment. Image via Wikipedia Commons Some of the ways to reduce and reuse include looking for products that use less packaging, which means less raw materials, buying reusable over disposable items, maintaining and repairing products like clothing so they don\u2019t have to be thrown away, as well as borrowing, renting or sharing items that are used infrequently like tools. Reducing our consumption should be the first step, and reusing also tends to be far more sustainable than recycling. Recycling means turning an item into raw materials which can be used again, either for the same product or a new one, while reusing means using an object as it is, without treatment. The reason why recycling is so important is that it prevents pollution, reduces the need to harvest new raw materials, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, saves money, reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, and allows products to be used to their fullest extent.

Disclaimer: The translations are mostly done through AI translator and might not be 100% accurate. New diesel-powered tow trucks and buses will not be sold in California starting in 2036 - a new rule approved by its regulators this Sunday to wean the state off fossil fuels and fight climate change. That rule would refer to exhaust pollution from heavy trucks transporting goods through ports and would require companies to disclose how much they use those trucks as early as 2024. However, that rule cannot be applied without approval from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, it is tied to standards the US government approved last month to phase out large diesel-powered box trucks, tow trucks and large buses. If the EPA approves the California rule, other states could later adopt the same standards. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Friday's decision was an opportunity to \"show the world what real climate action looks like.\" \"We are one step closer to achieving healthier neighborhoods and cleaner air for all Californians,\" he said in a statement. California is approving ambitious emissions standards as part of its broader goal of achieving \"carbon neutrality,\" meaning by 2045 it will remove as much carbon as it emits. Air pollution regulators previously voted to require all new cars, trucks and SUVs to be electric or hydrogen-powered by 2035. And they banned the sale of new products powered by small internal combustion engines, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers and portable generators. The vote on truck emissions came as the California Air Resources Board on Thursday approved a rule to phase out decades-old diesel locomotives and transition to more zero-emissions technology for pogo trains that transport food, lumber, oil and other products. But some in the transportation industry are concerned that the rule will ultimately increase the cost of goods being transported. The American Trucking Association called the rule \"unrealistic.\" The group is concerned about how costly a drastic transition to zero-emission vehicles will be and says the infrastructure to charge such electric vehicles is not ready. \"As it becomes clear that California's rhetoric does not match the technology, we hope the Board will reverse course and allow transportation companies the freedom to choose the clean technologies that work best for their business,\" the group said in a statement. Gas emissions from trucks have been drastically reduced in recent decades, according to the announcement. More than 100 zero-emission truck models are available in North America, state regulators say, and more than 100 others are in production. California's new rule, combined with previous state-approved electric truck regulations, would mean more than 2048 million zero-emissions medium- and heavy-duty trucks operating in the state by 1,6. Across the U.S., transportation contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA says, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks accounting for nearly a quarter of those emissions. Heavy-duty vehicles make up about three percent of the vehicles on California's roads, but generate more than half of the nitrogen oxide and fine particulate pollution from diesel, according to the California Air Resources Board. This is because these trucks have diesel engines which, although more powerful than petrol engines, produce more pollution. They also travel much more than passenger vehicles. California has many of these trucks on the road because it has two of the busiest ports in the world: Los Angeles and Long Beach. Of the 10 most ozone-polluted US cities, six are in California, according to the American Pulmonologist Association's State of the Air Report. \"You cannot overstate the importance of the actions being taken in California today from a public health perspective,\" said Will Barrett, national senior director for the association. Sam Wilson, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement that the technology is available to begin the transition to electric trucks. \"We need that standard to accelerate the necessary phase-out of fossil fuel trucks that pollute our air,\" Wilson said.

In the \"Overview of the Vision for Offshore Wind Power Industry (1st)\" announced in December 2020, 30 to 45 GW of project formation and a domestic procurement ratio of 60% were set as target by 2040. In the aforementioned background, we launched offshore wind turbine PJ team in April 2021, and started construction of Japan's first monopile type foundation manufacturing plant. Of the foundations for offshore wind turbines, the monopile type foundation consists of a monopile as a column and a transition piece for connection with a tower of the wind turbine. Monopiles and transition pieces are extra-thick, large-diameter, and long, super-heavy objects, and their size makes it difficult to manufacture at existing domestic plants. Once our new plant was completed, it will be Japan's first monopile type foundation manufacturing plant. We will promptly establish a domestic monopile manufacturing base, and in the future, we will add the jacket type foundation, which has already been extensively used in port piers, etc., and aim for a full lineup of all-made-in-Japan fixed-bottom foundations. We will surely respond to the rapidly expanding construction demand for offshore wind power generation and contribute significantly to the realization of carbon neutrality. If you would like to know more about our design technology development of offshore wind power foundation and construction plan of monopile manufacturing plant, please refer to the following JFE Group technical report.","filter_flag":1}
