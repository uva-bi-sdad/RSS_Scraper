The partnership will enable shoppers to drop off their plastic waste at designated collection bins that will be located at three Food City stores beginning in early 2024 in Kingsport, Tenn., where Eastman has its headquarters. The collected plastic will be sorted and processed at Eastman's new mixed-plastics processing facility, part of the new molecular recycling plant that, according to the company, is the largest material-to-material recycling facility in the world, scheduled to be completed around the end of 2023. \u201cFood City is excited to join forces with Eastman, a world-class company and a long-time leader in our community, to bring plastics recycling to our customers,\u201d said Steven C. Smith, Food City president and CEO. \u201cWe are always looking for ways to enhance our environmental stewardship and social responsibility, and this partnership will reduce our carbon footprint and support our local economy. Together, we can make a lasting impact across our region.\u201d The partnership is part of Eastman and Food City\u2019s commitment to advancing the circular economy and reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste. By offering collection bins for the public, the partnership will help divert plastic waste from landfills or incineration to create valuable new materials that can be used in a variety of applications again and again. Eastman\u2019s molecular recycling technology breaks down plastic waste into its molecular building blocks, which are then used to create new high-performance plastics that are indistinguishable from virgin materials. This technology can recycle plastics that are typically difficult to recycle, such as colored laundry detergent bottles, clamshell fruit packaging, polyester fabrics, shampoo bottles and much more. [Read more: \"100+ Grocery Brands Commit to Tackling Plastic Pollution\"] \u201cEastman is proud to partner with Food City, a fellow community leader and innovator, to bring an additional recycling option for plastics to our region,\u201d said Brad Lich, Eastman EVP and chief commercial officer. \u201cThis partnership demonstrates our shared vision for a more sustainable future, where plastic waste is seen as a valuable resource that can be transformed into new products. By collaborating with Food City, we are not only providing a solution for plastics recycling, but also educating and engaging our community about the benefits of molecular recycling and the circular economy.\u201d After its early 2024 launch at three Food City stores in Kingsport, the initiative will expand to other Food City locations in the region throughout the following months. Customers will be able to drop off their plastic waste, such as water bottles, colored laundry and shampoo bottles, trays, and fruit containers, among many other plastic items. Additional information about how to recycle plastic waste will be shared when the recycling program is officially launched. The collected plastic will be transported to Eastman\u2019s molecular recycling facility, where it will be converted into new materials for various durable goods applications. The move to provide drop-off locations for customers is in addition to an existing employee recycling program between Eastman and Food City, in which the grocer collects employee plastic waste and provides it to Eastman for molecular recycling. Eastman is a founding member of the U.S. Plastics Pact, a collaborative initiative to create a circular economy for plastics in the United States by 2025. Food City is a member of the Beyond the Bag Initiative, a multiyear collaboration to identify, test and implement innovative alternatives to single-use plastic retail bags. Food City\u2019s parent company, Abingdon, Va.-based K-VA-T Food Stores, operates more than 150 retail outlets throughout southeast Kentucky, southwest Virginia, east Tennessee, north Georgia and Alabama. K-VA-T is No. 70 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer\u2019s 2023 list of the top food and consumables retailers in North America.","filter_flag":1}

That\u2019s more than 567,000 tonnes of a mix\u00adture of rub\u00adber, car\u00adbon, sil\u00adi\u00adca, steel, tex\u00adtiles, and chem\u00adi\u00adcals. And yet tyres have a lifes\u00adpan of just a few years\u2026 Do you know what hap\u00adpens to our used tyres? In the same year, over 532,000 tonnes of tyres were col\u00adlect\u00aded, giv\u00ading a nation\u00adal col\u00adlec\u00adtion rate of 111.5%2! Since 2003, organ\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adtions that place tyres on the French mar\u00adket \u2013 man\u00adu\u00adfac\u00adtur\u00aders, dis\u00adtrib\u00adu\u00adtors, etc. \u2013 have been oblig\u00aded to take respon\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty for tyres at the end of their life cycle, based on the prin\u00adci\u00adple of extend\u00aded pro\u00adduc\u00ader respon\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty (EPR). In Europe, despite there being no spe\u00adcif\u00adic leg\u00adis\u00adla\u00adtion gov\u00adern\u00ading the sec\u00adtor, two direc\u00adtives apply. As a result, many Euro\u00adpean coun\u00adtries are imple\u00adment\u00ading EPR or oth\u00ader schemes to ensure the col\u00adlec\u00adtion of used tyres. In a study of 51 coun\u00adtries around the world3, it is esti\u00admat\u00aded that more than 17 mil\u00adlion tonnes of end-of-life tyres are col\u00adlect\u00aded each year, leav\u00ading 8 mil\u00adlion tonnes uncol\u00adlect\u00aded. Chi\u00adna, the Unit\u00aded States, Europe, Cana\u00adda, India and South Korea are among the biggest and\/or best collectors. We need to recov\u00ader used tyres in one way or another Copi\u00e9 ! Once they have been col\u00adlect\u00aded, they can be recy\u00adcled in a vari\u00adety of ways. In France in 2021, 15% of used tyres will be reused. Most of the used tyres col\u00adlect\u00aded (46.8%) are recov\u00adered for ener\u00adgy pur\u00adpos\u00ades, almost exclu\u00adsive\u00adly in cement works. In this case, instead of using fos\u00adsil fuels, tyres are used as an alter\u00adna\u00adtive fuel to pro\u00adduce the ener\u00adgy need\u00aded for cement kilns. The final way of recov\u00ader\u00ading used tyres is through recy\u00adcling. By 2021, 35.8% of used tyres will be recy\u00adcled. Reduced to aggre\u00adgate, melt\u00aded down in cement works or steel\u00adworks, or shred\u00added: a whole range of new lives open up for tyres recov\u00adered as mate\u00adri\u00adals. \u201cMost of the tyres we recy\u00adcle are trans\u00adformed into mould\u00aded objects \u2013 such as speed bumps \u2013 sport pitch\u00ades, drainage mate\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal or are used in steel\u00adworks to replace some of the anthracite\u201d, explains Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre from Ali\u00ada\u00adpur. In 2010, the organ\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adtion assessed the envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal impact of sub\u00adsti\u00adtut\u00ading end-of-life tyres for prod\u00aducts from dif\u00adfer\u00adent sec\u00adtors4. The ben\u00ade\u00adfits are clear for Astro\u00adturf, mould\u00aded objects and cement works, but min\u00adi\u00admal for reten\u00adtion basins. A num\u00adber of envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal indi\u00adca\u00adtors exist. For exam\u00adple, sub\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion for Astro\u00adturf avoids the emis\u00adsion of 3 tonnes of CO 2 equiv\u00ada\u00adlent for each tonne of used tyres recov\u00adered. The process also uses 15 m3 less water. Mate\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal recov\u00adery from used tyres is the pre\u00adferred method of recov\u00adery under the Envi\u00adron\u00adment Code5, after re-use. How\u00adev\u00ader, most end-of-life tyres are recov\u00adered in the form of ener\u00adgy. \u201cThis sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion is spe\u00adcif\u00adic to France; we don\u2019t see the same trends in oth\u00ader Euro\u00adpean coun\u00adtries,\u201d explains Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cBut it\u2019s a one-off sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion and linked to recent Euro\u00adpean reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions \u2013 aimed at ban\u00adning the incor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtion of microplas\u00adtics and the use of rub\u00adber gran\u00adu\u00adlates in syn\u00adthet\u00adic sports pitch\u00ades.\u201d Anoth\u00ader obsta\u00adcle to recy\u00adcling is the pos\u00adsi\u00adble out\u00adlets. \u201cWe need to recov\u00ader used tyres in one way or anoth\u00ader, and the ener\u00adgy recov\u00adery require\u00adments of cement works mean that they can absorb large vol\u00adumes. We need to cre\u00adate ways of recov\u00ader\u00ading mate\u00adri\u00adals that require large vol\u00adumes, and there\u00adfore with suf\u00adfi\u00adcient added val\u00adue.\u201d says Ludovic Moulin. Tougher reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions could, how\u00adev\u00ader, push the indus\u00adtry to increase the pro\u00adpor\u00adtion of end-of-life tyres recy\u00adcled. \u201cIn 2020, the anti-waste law imposed a new tight\u00aden\u00ading-up on the sec\u00adtor: com\u00adpa\u00adnies must be accred\u00adit\u00aded,\u201d explains Thomas Grandin. This require\u00adment will be laid down in a decree and an order6 in 2023, set\u00adting out the spec\u00adi\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtions for the sector\u2019s eco-organ\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adtions. These impose recy\u00adcling tar\u00adgets on the tyres col\u00adlect\u00aded: from 40% in 2024 to 42% in 2028 of the quan\u00adti\u00adties of waste col\u00adlect\u00aded. \u201cWe have also not\u00aded that social accep\u00adtance is a bar\u00adri\u00ader, but there is no tech\u00adni\u00adcal bar\u00adri\u00ader to recy\u00adcling,\u201d asserts Jean-Philippe Faure. Aiming for zero waste thanks to pyrolysis Tyres are made up of over 200 dif\u00adfer\u00adent mate\u00adri\u00adals. But ful\u00adly devel\u00adoped sep\u00ada\u00adra\u00adtion process\u00ades do exist. The aim is to iso\u00adlate the dif\u00adfer\u00adent com\u00adpo\u00adnents to offer prod\u00aducts with a high added val\u00adue. \u201cFor some years now, the trend has been towards the devel\u00adop\u00adment of pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis,\u201d points out Ludovic Moulin. By heat\u00ading the tyre to a very high tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture and in the absence of oxy\u00adgen, it is pos\u00adsi\u00adble to recov\u00ader a num\u00adber of prod\u00aducts: car\u00adbon black, pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis oil, steel-met\u00adal rein\u00adforce\u00adments, gas, tex\u00adtiles, etc. Although still mar\u00adgin\u00adal in many coun\u00adtries, this process is the main way of recov\u00ader\u00ading end-of-life tyres in Chi\u00adna, Thai\u00adland, Indone\u00adsia and Mex\u00adi\u00adco, \u201cbecause of insuf\u00adfi\u00adcient or non-exis\u00adtent envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal con\u00adstraints,\u201d explains Ludovic Moulin. \u201cBetween the health cri\u00adsis and fears about raw mate\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal sup\u00adplies, the cir\u00adcu\u00adlar econ\u00ado\u00admy is gain\u00ading momen\u00adtum and the mar\u00adket is now open\u00ading up to these new prod\u00aducts,\u201d com\u00adments Thomas Grandin. In Europe, Miche\u00adlin has announced the cre\u00adation of the first pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis site with Swedish start-up Envi\u00adro, which is set to han\u00addle 1 mil\u00adlion tonnes of used tyres by 2030. \u201cOth\u00ader projects are under\u00adway in Ger\u00admany (Pyrum Inno\u00adva\u00adtions), Spain (L4T and Green\u00adval Tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies) and the UK (Bold\u00ader Indus\u00adtries),\u201d adds Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cThis approach is set to take off in the next few years.\u201d Fund\u00aded by the Euro\u00adpean Union and coor\u00addi\u00adnat\u00aded by Miche\u00adlin, the Black Cycle project7 aims to demon\u00adstrate the via\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty of the cir\u00adcu\u00adlar econ\u00ado\u00admy for pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis. The con\u00adsor\u00adtium aims to opti\u00admise the pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis process. The aim? Zero waste. Both the car\u00adbon black and the pyrol\u00ady\u00adsis oil \u2013 trans\u00adformed into car\u00adbon black \u2013 recov\u00adered will be entire\u00adly reused to man\u00adu\u00adfac\u00adture new tyres. Oth\u00ader projects aim to explore new ways of recov\u00ader\u00ading used tyres. \u201cPub\u00adlic works are the most promis\u00ading sec\u00adtor for the future,\u201d says Jean-Philippe Fau\u00adre. \u201cFor exam\u00adple, there is a need for new types of back\u00adfill, capa\u00adble of absorb\u00ading shock and being light and flex\u00adi\u00adble.\u201d Recy\u00adcled tyres could even be incor\u00adpo\u00adrat\u00aded into pave\u00adments using a mix\u00adture of recy\u00adcled con\u00adcrete and rub\u00adber aggre\u00adgates8.

At a classical music concert in the picturesque city of Lucerne in September, two climate activists glued themselves to the stage. The orchestra\u2019s performance wheezed to a halt, much to the audience\u2019s chagrin. After a brief negotiation, conductor Vladimir Jurowski announced a truce: The young protestors would be allowed to make their case, everyone in the audience would listen, and the concert would continue. What the protesters demanded wasn\u2019t an end to oil exploration, or that everyone stop flying or driving, or that the old guard step down for having let the planet burn. Instead, they called for something else entirely: that all Swiss homes be renovated by 2030 so they could stay cool in summer, and warm in winter\u2014but while using much less energy. The Lucerne saga was over after four minutes. But the Renovate Switzerland movement has engineered dozens of similar protests in the country since 2022, some of them much more disruptive\u2014including a blocking of the main Geneva lake bridge by protestors similarly glued to the surface, and protestors \u201cslow-walking\u201d traffic by marching down the middle of busy city streets. What the actions have in common is an urgent plea for a less carbon-dioxide-heavy \u201cbuilt environment.\u201d It\u2019s a demand that makes sense. For all the attention given to cars, trucks, and airplanes, it turns out that houses and buildings actually make up the world\u2019s single largest source of CO2 emissions, at a staggering 39%. The production of cement alone\u2014omnipresent in our buildings, bridges, and sidewalks\u2014is responsible for almost a quarter of those emissions. That\u2019s due to the chemical processes and intense heat required to manufacture it, most of which typically involve fossil fuels. Ultimately, any call for a greener built environment is a call for greener cement and concrete, produced less resource-intensively and designed to fit in energy-efficient buildings. A serious effort to use more eco-friendly cement would create construction jobs, slash residents\u2019 energy bills, and get just about every country and institution much closer to its zero-emissions goals. It sounds like a win-win, really. So why isn\u2019t green cement the global norm in construction? A few miles northeast of Lucerne, one Fortune 500 Europe company is trying to make it so. Holcim, based in Zug, is the world\u2019s largest cement company outside of China, with a production capacity of 260 million metric tons per year. It has been a global giant for decades\u2014it brought in more than $30 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year\u2014and that means that it has been responsible for a large share of its industry\u2019s historical carbon footprint. But Holcim is now trying to be part of the solution, developing low-emissions cement and concrete while creating materials for energy-neutral buildings. If Holcim\u2019s eco strategy succeeds, it could secure the company\u2019s continued dominance in its industry and make it a lighthouse for other European and global companies to follow. Over the last decade, it has shown remarkable progress. The question is whether it can keep progressing quickly enough to meaningfully protect the planet\u2014and to exorcise the demons of its own past. A new challenge for \u2018the waste guy\u2019 Clemens Woegerbauer, a director of Holcim\u2019s Swiss subsidiary, first started thinking about low-carbon cement some 10 years ago, when a request from Zurich-based construction company Eberhardt landed on his desk. The question was as simple as it was intractable: Could Holcim help Eberhardt get rid of its construction demolition waste, and perhaps recycle it into new cement and concrete? Getting rid of construction and demolition debris was familiar work for Woegerbauer; in fact, he was known internally at Holcim as \u201cthe waste guy.\u201d But the idea of reusing the waste was a new one\u2014and it arrived, in a sense, at just the right time and just the right place. Clemens Woegerbauer, Holcim\u2019s self-described \u2018waste guy.\u2019 Courtesy of Holcim A similar approach had been used by Europeans since at least Roman times, with bricks and stones from older buildings reused to construct new ones. (My own family in Belgium used to own property on which the remains of an eighth-century church were found, built with recycled stones from an ancient Roman villa. The \u201crecycled\u201d church stood for almost a thousand years.) But by the end of the 20th century, building codes all but prohibited the reuse or recycling of demolition waste all over Europe and the world\u2014including in the United States, Holcim\u2019s largest market and the source of over $10 billion of its yearly revenues. There was good reason to be cautious: Some low-quality construction materials used between the 1950s and 1990s, for example, turned out to have a life span of just 30 years, leading to a ban on their use. But even the recycling of stronger concrete, several researchers believed until recently, yielded material that lacked the strength of its \u201cvirgin\u201d equivalent, making it a hazardous tool. By the time Woegerbauer started grappling with the issue, however, the mindset around recycled materials was starting to change\u2014in landlocked Switzerland in particular. The Alpine country\u2019s population largely lives on a sliver of land dubbed the \u201cmiddle country,\u201d sandwiched between the Alps and the Jura mountains. Switzerland\u2019s cities, lakes, agriculture, and industry all have to share this plateau; the last thing anyone needed was for this precious land to be used for construction waste sites. As a result, by the 2000s, the practice of recycling of construction and demolition debris was well established in Switzerland, and Swiss regulators were amenable to expanding that practice. Woegerbauer and his team had their own reasons to fulfill Eberhardt\u2019s wishes. First, recycled cement could be a new source of income. Eberhardt had to pay to get rid of its waste anyway, so it would gladly pay Holcim to do the same. If Holcim could incorporate the waste into new products, it would win twice: once when it received Eberhardt\u2019s waste, and again when it sold its recycled cement products. Just as important was how recycled cement would fit into Holcim\u2019s future business model. If Woegerbauer\u2019s Swiss team could square the circle of construction demolition material recycling, the company might go from villain to hero on CO2 emissions. \u2018Decarbonizing building\u2019 vs. selling cement Holcim was undergoing changes at the top too. In 2017, the company appointed Jan Jenisch, the head of Swiss chemical company Sika, as its new CEO. As an outsider, Jenisch realized that Holcim needed to adapt to remain relevant in the 21st century. Ever since its founding in the petite Swiss town of Holderbank in 1912\u2014Holcim is short for Holderbank Ciment\u2014the company had been expanding through mergers and volume plays. Cement is a commodity, and for a long time the company\u2019s philosophy was that bigger was better and biggest was best. But after Holcim merged with its longtime rival, France\u2019s Lafarge, in 2015, there were essentially no meaningful acquisition targets left. Just as important, governments and public opinion were growing increasingly vocal in their dissatisfaction with the huge amounts of CO2 the cement industry emitted each year. For Holcim\u2019s dominance to remain the same, everything had to change. \u201cWhen I joined, I found strong, locally embedded businesses, 2,300 production sites, right-in-time supply, the largest building-material company in the world,\u201d Jenisch told me. But what got Holcim to 2017 wouldn\u2019t get it to 2027 or beyond, he also realized. \u201cYou have to think about how markets will develop in the future,\u201d he said. Those developments still included growth and new construction, he firmly believed, given the world\u2019s growing population and urbanization. But it would have to be built on different foundations than before: those of innovation and sustainability, rather than commodities and volume. Any other approach would not have societal buy-in. Jenisch brought on board a few newcomers to realize his mission, including Magali Anderson, a French engineer who had spent most of her career working on safety in the oil industry. Anderson joined as head of safety, but soon took on a more significant role: that of Holcim\u2019s first-ever chief sustainability officer. The new team soon embarked on a new strategy, culminating in the company\u2019s signing of a \u201cnet zero\u201d pledge in September 2020, aiming for the horizon of 2050. Instead of selling cement, Holcim reinterpreted its role in the industry as \u201cdecarbonizing building.\u201d To an outsider, such a statement may have reeked of greenwashing\u2014akin to a cigarette company stating it wants people to stop smoking. But each component of the new strategy came with a cold business rationale. Decarbonizing was going to either reduce costs or create extra revenues. On a visit to one of Holcim\u2019s cement plants, in the Swiss town of Ecl\u00e9pens, I saw several of the company\u2019s decarbonizing mechanisms at work. Holcim had reduced much of its fossil fuel use there, and had created an additional revenue stream by using waste fuel instead\u2014burning material that Holcim had been paid to dispose of. A live video feed of the kiln showed how shredded old tires and biomass were fed into the fire. The plant also rethought the composition of its concrete: Instead of using \u201cclinker,\u201d which is made by breaking down limestone in a highly CO2-intensive process, the company is using calcine clay and other, lower-emissions materials wherever possible. In its construction projects, too, Holcim aimed to build better with less. Adopting practices from Roman times, it experimented with using gravitational forces or metal clamps, rather than mortar, to hold archlike structures together. In its floorings, it would use concrete only where it had structural effects, replacing it with lighter, less CO2-heavy product mixes where possible. To make up for the loss in volume of cement or concrete sold, it would come up with new applications for its products. Finally, Holcim would take a more holistic approach to its role in the building sector. What if its concrete wall and floors could be components of buildings that could be heated and cooled in a carbon-neutral fashion? What if its concrete could fit into green urban architecture, rather than be a nemesis of it? A Waldorf School in Germany, built with Elevate RubberGard EPDM, a climate-friendly roofing material made by Holcim. Courtesy of Holcim In its revamped global innovation hub in Lyon, France, a team of engineers came up with all kinds of innovations. On a visit late this summer, I saw what those efforts had led to, over a few short years: a superlight isolation layer for roofs, for example, that felt to the touch more like chocolate mousse than concrete and is better suited for hot climates. Or concrete walls with plant seeds mixed in, which could then turn the walls into Babylon-esque hanging gardens over time as rain poured through them. Many of those innovations are still analogous to what concept cars are for car manufacturers: a proof of the company\u2019s imagination and engineering prowess, but not products that have real-world impact today. Still, more of the products are crossing the barrier between theory and practice. A recently finished school in Vienna is a fitting exhibit: Finished earlier this year, the school, entirely built with state-of-the-art Holcim products, is capable of covering 90% of its energy needs through internal geothermal processes, the company claims. In France and Kenya, meanwhile, Holcim has been experimenting with 3D printing of homes and bridges as a sustainable solution. 3D printing lets contractors and architects use concrete only where it is strictly needed; that means the structures built with it retain the same strength while using up to 50% less material, Holcim says. A pandemic turning point In 2020, the COVID pandemic stopped economic life throughout much of the global economy. Much of Holcim\u2019s global leadership team wound up being stuck in Switzerland for the better part of a year. For Clemens Woegerbauer and his local team, that proved to be a lucky break. After years of investments in product R&D, and as much time spent wooing regulatory commissions, their Susteno cement\u2014of which 20% came from recycled demolition waste\u2014had been making inroads on the Swiss market for two years. The lockdown gave Woegerbauer a chance to show off the product to a captive audience: his global HQ colleagues, who would otherwise have been traveling all over the world taking meetings at other Holcim subsidiaries. Susteno was a runaway success. \u201cI was very surprised, but it was good to see how open the group was [to our product],\u201d Woegerbauer said. \u201cIt was the right place and the right time. Everything converged.\u201d Soon after, Jenisch and his executive team floored the accelerator on their global decarbonization strategy. In July 2020, Holcim launched Ecopact, a type of concrete with a reduced CO2 footprint of at least 30%, in the U.S., its largest market. In 2021 and 2022, further additions to the \u201ceco\u201d range of products followed, including Ecoplanet, Holcim\u2019s green cement, and Ecocycle, a range of recycled products directly inspired by the Susteno recycling brand. The years since have vindicated Holcim\u2019s strategy\u2014and the Swiss innovations that catalyzed it. Today, Ecopact and Ecoplanet are blockbusters, with each posting more than a billion dollars in global sales. The \u201ceco\u201d range of products helped Holcim to record revenues and profits in 2022, and by the fall of 2023, almost a fifth of Holcim\u2019s global sales came from the eco brands. In the U.S., Amazon became a marquee Ecopact client, using the concrete for its new data warehouses in northern Virginia and giving the brand additional credibility in Holcim\u2019s biggest market. The concrete mix used in the project there, the companies said, would reduce the CO2 footprint of the concrete by 39%. The new CAP Group Headquarters building in Milan uses Holcim\u2019s Ecopact concrete. Courtesy of Holcim Holcim also proved it could decouple revenue growth from greenhouse gas emissions. Its CO2 emissions per ton of cement produced dropped by 29% since the 1990s, the company calculated. The company has also diversified its product mix. Since 2020, CO2 emissions per dollar of net sales at the company have dropped by 43%\u2014the result of a combination of higher prices, a further lowering of the CO2 intensity of its cement and concrete, and greater sales of other, less CO2-heavy building products. Holcim\u2019s overall climate goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050 is now backed by what wonks call \u201cscience-based targets.\u201d Practically, it means that if every company acted like Holcim, global warming would be limited to 1.5 degree Celsius between now and 2050, rather than the more than 2.5-degree pathway it is on now. Legal and regulatory battles loom Holcim\u2019s recent transformation is a remarkable turnaround story. A company that just a few years ago was seen as a major villain by climate activists is now hell-bent on proving it can be a green ally. But to continue its sustainability winning streak, Holcim will have to outrun its more distant past. In Switzerland, Holcim faces a potentially precedent-setting lawsuit from a group of Pacific Islanders. The plaintiffs hail from the Indonesian island of Pari, one of many Pacific islands drastically affected by global-warming-induced sea level rise. In a court in Zug, they are seeking damages from Holcim for the company\u2019s role in emitting the greenhouse gas emissions they believe are responsible for their deteriorated living conditions. According to a report by the Climate Accountability Institute, commissioned by an NGO that supports the plaintiffs, Holcim and its predecessors are responsible for 0.4% of all global postwar CO2 emissions\u2014more than 7 billion tons of the greenhouse gas. If the judge finds Holcim liable, it could open the floodgates to similar cases from affected populations elsewhere, imperiling the company\u2019s future. Regulation also stands in its way of further growth. In the U.S., for example, building codes don\u2019t allow for the kind of recycling that Holcim is allowed to do in Switzerland. Any U.S. client that wants to use recycled cement in its concrete construction can do so only with a workaround, the company told me. In the case of the Amazon warehouses, for example, the low-carbon cement had to be transported from Spain and then used to make concrete in the U.S. in order to comply with local rules. Holcim will need to convince more regulators that recycled cement is viable, or the company will face a big roadblock in its sustainability journey. Jenisch\u2019s focus is clearly talks with regulators rather than Holcim\u2019s dealings in court. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can accept historical responsibility,\u201d he said of the lawsuit by the islanders. \u201cIt\u2019s more important what action we take now. This is what I want to be part of.\u201d But it\u2019s all hands on the regulatory deck for Jenisch. This summer, Magali Anderson announced her departure as Holcim\u2019s chief sustainability officer. Like her predecessor, Nollaig Forrest, the new CSO, has no training in engineering or safety. But she\u2019s steeped in government affairs and communications, skills she honed at other industrial groups such as Dow, DuPont, and American fragrance maker Firmenich. Forrest\u2019s main job now, she told me, is to get regulators to embrace Holcim\u2019s vision of sustainability in construction, especially in the U.S. and the European Union, where Holcim gets the lion\u2019s share of its sales. One tactic Holcim is considering, she said, is to convince regulators in a large, influential state such as California of the effectiveness of Holcim\u2019s approach, with the aim of creating a snowball effect across the country. It has been a tried and tested method in regulation of other green technologies, including electric vehicles. One stakeholder Forrest and her colleagues will still have to win over is Renovate Switzerland. It\u2019s not that the organization doesn\u2019t appreciate the efforts Holcim has undertaken so far. \u201cFrom what we know, there is a lot of nice work, but [some of it] may be a false promise too,\u201d Marie Seidel, a spokesperson for the organization, told me over the phone. Overall, the organization remains unconvinced that a company whose business model depends on cement and concrete can ever be a champion of a carbon-neutral world. \u201cWhat our society needs right now is a complete U-turn in the way we consider the climate crisis,\u201d Seidel said. \u201cIf Holcim would take this issue seriously, they would stop building buildings that emit CO2 at all, not 30% less.\u201d For Renovate Switzerland, in other words, 2050 should start tomorrow. Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the town where Holcim was founded; it is Holderbank, not Holderberg. A version of this article appears in the December 2023\/January 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cConcrete results.\u201d","filter_flag":1}
