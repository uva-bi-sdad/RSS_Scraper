Recycling: Watch our video to find out what happens with recyclables in the blue bins - Miami University	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL21pYW1pb2guZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMi9yZWN5Y2xpbmctb24tY2FtcHVzLWhvdy1hcmUtcmVjeWNsYWJsZS1pdGVtcy1zb3J0ZWQtYW5kLXByb2Nlc3NlZC13YXRjaC1vdXItYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMtdmlkZW8uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5	Miami University facilitates recycling on campus through blue single-stream recycle bins placed next to gray waste bins. Collected recyclables are transported to Rumpke Waste & Recycling's facility where they are sorted, processed, and sold to be turned into new products using advanced methods like robotic arms and optical sorting. A significant portion of the processed material is sold to Ohio manufacturers. An interactive quiz is available to help people determine what can be recycled.	TRUE: This initiative promotes recycling and resource recovery, which contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing waste and promoting circular economy practices.	FALSE: The text describes a recycling process and initiative but does not refer to a new or improved product or business process introduced on the market by a firm.	FALSE: The article discusses recycling processes rather than a specific good or service designed to significantly reduce environmental impact.	TRUE: The recycling system and methods used by Rumpke Waste & Recycling exemplify a green process by minimizing waste, conserving resources, and employing sustainable technologies.

Why Tennessee would benefit from recycling more glass | Opinion - Tennessean	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZW5uZXNzZWFuLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbnRyaWJ1dG9ycy8yMDIzLzAyLzEwL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LXRlbm5lc3NlZS13b3VsZC1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tcmVjeWNsaW5nLW1vcmUtZ2xhc3MvNjk4OTAxNzEwMDcv0gEA?oc=5	The article discusses the importance of glass recycling in Tennessee, highlighting the environmental and economic benefits of reusing glass instead of sending it to landfills. It emphasizes the potential for improved infrastructure and legislative support to enhance glass recycling efforts in the state. The authors advocate for the Tennessee CLEAN Act as a necessary step toward reducing litter and recovering valuable materials for recycling.	TRUE, because the article promotes glass recycling, which reduces waste and energy consumption, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability goals.	FALSE, because while it discusses recycling efforts, it does not introduce a new or significantly improved product or process by a specific firm.	TRUE, because recycled glass can be considered a green product as it is designed and processed to minimize environmental impact and conserve natural resources.	TRUE, because the act of recycling glass involves methods that minimize environmental impacts and promote sustainability through waste reduction and resource conservation.	Strategic Materials, Inc.

Mapping the flat glass value-chain: a material flow analysis and energy balance of UK production - Glass on Web	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ2xhc3NvbndlYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXBwaW5nLWZsYXQtZ2xhc3MtdmFsdWUtY2hhaW4tbWF0ZXJpYWwtZmxvdy1hbmFseXNpcy1hbmQtZW5lcmd5LWJhbGFuY2UtdWstcHJvZHVjdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5	The article discusses the UK glass industry, which is classified as energy-intensive and aims to improve its production processes by increasing the use of recycled glass (cullet) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. It identifies inefficiencies in the supply chain and explores opportunities for enhanced recycling methods to support the UK's net-zero strategy. The study highlights the environmental benefits of incorporating post-consumer cullet in new glass production, proposing various recovery scenarios to achieve significant emission savings. Lastly, barriers to recycling and the economic implications of these improvements are also discussed.	TRUE: The article details innovations aimed at enhancing environmental sustainability through the increased use of recycled materials in glass production, contributing to decarbonization and reduced resource consumption.	TRUE: The article identifies improvements in the glass manufacturing process and product offerings that significantly differ from previous practices, which constitutes a business innovation.	FALSE: The article does not specifically name a product that meets the definition of a green product but discusses the general category of glass products made with increased recycled content.	TRUE: The article describes processes in glass production that focus on resource efficiency and sustainability by promoting the recycling of cullet, which minimizes environmental impacts.	company not identified	product or process not identified	not found	Likely NAICS Codes: 327212 - Brick and Structural Clay Tile Manufacturing, 327213 - Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing, 327991 - Cut Stone and Stone Product Manufacturing, 423320 - Brick, Stone, and Related Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers	FALSE: The article does not exhibit greenwashing as it provides evidence-based discussion on real innovations aimed at improving sustainability rather than making misleading claims about environmental benefits.	16911
