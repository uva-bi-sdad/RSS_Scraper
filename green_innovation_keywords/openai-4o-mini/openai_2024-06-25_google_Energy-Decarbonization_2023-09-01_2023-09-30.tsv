The research, conducted with WSP, highlights the importance of transforming existing buildings through energy-efficient electric solutions and smart management technologies. This approach is applicable to various building types and climates and promotes faster, less disruptive renovations. The findings underscore the necessity of addressing operational emissions to achieve net-zero goals by 2050.	TRUE, because the research focuses on retrofitting buildings to significantly reduce their carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency, aligning with environmental sustainability goals.	TRUE, as it discusses the introduction of new methods (digital building and power management solutions) that improve the business process of managing energy in buildings, representing a significant improvement over previous methods.	FALSE, this article does not discuss a specific good but rather focuses on processes and strategies for decarbonization, which do not qualify as a green product.	TRUE, because it describes a method of retrofitting office buildings using digital technologies to enhance energy efficiency and decrease environmental impact, fitting the definition of a green process.
