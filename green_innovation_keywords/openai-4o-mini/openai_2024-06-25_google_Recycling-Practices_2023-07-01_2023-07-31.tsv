Turning polystyrene into new products - Newswise	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90dXJuaW5nLXBvbHlzdHlyZW5lLWludG8tbmV3LXByb2R1Y3Rz0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly9tLm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90dXJuaW5nLXBvbHlzdHlyZW5lLWludG8tbmV3LXByb2R1Y3Rz?oc=5	Researchers from Virginia Tech have developed a thermochemical method called 'Degradation Upcycling' (Deg-Up) that enables the recycling of polystyrene waste into valuable chemicals through a two-step process. This innovative technique uses inexpensive aluminum chloride catalysts and moderate temperatures to efficiently break down polystyrene into benzene and its derivatives, which are essential for industries such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The method represents a significant advancement in chemical upcycling, providing a sustainable alternative for recycling polystyrene when mechanical methods are not feasible. It promotes a circular economy by transforming waste into value-added products.	TRUE: This is green innovation because it facilitates recycling and reduces environmental impact by converting polystyrene waste into valuable chemicals, aligning with sustainability goals.	TRUE: This is a business innovation as it describes a new and improved process for recycling polystyrene, differing significantly from previous practices and introducing new market applications.	FALSE: This is not a green product because while it relates to reducing waste, it does not describe a specific product that is being marketed as environmentally friendly.	TRUE: This is a green process as it minimizes environmental impacts by creating a method for recycling polystyrene waste while producing valuable chemicals and utilizing inexpensive, energy-efficient techniques.	company not identified	product or process not identified	not found	Likely NAICS Codes: 325110 - Petrochemical Manufacturing, 325120 - Industrial Gas Manufacturing, 326150 - Urethane and Other Foam Product (except Polystyrene) Manufacturing, 811210 - Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance	FALSE: The article does not suggest greenwashing as it credibly describes a genuine innovation in recycling polystyrene waste without exaggerating the environmental benefits or making misleading claims.	2017
