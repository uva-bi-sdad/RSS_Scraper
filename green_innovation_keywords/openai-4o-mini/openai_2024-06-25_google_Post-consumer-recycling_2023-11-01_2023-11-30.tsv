Stricter EU waste legislation and increasing public awareness are driving manufacturers to shift from incinerating unsold garments to adopting recycling practices. Although only 20% of textile waste is recycled, advancements in both mechanical and chemical recycling methods are being developed to create high-quality post-consumer materials while addressing the challenges of diverse material compositions. New sorting technologies like Fibersort aim to improve the recycling process, contributing towards a circular economy in fashion.	TRUE: The article discusses innovations that significantly reduce the environmental impact of the textile industry through sustainable recycling technologies and methods aimed at fostering a circular economy.	TRUE: The article highlights new and improved recycling processes and technologies that deviate significantly from traditional textile waste management practices, representing business innovation in the industry.	FALSE: While the article discusses recycling innovations, it does not mention specific products that are designed, manufactured, and used in a way that reduces environmental impact throughout their life cycle.	TRUE: The article details various recycling processes used to manage post-consumer textile waste, which minimize environmental impacts and promote sustainability, including mechanical and chemical recycling methods.	company not identified	product or process not identified	not found	Likely NAICS Codes: 314110 - Carpet and Rug Mills, 315190 - Other Apparel Knitting Mills, 316110 - Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing, 423210 - Furniture Merchant Wholesalers	FALSE: The article provides factual information on advancing technologies in textile recycling rather than making misleading claims, therefore it does not constitute greenwashing.	2970
