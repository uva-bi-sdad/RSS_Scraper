NIR test program reveals factors affecting flexible packaging sorting - Labels and Labeling	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmxhYmVsc2FuZGxhYmVsaW5nLmNvbS9ldXJvcGUvbmV3cy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9uaXItdGVzdC1wcm9ncmFtLXJldmVhbHMtZmFjdG9ycy1hZmZlY3RpbmctZmxleGlibGUtcGFja2FnaW5nLXNvcnRpbmfSAQA?oc=5	The article discusses a project by CEFLEX that focuses on enhancing the design for recycling of flexible plastic packaging using NIR sorting technology. It highlights the collaboration of various stakeholders and the testing of over 240 packaging material samples to generate open-source data that informs better recycling practices. The project aims to improve industry knowledge and optimize sorting outcomes by providing rigorous data on materials and their impact on recycling processes.	TRUE: This is green innovation because it contributes to environmental sustainability by improving the recyclability of flexible packaging, thereby aiding in the circular economy and reducing waste.	TRUE: This qualifies as business innovation as it involves new data and processes that significantly differ from previous practices, aiming to enhance market outcomes for flexible packaging recycling.	FALSE: The article does not introduce a specific green product but focuses on processes and data related to packaging design.	TRUE: This is a green process because it describes methods aimed at optimizing sorting and recycling of packaging to minimize environmental impacts.
