Ireland's new national air quality forecast goes live today - TheJournal.ie	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpvdXJuYWwuaWUvZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWFnZW5jeS1haXItcXVhbGl0eS1mb3JlY2FzdC02MjEzMjUyLU5vdjIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5	The EPA has launched a national air quality forecast online to help the public plan outdoor activities while minimizing exposure to poor air quality. The forecast utilizes data from monitoring stations across Ireland to assess and predict air quality levels based on specific pollutants. This resource aims to inform individuals, particularly those with respiratory conditions, about air quality, thereby contributing to public health. The forecast maps are generated from models developed under the EU Life Emerald project.
