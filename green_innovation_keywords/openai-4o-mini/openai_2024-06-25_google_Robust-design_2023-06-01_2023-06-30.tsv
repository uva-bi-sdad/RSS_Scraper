thyssenkrupp Uhde and Johnson Matthey providing technologies for ammonia plant in Turkey - ChemEngOnline	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVtZW5nb25saW5lLmNvbS90aHlzc2Vua3J1cHAtdWhkZS1hbmQtam9obnNvbi1tYXR0aGV5LXByb3ZpZGluZy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtZm9yLWFtbW9uaWEtcGxhbnQtaW4tdHVya2V5Lz9wcmludG1vZGU9MdIBAA?oc=5	Thyssenkrupp Uhde and Johnson Matthey have been commissioned by İGSAŞ to supply a new cartridge for an ammonia plant aimed at reducing pressure in the synthesis loop while maintaining a capacity of 1,200 metric tons per day. The new modular design improves safety and accessibility during installation, while the combination with Johnson Matthey's catalyst is expected to enhance plant performance and energy consumption. This upgrade aligns with future readiness for potential green ammonia production. The new equipment fabrication is underway, with a startup planned for mid-2024.	TRUE; This is green innovation because it significantly reduces energy consumption and improves reliability while preparing the plant for future green ammonia production, which supports environmental sustainability goals.	TRUE; This is a business innovation as it involves a new or improved product (the ammonia converter cartridge) that significantly differs from previous products and is being introduced into the market.	FALSE; While the new ammonia converter cartridge contributes to improved processes, it is not categorized as a green product itself since it is a component rather than a final good or service designed specifically to reduce environmental impact throughout its life cycle.	TRUE; This is a green process because the implementation of the new cartridge aims to minimize environmental impacts by reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency in the ammonia production process.	thyssenkrupp Uhde	thyssenkrupp Uhde GmbH	uhde ammonia converter cartridge	Likely NAICS Codes: 325311 - Nitrogenous Fertilizer Manufacturing, 333611 - Turbine and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing, 325120 - Industrial Gas Manufacturing, 324110 - Petroleum Refineries	FALSE; The article does not provide any misleading statements about environmental benefits and appears to be focused on genuine improvements aimed at enhancing sustainability in ammonia production.	1903
