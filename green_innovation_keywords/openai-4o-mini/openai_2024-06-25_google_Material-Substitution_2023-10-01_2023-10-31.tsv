The amendments include targets for reusable packaging and restrictions on single-use packaging in restaurants, alongside a quota for recycled content in new products. Despite opposition and some dilution of the original proposal, the committee's decision is seen as a step towards systemic solutions for reducing packaging waste. Concerns were raised about loopholes that could undermine the effectiveness of recycled content targets.
