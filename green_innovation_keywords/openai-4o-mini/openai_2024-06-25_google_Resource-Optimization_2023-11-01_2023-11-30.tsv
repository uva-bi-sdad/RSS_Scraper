Spatio-temporal divergence and influencing factors of agritourism integration development in Xinjiang, China ... - Nature.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMy00NjgwNi010gEA?oc=5	The article discusses the construction of a dynamic econometric model to explore factors influencing the integration of agritourism and agriculture in Xinjiang from 2009 to 2018, focusing on variables such as service capacity, human capital, government support, residents' consumption levels, industrial base, and market supply. It evaluates the impact of these factors on the coupling coordination degree, revealing both positive and negative influences, particularly emphasizing the role of human capital and the limitations of government support. The regression analysis indicates challenges faced due to transportation and infrastructure lagging behind the required levels for effective tourism integration. Overall, the empirical findings suggest that improving certain factors can enhance the agri-tourism integration process in Xinjiang.
