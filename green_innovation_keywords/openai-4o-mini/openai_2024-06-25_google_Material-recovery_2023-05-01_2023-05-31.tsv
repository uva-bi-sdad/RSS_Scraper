These bins, designed for easy waste separation, aim to improve recycling rates, as coffee cups represent a significant waste stream. The initiative has resulted in an increased recycling rate for TPE, which has been working with a waste solutions company to implement these bins and engage customers in sustainable practices. The company aims to recover more coffee cups through these dedicated recycling routes.	TRUE - This is green innovation because it contributes to environmental sustainability by providing a system for recycling single-use coffee cups, which are typically difficult to process and often end up in incinerators.	TRUE - This is a business innovation because it involves the introduction of a new service (coffee cup recycling bins) that significantly differs from the previous methods of waste management at the stations.	FALSE - This is not a green product as the article does not describe a specific good or service that meets the definition of a green product, but rather an initiative to improve recycling.	TRUE - This is a green process as it involves implementing a recycling system aimed at minimizing environmental impacts and promoting sustainability by properly separating waste materials.
