Managing the product and the process record: Benefits of using product life cycle	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5ceaeb1b458b9719e8385f620591&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.isa.org%2fintech-home%2f2017%2fjanuary-february%2ffeatures%2fmanaging-the-product-and-the-process-record-benefi&c=15607788477569663833&mkt=en-us	The article discusses the integration of product life-cycle management (PLM) with manufacturing process management (MPM) to improve efficiencies in test and assembly processes, reduce costs, and enhance data accuracy. It emphasizes the importance of centralized access to product information and how managing routing information within a PLM system can streamline operations and minimize errors. The benefits include eliminating paper processes, providing visual aids for assembly, and using real-time data to manage material consumption. Overall, this leads to reduced manufacturing costs and improved product development timelines.	TRUE, because the integration of PLM with manufacturing processes reduces waste, conserves resources, and minimizes environmental impacts by eliminating paper-based processes and enhancing quality management.	TRUE, as the innovations described significantly improve the product development process through enhanced efficiencies in manufacturing and product management.	FALSE, the article does not discuss a specific good or service that meets the criteria for a green product.	TRUE, the integration of PLM and MPM is a green process because it uses technology to streamline operations, reducing waste and energy consumption.	company not identified	company not identified	product life-cycle management (PLM) integration with manufacturing process management (MPM)	Likely NAICS Codes: 334614 - Software and Other Prerecorded Compact Disc, Tape, and Record Reproducing; 334499 - All Other Manufacturing; 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services; 511210 - Software Publishers.
