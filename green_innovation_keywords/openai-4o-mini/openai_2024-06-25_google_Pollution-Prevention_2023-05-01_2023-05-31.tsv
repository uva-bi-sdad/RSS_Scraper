Nurdles, which are small plastic pellets packed with chemicals, pose risks to marine life as they can be mistaken for food and break down into microplastics. The recommendations aim to prevent future environmental harm stemming from logistic failures involving these materials.	TRUE - The article discusses stowage recommendations for nurdles, which aim to minimize environmental impact and prevent marine pollution, thereby supporting sustainability goals.	FALSE - The article does not discuss a specific product or business process that significantly differs from prior offerings or has been brought to market by a firm.	FALSE - While nurdles are used to create plastic products, they themselves do not meet the definition of a green product as they can create significant environmental harm.	TRUE - The stowage recommendations can be viewed as a green process aimed at reducing environmental impacts related to the handling and transportation of plastic pellets.	company not identified	company not identified	Stowage recommendations for nurdles	Likely NAICS Codes: 325211 - Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing; 488320 - Marine Cargo Handling; 483111 - Deep Sea Freight Transportation; 562920 - Materials Recovery Facilities	FALSE - The article provides factual information about new safety recommendations rather than making misleading claims about environmental benefits.	1399

The amendments allow for activities currently without feasible low-carbon alternatives to be considered Taxonomy eligible. This includes aircraft manufacturing with a focus on upgrading for environmental compliance despite ongoing controversy surrounding the potential long-term impact of such inclusions. The new criteria are set to apply from January 1, 2024, requiring entities to report from that date.	TRUE - The amendments focus on transitioning to lower carbon alternatives in transport, aligning with green innovation goals of reducing negative environmental externalities.	TRUE - The introduction of new criteria for sustainable transport activities represents a significant change in business processes aimed at mitigating climate change.	FALSE - The article discusses broad regulatory changes rather than a specific good or service designed to reduce environmental impact.	FALSE - While it mentions processes in relation to sustainable transport, it does not specify a particular method or technique that qualifies under the definition of a green process.	company not identified	company not identified	product or process not identified	Likely NAICS Codes: 336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing, 336412 - Helicopter Manufacturing, 486110 - Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction, 926150 - Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs	FALSE - The article presents amendments aimed at genuine environmental improvement and does not seem to misrepresent the environmental benefits of the activities discussed.	1664
