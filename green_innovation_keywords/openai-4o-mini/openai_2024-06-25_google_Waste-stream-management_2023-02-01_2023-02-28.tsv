Researchers use superheated steam to sanitize dry food manufacturing plants - Food Safety News	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RzYWZldHluZXdzLmNvbS8_cD0yMjQwOTTSAQA?oc=5	Researchers at Cornell University are developing a new sanitation tool using superheated dry steam to eliminate pathogens in dry food processing plants, a significant advancement for food safety. This innovation is particularly relevant for the milk powder and powdered infant formula industry, which has faced serious contamination issues. The research aims to establish best practices that reduce the need for water and sanitizers, aligning with sustainability goals. Funded by a $400,000 grant from the Center for Produce Safety, the project highlights the importance of maintaining safe processing environments for dry foods.	TRUE: This innovation reduces the demand on water and sanitizers in food manufacturing, aligning with sustainability goals and minimizing environmental impacts during food processing.	TRUE: The development of a new sanitation method with superheated steam qualifies as a business innovation as it significantly differs from conventional cleaning processes in food manufacturing.	FALSE: The article does not describe a specific good or service that meets the definition of a green product, as it focuses on a process instead.	TRUE: The use of superheated steam for sanitation in food processing is a green process as it minimizes environmental impacts by conserving water and avoiding harmful substances.	company not identified	company not identified	superheated dry steam	[{'code': '311', 'category': 'Food Manufacturing'}, {'code': '3115', 'category': 'Dairy Product Manufacturing'}, {'code': '3119', 'category': 'Other Food Manufacturing'}, {'code': '541712', 'category': 'Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences'}]	FALSE: The article does not imply any misleading claims about environmental benefits; it presents a genuine research initiative aimed at improving food safety and sustainability.	2070
