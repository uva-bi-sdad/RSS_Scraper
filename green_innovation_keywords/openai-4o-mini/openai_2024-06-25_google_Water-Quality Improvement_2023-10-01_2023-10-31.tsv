farming Farmers warn of 'welfare crisis' as new, stricter stocking rates confirmed - Irish Examiner	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL2Zhcm1pbmcvYXJpZC00MTI0MDA3Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5	Dairy farmers in Ireland are concerned about new stricter nitrates limits that may force them to cull heavily pregnant cows, potentially leading to an animal welfare crisis. The Department of Agriculture clarified the new stocking rates, resulting in some land being removed from the 220kg/ha limit. Farmers are calling for immediate clarification on their status and support options due to the approaching compliance deadline. Industry representatives have emphasized the need for a clear national water quality improvement plan that acknowledges farmers' efforts in improving water quality.
