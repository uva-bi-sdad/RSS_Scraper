Two Direct-Air Carbon Removal Projects Set for $1.1B DOE Push - Engineering News-Record	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTY5MzktdHdvLWRpcmVjdC1haXItY2FyYm9uLXJlbW92YWwtcHJvamVjdHMtc2V0LWZvci0xMWItZG9lLXB1c2jSAQA?oc=5	The article discusses two large-scale direct-air carbon removal projects on the Gulf Coast that are set to receive $1.1 billion in federal funding to help capture CO2 from the atmosphere. Occidental Petroleum and Battelle are the key players in developing these facilities, which will make use of renewable energy and aim to store carbon permanently underground. The projects are positioned as significant steps towards achieving net-zero emissions, but they also face scrutiny regarding the feasibility and energy demands of direct air capture technology. Overall, the funding is part of a broader federal initiative aimed at scaling carbon removal technology in the U.S.	TRUE - The projects focus on direct-air carbon capture and are designed to reduce CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, contributing to environmental sustainability and the goal of net-zero emissions.	TRUE - The development of new direct-air carbon capture facilities represents a significant improvement over previous technologies and is a new business process introduced by the involved firms.	FALSE - While the projects involve technology that aims to reduce environmental impact, they do not fit the definition of a green product as they are focused on processes rather than tangible goods.	TRUE - The methods of capturing and storing carbon dioxide through direct-air capture represent a process that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability.
