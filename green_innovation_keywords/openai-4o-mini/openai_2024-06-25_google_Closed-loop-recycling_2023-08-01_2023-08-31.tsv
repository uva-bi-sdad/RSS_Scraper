Recycling of Polyurethane Foam Takes a Step Forward - AZoCleantech	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b2NsZWFudGVjaC5jb20vbmV3cy5hc3B4P25ld3NJRD0zMzgwMtIBAA?oc=5	Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a cost-effective method for recycling flexible foam polyurethane from old mattresses, extracting its main component, polyol, for reuse. This method enables the recycling of polyol repeatedly, significantly reducing landfill waste and promoting a circular economy for polyurethane products. The innovation addresses the challenges associated with polyurethane disposal and aims to control waste streams in the industry.	TRUE - This innovation reduces environmental impacts by recycling polyurethane foam, thereby decreasing landfill waste and promoting sustainability through a circular economy.	TRUE - The innovation involves a new method of recycling that significantly differs from previous approaches and has been demonstrated in collaboration with industry partners.	TRUE - The recycled polyol used in new mattresses is designed to minimize environmental impact and support sustainability through reduced waste.	TRUE - The solvolysis process developed by Aarhus University reduces waste and conserves natural resources by allowing for the repeated extraction of polyol from polyurethane foam.

Old Mattresses Made New: Simple Chemistry Can Recycle Polyurethane - Technology Networks	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNobm9sb2d5bmV0d29ya3MuY29tL2FwcGxpZWQtc2NpZW5jZXMvbmV3cy9vbGQtbWF0dHJlc3Nlcy1tYWRlLW5ldy1zaW1wbGUtY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWNhbi1yZWN5Y2xlLXBvbHl1cmV0aGFuZS0zNzcxMjPSAQA?oc=5	Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a method for breaking down flexible foam polyurethane (PU) into its original components, allowing for recycling into new materials and significantly reducing landfill waste. This technique, called solvolysis, has been proven effective by extracting polyol from foam mattresses and replacing a sizable portion of new materials with recycled content. The innovation moves towards a circular economy for PU while highlighting the need for better waste stream management. The findings were published in ACS Sustainable Chem & Eng.	TRUE: This is green innovation because it contributes to environmental sustainability by recycling polyurethane material, reducing landfill waste, and promoting a circular economy.	TRUE: This is a business innovation as it involves a new process for breaking down and reusing polyurethane, which differs significantly from previous methods and has been introduced to the market.	TRUE: The recycled polyol used in the new piece of mattress demonstrates it is a green product, as it is designed to reduce environmental impact by utilizing recycled materials.	TRUE: The solvolysis method described in the article is a green process as it minimizes environmental impacts by breaking down PU waste for recycling and promoting sustainability.
