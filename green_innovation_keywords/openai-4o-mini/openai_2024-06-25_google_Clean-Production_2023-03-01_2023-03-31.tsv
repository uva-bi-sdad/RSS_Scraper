Forever chemicals PFAS won't be in office supplies from 3M - Inhabitat	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5oYWJpdGF0LmNvbS9mb3JldmVyLWNoZW1pY2Fscy1wZmFzLXdvbnQtYmUtaW4tb2ZmaWNlLXN1cHBsaWVzLWZyb20tM20v0gEA?oc=5	3M has announced it will cease manufacturing PFAS, known as 'forever chemicals', by 2025 due to their harmful environmental and health effects. This decision is influenced by increasing regulations and growing public pressure regarding the dangers of these chemicals. The article discusses the prevalence of PFAS in various products and highlights the need for safer alternatives and proper management of contaminated sites. The move by 3M sets an important precedent for the chemical industry to adopt greener practices.	TRUE, because the cessation of PFAS production represents a significant step towards reducing harmful environmental impacts associated with forever chemicals, therefore contributing to environmental sustainability.	TRUE, since 3M's decision to stop manufacturing PFAS chemicals marks a significant change from its previous business processes that involved the production of these hazardous substances.	FALSE, as the article does not specify a particular product that fits the definition of a green product. It discusses the discontinuation of harmful chemicals rather than introducing a product designed to reduce environmental impact.	TRUE, because the decision to discontinue the production of PFAS chemicals represents a shift towards adopting greener processes that minimize environmental harm and promote sustainability.	3M	3M Company	PFAS discontinuation	Likely NAICS Codes: 3251 - Basic Chemical Manufacturing, 3252 - Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing, 3253 - Pesticide, Fertilizer, and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing, 3256 - Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toilet Preparation Manufacturing.	FALSE, as the article does not suggest that 3M's announcement is an attempt to mislead consumers regarding the environmental benefits of their products; rather, it indicates a genuine shift in their practices towards reducing harmful environmental impacts.	3201
