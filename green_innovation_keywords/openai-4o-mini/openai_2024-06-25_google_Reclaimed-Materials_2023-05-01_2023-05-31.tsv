World tour for model boat inspiring citizen science against environmental pollution - Northumbria University	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLm5vcnRodW1icmlhLmFjLnVrL3ByZXNzcmVsZWFzZXMvd29ybGQtdG91ci1mb3ItbW9kZWwtYm9hdC1pbnNwaXJpbmctY2l0aXplbi1zY2llbmNlLWFnYWluc3QtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1wb2xsdXRpb24tMzI0OTkxN9IBAA?oc=5	The Flipflopi project has created a model sailing boat made entirely from recycled plastics, aiming to combat single-use plastics and inspire communities globally. Supported by Northumbria University, the project recovered 135 tonnes of plastics and emphasizes cross-collaboration to address environmental pollution. The exhibition in Portugal showcases the versatility of plastics and encourages innovative solutions to reduce their consumption. The team promotes education and skill-sharing to further combat the problem of ocean plastics and to foster a circular economy.	TRUE: This is green innovation because it involves creating a product (the sailing boat) from recycled materials and promotes environmental sustainability by advocating against plastic pollution.	TRUE: This is a business innovation as it involves the development and introduction of a new product (the recycled plastic sailing boat) that significantly differs from previous products and contributes to a new business process relating to sustainable practices.	TRUE: This is a green product because the sailing boat is made from 100% recycled plastic, designed to reduce environmental impact throughout its lifecycle.	TRUE: This is a green process since it incorporates methods that minimize waste by recycling materials and using them creatively to build new products.
