A Supreme Court Ruling May Make It Harder for Government Agencies to Use Good Science	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.scientificamerican.com%2farticle%2fsupreme-courts-chevron-deference-decision-could-make-science-based%2f&c=10367798155574025504&mkt=en-us	The Supreme Court is considering changes to Chevron deference, a legal principle that allows federal agencies to interpret congressional statutes. The outcome could significantly impact medication approval, pollution regulation, and other regulatory processes by increasing judicial scrutiny of agency actions. Legal experts express concerns that weakening this principle may hinder agencies’ abilities to address pressing issues like climate change, as it blurs the lines of agency authority and could lead to more litigation against federal entities. The ruling could lead to a cautious approach from agencies, impeding their capacity to act on scientific findings related to public health and environmental protection.
