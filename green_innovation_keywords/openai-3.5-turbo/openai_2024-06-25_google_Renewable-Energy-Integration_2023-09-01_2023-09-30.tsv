India approves viability gap funding scheme for battery storage development - pv magazine International	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzA3L2luZGlhLWFwcHJvdmVzLXZpYWJpbGl0eS1nYXAtZnVuZGluZy1zY2hlbWUtZm9yLWJhdHRlcnktc3RvcmFnZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5	The Union Cabinet of India has approved a VGF scheme for BESS development, aiming to develop 4 GWh of BESS projects by 2030-31 with financial support up to 40% of the project's capital cost. This is expected to reduce the cost of battery storage systems and increase their viability, targeting a levelized cost of storage of INR 5.50/kWh to INR 6.60/kWh.	TRUE - The approved VGF scheme for BESS development aligns with environmental sustainability goals by promoting renewable energy integration into the electricity grid, reducing wastage, and optimizing transmission network utilization.	TRUE - The introduction of a new financial support scheme for BESS projects represents a business innovation by offering a different approach to funding and developing energy storage projects.	FALSE - The text does not focus on a specific tangible product but rather on a financial support scheme for BESS projects.
