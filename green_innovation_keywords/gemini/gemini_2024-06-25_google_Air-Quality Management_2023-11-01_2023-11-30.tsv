Ireland's new national air quality forecast goes live today - TheJournal.ie	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpvdXJuYWwuaWUvZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWFnZW5jeS1haXItcXVhbGl0eS1mb3JlY2FzdC02MjEzMjUyLU5vdjIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has launched a national air quality forecast online, which will enable people to plan their outdoor activities “in order to reduce potential exposure to poor air quality”. The forecast will allow members of the public to read maps that show a predicted daily air quality in their area for up to three days. The maps are based on the Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH), a scale from 1 to 10 which indicates what the air quality currently is in the nearest station and whether or not it might affect someone’s health.
