Siemens expands sustainable MV switchgear range - Your Gateway to Power Transmission & Distribution - T&D India	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRuZGluZGlhLmNvbS9zaWVtZW5zLWV4cGFuZHMtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYW5kLWRpZ2l0YWwtbXYtc3dpdGNoZ2Vhci1yYW5nZS_SAQA?oc=5	Siemens has expanded its range of sustainable and digital medium-voltage switchgear to support the decarbonization of power grids. The new switchgear uses Clean Air, a natural-origin gas with a low global warming potential, and vacuum-interrupter technology, which helps to reduce the carbon footprint. The switchgear also incorporates software from Siemens Xcelerator, which enables predictive maintenance and reduces downtime.	TRUE, The switchgear uses Clean Air, a natural-origin gas with a low global warming potential, which helps to reduce the carbon footprint.
