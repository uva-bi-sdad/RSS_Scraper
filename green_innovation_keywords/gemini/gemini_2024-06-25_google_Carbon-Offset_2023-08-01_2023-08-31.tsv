Carbon market gives clearer rules on offsetting - FoodNavigator.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RuYXZpZ2F0b3IuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wOC8xMS9DYXJib24tbWFya2V0LWdpdmVzLWNsZWFyZXItcnVsZXMtb24tb2Zmc2V0dGluZ9IBAA?oc=5	Amid rising concerns over greenwashing and non-transparent carbon markets, several food companies are steering away from carbon offsets and focusing on reducing emissions within their own operations. Voluntary carbon markets are seeking to instill confidence in the use of carbon offsets by rolling out quality standards for carbon credit projects, including those pertaining to emissions impact, program governance and sustainable development impacts. A significant shift in the voluntary carbon market is encouraging companies to adopt a 'climate contribution' approach, treating carbon credits as a means of addressing global climate issues rather than a compensation for unabated emissions.

Two Direct-Air Carbon Removal Projects Set for $1.1B DOE Push - Engineering News-Record	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTY5MzktdHdvLWRpcmVjdC1haXItY2FyYm9uLXJlbW92YWwtcHJvamVjdHMtc2V0LWZvci0xMWItZG9lLXB1c2jSAQA?oc=5	The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it will provide $1.1 billion in funding to two commercial-scale direct-air carbon removal (DAC) demonstration hubs on the Gulf Coast. The hubs, to be built by Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Battelle, will each have the capacity to remove up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year. The projects are part of the DOE's goal to develop a domestic industry to scour carbon emissions from the atmosphere and reach a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.	TRUE. The DAC technology removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which contributes to environmental sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.	TRUE. The DAC technology is a new and improved business process that differs significantly from previous methods of carbon capture and storage.	TRUE. The DAC technology is a green product because it reduces negative environmental externalities by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.	TRUE.
