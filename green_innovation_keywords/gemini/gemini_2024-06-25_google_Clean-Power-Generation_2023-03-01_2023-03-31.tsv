Discover the Top 10 Photovoltaic Trends in 2023 - StartUs Insights	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0dXMtaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL2lubm92YXRvcnMtZ3VpZGUvcGhvdG92b2x0YWljLXRyZW5kcy_SAQA?oc=5	A new report from Innovation Map outlines the top 10 global photovoltaic (PV) trends for 2023. These trends include the use of high-performance PV materials, solar resource assessment, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, solar-as-a-service, sustainable photovoltaics, and more. The report highlights 20 promising PV startups and their innovative solutions that improve asset maintenance, performance, and sustainability.	TRUE, the article discusses several green innovations, such as high-performance PV materials, sustainable photovoltaics, and solar-as-a-service, that contribute to environmental sustainability goals.	TRUE, the article discusses several business innovations, such as AI-powered solar power forecasts, robotic solar panel cleaning systems, and blockchain-based platforms for PV management, that differ significantly from previous products or processes and have been introduced to the market.	TRUE, the article mentions sustainable photovoltaics as a trend in the industry, which is defined in the context as products designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces their environmental impact throughout their life cycle.	TRUE, the article mentions solar-as-a-service as a trend in the industry, which is defined in the context as a method or technique in manufacturing, production, or any other operational activity that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability.	Innovation Map	Innovation Map	The article discusses several products and processes, such as AI-powered solar power forecasts, robotic solar panel cleaning systems, and blockchain-based platforms for PV management, but does not name them.	['335999 - All Other Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing', '221330 - Solar Electric Power Generation', '541330 - Engineering Services', '541519 - Other Computer Related Services']	The article makes no mention of greenwashing, so I cannot determine that any of the innovations in the article are an example of greenwashing.
