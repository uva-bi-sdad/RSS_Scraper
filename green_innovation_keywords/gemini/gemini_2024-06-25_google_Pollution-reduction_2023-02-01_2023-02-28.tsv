Literacy rate impact on innovations and environmental pollution in China - Frontiers	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVyc2luLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4zMzg5L2ZlbnZzLjIwMjMuMTE1NDA1MtIBAA?oc=5	This study examines the impact of literacy rate and innovations on environmental pollution in China from 1990 to 2021. The study suggests that an increase in literacy rate leads to short- and long-term innovations, and that literacy has a positive effect in 1st to 4th quantile in the long run. Furthermore, innovation has a positive effect on environmental pollution. However, in the short run, the literacy rate has negative implications for environmental pollution.
