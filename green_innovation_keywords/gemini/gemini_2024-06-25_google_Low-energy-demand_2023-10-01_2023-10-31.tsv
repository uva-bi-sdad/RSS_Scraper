Australian Engineers Unveil Breakthrough in Concentrating Solar Thermodynamics - Microgrid Media	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbWljcm9ncmlkbWVkaWEuY29tL2F1c3RyYWxpYW4tZW5naW5lZXJzLXVudmVpbC1icmVha3Rocm91Z2gtaW4tY29uY2VudHJhdGluZy1zb2xhci10aGVybW9keW5hbWljcy_SAQA?oc=5	CSIRO engineers have developed ceramic particles that can withstand extreme temperatures, enabling more efficient and cost-effective Concentrating Solar Thermodynamics (CST) systems. This innovation could revolutionize the CST industry and make renewable energy more accessible for heavy industry in Australia. The ceramic particles can be heated to temperatures as high as 800Â°C, outperforming conventional heat transfer materials and allowing for longer thermal storage durations.
