Designing super-fast trimodal sponges using recycled polypropylene for organics cleanup | Scientific Reports - Nature.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMy00MTUwNi020gEA?oc=5	This article describes a new method of creating porous polymer thin films that can be used to selectively sorb oil from water. The method involves using a combination of preheating, rotation, and a cavity forming agent to create a trimodal structure with cavities, macro-voids, and micropores. The resulting sorbent films have a high porosity and tensile strength, and they can absorb up to 97 g/g of oil. They are also reusable and can be recycled using both mechanical squeezing and solvent washing techniques.	TRUE. The innovation is a new method of creating porous polymer thin films that can be used to selectively sorb oil from water. This innovation is green because it can help to clean up oil spills and reduce water pollution.	TRUE. The innovation is a new method of creating porous polymer thin films that can be used to selectively sorb oil from water. This innovation is a business innovation because it has the potential to be commercialized and used to solve a real-world problem.	TRUE. The innovation is a new method of creating porous polymer thin films that can be used to selectively sorb oil from water. This innovation results in a green product because it can help to clean up oil spills and reduce water pollution.	TRUE. The innovation is a new method of creating porous polymer thin films that can be used to selectively sorb oil from water. This innovation is a green process because it does not use any harmful chemicals or processes.	company not identified	company not identified	porous polymer thin films	['325211: Plastics Bag and Pouch Manufacturing', '325991: Custom Compounding of Purchased Resins', '325998: All Other Miscellaneous Plastics Product Manufacturing', '541711: Research and Development in Biotechnology']	This article does not describe an example of greenwashing.
