What should be done with the millions of used tyres? - Polytechnique Insights	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHl0ZWNobmlxdWUtaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL2VuL2NvbHVtbnMvZW5lcmd5L3doYXQtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWRvbmUtd2l0aC10aGUtbWlsbGlvbnMtb2YtdXNlZC10eXJlcy_SAQA?oc=5	The article discusses the collection and recycling of used tires in France. Over 532,000 tonnes of tires were collected in 2021, and 35.8% of those were recycled. The preferred method of recovery under the Environment Code is material recovery, but most end-of-life tires are recovered in the form of energy. However, tougher regulations and the development of new technologies, such as pyrolysis, are pushing the industry to increase the proportion of end-of-life tires recycled.	TRUE - The article mentions that pyrolysis is a green innovation that can be used to recycle used tires. Pyrolysis is a process that heats the tire to a very high temperature in the absence of oxygen, and it can recover a number of products, including carbon black, pyrolysis oil, steel-metal reinforcements, gas, and textiles.	TRUE - The article mentions that pyrolysis is a new technology that can be used to recycle used tires. This is a business innovation because it is a new way to recover materials from used tires.	FALSE - The article does not discuss any specific green products.	TRUE - The article mentions that pyrolysis is a green process because it can be used to recover materials from used tires and reduce waste.
