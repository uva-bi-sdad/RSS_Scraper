Exploring consumers' environmental ethical preferences in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle utilization for plant ... - Nature.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMy0zMDU1Ny000gEA?oc=5	This study investigates the impacts of food, production, and ecological safety pressures on perceived benefits and barriers, and the consumer acceptance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-dependent agricultural products in China. The research model is based on perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and PSR theory, which is often applied in environmental economics to reveal the interactions between humans and the environment. The authors find that food, production, and ecological safety pressures can have a positive influence on consumer acceptance of UAV-dependent agricultural products, and perceived benefits and barriers can also play a role in consumer acceptance of these products. Lay beliefs are used to moderate the effects of perceived benefits and barriers on consumer acceptance.

The impact of high-tech industrial agglomeration on China's green innovation efficiency: A spatial econometric analysis - Frontiers	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVyc2luLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4zMzg5L2ZlbnZzLjIwMjMuMTE2NzkxONIBAA?oc=5	This article discusses the importance of high-tech industrial agglomeration (HTIA) in assessing the quality of development, and how HTIA affects green innovation efficiency (GIE). The study finds that HTIA has a catalytic effect on GIE, and that there is a non-linear relationship between specialized agglomeration and GIE, while diversified agglomeration has a catalytic effect on GIE. The study suggests that policymakers should promote the clustering of high-tech industries in accordance with local conditions, and that they should strive for a balanced spatial distribution of high-tech enterprises and the coordinated development of industries across regions.
