Complimentary Recycling Strengthens Circular Plastics Economy - PlasticsToday	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXN0aWNzdG9kYXkuY29tL2FkdmFuY2VkLXJlY3ljbGluZy9jb21wbGltZW50YXJ5LXJlY3ljbGluZy1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1jaXJjdWxhci1wbGFzdGljcy1lY29ub2150gEA?oc=5	Governments are taking action to reduce plastic waste. Advanced recycling technologies can help, but collaboration between all parts of the waste management system is also needed to achieve a plastics circular economy. Chemical recycling is a promising technology that can process more of the plastics that cannot be recycled through established channels, but it needs to be combined with mechanical recycling and consumer education to be effective.	TRUE, because it contributes to environmental sustainability goals such as reducing plastic waste and conserving natural resources by developing a circular economy for plastics.	TRUE, because it introduces a new or improved product (advanced recycling technology) that differs significantly from the firm's previous products and processes and has been brought into use by the firm.	FALSE, because the article doesn't describe a specific product.	TRUE, because it describes a process (advanced recycling) that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability by reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and decreasing energy consumption.
