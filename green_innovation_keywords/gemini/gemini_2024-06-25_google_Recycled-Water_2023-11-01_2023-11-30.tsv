New lithium discovery highlights why we never run out of resources - Yield PRO magazine	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8veWllbGRwcm8uY29tLzIwMjMvMTEvbmV3LWxpdGhpdW0tZGlzY292ZXJ5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtd2h5LXdlLW5ldmVyLXJ1bi1vdXQtb2YtcmVzb3VyY2VzL9IBAA?oc=5	Technical forecasts of resource availability are biased towards doom and gloom because they underestimate the availability of resources and the rate of consumption. The discovery of a new lithium deposit is an example of how resources appear to stay barely ahead of short-term consumption needs, but in reality, businesses will search for new reserves when they start to run out. As resources become more scarce, prices rise, which forces consumers to economize and companies to create new substitutes.
