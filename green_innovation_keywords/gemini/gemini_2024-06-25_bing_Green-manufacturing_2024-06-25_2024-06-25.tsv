AGL plans huge solar recycling plant at retired coal site that Dutton wants for nuclear	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5cf6821442afb8e27627ca61156a&url=https%3a%2f%2freneweconomy.com.au%2fagl-plans-huge-solar-recycling-plant-at-retired-coal-site-that-dutton-wants-for-nuclear%2f&c=18341834456843321846&mkt=en-us	AGL Energy and Elecsome are collaborating to develop a feasibility study for a solar panel recycling facility at AGL's Hunter Energy Hub in New South Wales, Australia. The facility would have the capacity to recycle up to 500,000 residential and grid-scale solar panels annually, extracting valuable materials for reuse in the construction and manufacturing industries. This partnership is part of AGL's vision to transform the former Liddell coal-fired power station site into a renewable energy hub, which includes plans for battery recycling with Renewable Metals and solar panel manufacturing with SunDrive.	TRUE - The feasibility study for a solar panel recycling facility at AGL's Hunter Energy Hub in New South Wales, Australia, if successful, would contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing waste associated with solar panels and recovering valuable materials for reuse.	TRUE - The solar panel recycling facility would be a new or improved business process for AGL that differs significantly from their previous business processes and has the potential to create new jobs in the renewable energy sector.	TRUE - The feasibility study for a solar panel recycling facility at AGL's Hunter Energy Hub in New South Wales, Australia, if successful, would contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing waste associated with solar panels and recovering valuable materials for reuse.	TRUE - The solar panel recycling facility at AGL's Hunter Energy Hub in New South Wales, Australia, if successful, would use a new or improved process that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability by recycling solar panels and extracting valuable materials for reuse.
