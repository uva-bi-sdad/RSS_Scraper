Towards circular plastics within planetary boundaries - Nature.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxODkzLTAyMi0wMTA1NC050gEA?oc=5	This article assesses the planetary footprints of GHG mitigation strategies for the global production of plastics. The study finds that bio-based and CCU-based plastics have the potential to reduce the climate change impact of the plastics industry but may have trade-offs with other environmental impacts. The study also highlights the importance of recycling and the need to minimize the maximal transgression of the share of safe operating space of the plastics industry.	TRUE, because the study assesses the planetary footprints of GHG mitigation strategies for the global production of plastics, which is an example of green innovation.	NOT APPLICABLE, because the study does not describe a specific product or process that meets the criteria to be a business innovation.	TRUE, because the study assesses the planetary footprints of bio-based and CCU-based plastics, which are examples of green products.	TRUE, because the study assesses the planetary footprints of GHG mitigation strategies for the global production of plastics, which includes green processes such as recycling and chemical recycling.	company not identified	company not identified	product or process not identified	[]	NOT APPLICABLE, because the article does not describe a specific product or process innovation that is an example of greenwashing.
