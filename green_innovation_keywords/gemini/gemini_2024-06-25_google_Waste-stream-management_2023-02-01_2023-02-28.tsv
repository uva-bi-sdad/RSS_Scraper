Researchers use superheated steam to sanitize dry food manufacturing plants - Food Safety News	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RzYWZldHluZXdzLmNvbS8_cD0yMjQwOTTSAQA?oc=5	Researchers at Cornell University are developing a new tool to eliminate deadly pathogens in commercial dry food processing plants â€” superheated, dry steam. Superheated steam is heated beyond 212 degrees F to more than 250 degrees F, becomes invisible and acts like a hot gas, killing any pathogens and microbes, and leaves no moisture or condensation to harbor further pathogens. The research is relevant to milk powder and powdered infant formula, snack foods, spices, nuts, and nut butters, produce, as well as chocolate and other candies.	TRUE. The article describes a new process for using superheated dry steam to eliminate deadly pathogens in commercial dry food processing plants, which contributes to the environmental sustainability goal of reducing harmful substances and resource consumption.	TRUE. The new process for using superheated dry steam to eliminate deadly pathogens in commercial dry food processing plants is a new or improved business process that differs significantly from previous business processes and has been brought into use in the firm.	FALSE. The article does not describe a product.	TRUE. The article describes a new process for using superheated dry steam to eliminate deadly pathogens in commercial dry food processing plants that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability by reducing waste, conserving natural resources, decreasing energy consumption, and limiting the release of harmful substances into the environment.
