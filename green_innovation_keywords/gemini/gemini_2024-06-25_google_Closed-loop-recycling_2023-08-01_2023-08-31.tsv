How to ensure the PPWR actually enables more sustainable packaging - EURACTIV	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFjdGl2LmNvbS9zZWN0aW9uL2VuZXJneS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9vcGluaW9uL2hvdy10by1lbnN1cmUtdGhlLXBwd3ItYWN0dWFsbHktZW5hYmxlcy1tb3JlLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXBhY2thZ2luZy_SAQA?oc=5	The Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) aims to ensure that packaging in the EU is sustainable and circular. The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment (ACE) advocates for an open-loop approach to high-quality recycling, a transparent, technical and evidence-based approach for Design for Recycling (DfR) Guidelines, and no reuse targets for microbiological sensitive products, such as juice and milk. ACE argues that these measures are necessary to support continued innovation and sustainability leadership in the packaging industry.	TRUE, The article discusses the importance of sustainable packaging innovations, such as beverage cartons, and advocates for an open-loop approach to high-quality recycling and a transparent, technical and evidence-based approach for Design for Recycling (DfR) Guidelines.	TRUE, The article describes beverage cartons as a sustainable packaging solution that meets the criteria to be a business innovation, as it is a new or improved product that differs significantly from the firm's previous products and has been introduced on the market.	TRUE, The article describes beverage cartons as a green product, as they are designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces their environmental impact throughout their life cycle.	FALSE, The article does not describe a specific green process.

Recycling of Polyurethane Foam Takes a Step Forward - AZoCleantech	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b2NsZWFudGVjaC5jb20vbmV3cy5hc3B4P25ld3NJRD0zMzgwMtIBAA?oc=5	Scientists from Aarhus University have developed a new method to break down polyurethane (PU) plastic into its original components, which can then be recycled into new PU material instead of ending up in landfills or incinerators. The method can be used to address flexible foam polyurethane, and researchers have demonstrated that the method can be repeated many times, meaning that the polyol can be extracted and reused from polyurethane foam. This advances us one step closer to a circular economy for flexible PU foam.	TRUE, The innovation is a new method to break down polyurethane (PU) plastic into its original components, which can then be recycled into new PU material instead of ending up in landfills or incinerators.	TRUE, The innovation is a new method to break down polyurethane (PU) plastic into its original components, which can then be recycled into new PU material. This has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of PU production.
