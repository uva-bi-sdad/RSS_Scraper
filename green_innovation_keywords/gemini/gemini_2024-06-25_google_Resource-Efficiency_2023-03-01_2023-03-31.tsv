The extent to which circular economy principles have been applied in the design of medical devices for low-resource ... - Frontiers	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVyc2luLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4zMzg5L2Zyc3VzLjIwMjMuMTA3OTY4NdIBAA?oc=5	This article highlights the issue of non-functional and obsolete medical devices in low-resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa and proposes leveraging circular economy principles to address it. The study analyzes 29 scientific papers to identify the use of circular principles, such as durability, maintenance, repair, and upgrade. The findings indicate that while these principles are being considered in the design of medical devices for longevity, aspects related to recovery and recycling are not getting enough attention.
