Harnessing The Future Of Digital And Smart Manufacturing Of Medical Devices - Med Device Online	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGRldmljZW9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9jL2hhcm5lc3NpbmctdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLWFuZC1zbWFydC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLW9mLW1lZGljYWwtZGV2aWNlcy0wMDAx0gEA?oc=5	Digital and smart manufacturing are essential to maximize efficiency, improve productivity, and meet the needs of customers in the medical device manufacturing industry. Digitalization and smart manufacturing can improve end-user safety, expedite the expansion of a company’s product portfolio, and satisfy regulatory requirements. Smart manufacturing enhances digital manufacturing processes even further through the use of manufacturing execution systems (MESs), which connect live production information between multiple vendors and locations and integrate with a company’s existing equipment and business applications.	TRUE, the article promotes using AI, machine learning, and manufacturing execution systems (MESs) to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase regulatory compliance.	TRUE, the article promotes using digital and smart manufacturing, PLM systems, and MESs to improve efficiency, productivity, and regulatory compliance.	FALSE, the article does not describe a specific green product.	TRUE, the article promotes using smart manufacturing and MESs to improve efficiency, productivity, and regulatory compliance.	company not identified	company not identified	product or process not identified	['334510 - Medical Equipment Manufacturing', '511210 - Software Publishers', '541512 - Computer Systems Design Services', '541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services']	FALSE, the article does not describe an example of greenwashing.
