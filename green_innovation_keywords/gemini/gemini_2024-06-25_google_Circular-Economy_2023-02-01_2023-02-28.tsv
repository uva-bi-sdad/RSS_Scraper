Polymer expert turns waste into biodegradable materials to create a circular economy | Chemical Engineering - University of Waterloo	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdXdhdGVybG9vLmNhL2NoZW1pY2FsLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nL25ld3MvcG9seW1lci1leHBlcnQtdHVybnMtd2FzdGUtYmlvZGVncmFkYWJsZS1tYXRlcmlhbHMtY3JlYXRl0gEA?oc=5	Professor Tizazu Mekonnen of the University of Waterloo is working with CTK Bio Canada to create biodegradable polymers and plastics from plant-derived materials as well as plastic waste. Their work aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the feedstock competition with food production and bringing plastic sustainability. One application of their work is the creation of biodegradable cosmetic containers and packaging.	TRUE; the innovation is a new or improved product or process that reduces negative environmental externalities of human activity by creating biodegradable polymers from plant-derived materials as well as plastic waste to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.	TRUE; the innovation is a new product that differs significantly from the firm's previous products, biodegradable cosmetic containers and packaging.	TRUE; the innovation is any good or service that is designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces its environmental impact throughout its life cycle, such as their biodegradable cosmetic containers and packaging.	TRUE; the innovation is a new or improved business process that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability, such as their process for creating biodegradable polymers from plant-derived materials as well as plastic waste.
