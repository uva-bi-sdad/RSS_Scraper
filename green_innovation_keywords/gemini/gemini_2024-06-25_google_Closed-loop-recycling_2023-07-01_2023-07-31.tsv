Do deposits decrease beverage sales? Study says no - Plastics Recycling Update	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcmVzb3VyY2UtcmVjeWNsaW5nLmNvbS9wbGFzdGljcy8yMDIzLzA3LzE5L2RvLWRlcG9zaXRzLWRlY3JlYXNlLWJldmVyYWdlLXNhbGVzLXN0dWR5LXNheXMtbm8v0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXNvdXJjZS1yZWN5Y2xpbmcuY29tL3BsYXN0aWNzLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvZG8tZGVwb3NpdHMtZGVjcmVhc2UtYmV2ZXJhZ2Utc2FsZXMtc3R1ZHktc2F5cy1uby8?oc=5	A study of beverage sales trends over two decades found that deposit return systems (DRS) do not lead to decreased sales. The study also found that DRS significantly increase container recycling rates, making them the most effective means of obtaining more clean, high-quality materials for manufacturing new products.	TRUE, DRS significantly increase container recycling rates, making them the most effective means of obtaining more clean, high-quality materials for manufacturing new products.	TRUE, DRS can create savings in the form of reduced extended producer responsibility expenses in Europe and Canada and lower costs for municipalities and taxpayers.	FALSE, the article is about deposit return systems and not a specific product.	TRUE, DRS is a method or technique in manufacturing, production, or any other operational activity that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability.

Explore the 10 Leading Circular Economy Examples in 2024 - StartUs Insights	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0dXMtaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL2lubm92YXRvcnMtZ3VpZGUvY2lyY3VsYXItZWNvbm9teS1leGFtcGxlcy_SAQA?oc=5	The circular economy is a sustainable alternative to the traditional linear economy, which is based on the 'take, make, and dispose' model. It encompasses a broad spectrum of practices to extend product life cycles, maximize resource efficiency, and promote reuse, repair, and recycling. This article presents examples of the circular economy in action across different industries, including compostable materials, sustainable packages, zero-carbon food waste management, and more.	TRUE. The article describes multiple examples of green innovations, which are innovations that contribute to environmental sustainability goals, such as decarbonisation, reducing or replacing harmful substances, reducing resource consumption, nature and wildlife conservation, or the protection of biological systems.	TRUE. The article describes multiple examples of business innovations, which are defined as a new or improved product or business process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the firm's previous products or business processes and that has been introduced on the market or brought into use by the firm.	TRUE. The article describes multiple examples of green products, which are products that are designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces their environmental impact throughout their life cycle.	TRUE. The article describes multiple examples of green processes, which are methods or techniques in manufacturing, production, or any other operational activity that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability.

Finat reveals whitepaper on self-adhesive labels - Labels and Labeling	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHA6Ly93d3cubGFiZWxzYW5kbGFiZWxpbmcuY29tL2V1cm9wZS9ldXJvcGUvbmV3cy9hc3NvY2lhdGlvbnMtYW5kLWV2ZW50cy9maW5hdC1yZXZlYWxzLXdoaXRlcGFwZXItc2VsZi1hZGhlc2l2ZS1sYWJlbHPSAQA?oc=5	This article discusses the role of self-adhesive labels in PET recycling. It highlights the importance of using self-adhesive labels that are designed to release from the PET container in the washing step of the recycling process, as this results in clean PET flakes that enable closed-loop recycling. The article encourages producers of packaged goods to critically assess the overall recyclability of their packaging designs and to partner with converters and manufacturers of self-adhesive labels to ensure that the optimal label is used for a specific purpose, taking the recycling into account.	TRUE. The article describes a solution to increase the quantity and quality of recycled PET, thus enabling packaging circularity.	TRUE. The article describes wash-off self-adhesive labels as an existing solution to increase the quantity and quality of recycled PET.	TRUE. The article describes wash-off self-adhesive labels as a product that is designed to release from the PET container in the washing step of the recycling process, resulting in clean PET flakes that enable closed-loop recycling.	FALSE. The article does not describe a green process.
