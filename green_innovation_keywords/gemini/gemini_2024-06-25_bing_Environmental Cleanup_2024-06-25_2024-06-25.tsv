A Supreme Court Ruling May Make It Harder for Government Agencies to Use Good Science	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.scientificamerican.com%2farticle%2fsupreme-courts-chevron-deference-decision-could-make-science-based%2f&c=10367798155574025504&mkt=en-us	The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the Chevron deference doctrine, which gives federal agencies the authority to interpret ambiguous congressional statutes. A decision to overturn or weaken Chevron deference could have significant implications for science-based policymaking, especially in the areas of environmental and health regulation. Experts are concerned that it could lead to agencies being more cautious and less effective in responding to emerging threats.

The delusion of advanced plastic recycling using pyrolysis	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.salon.com%2f2024%2f06%2f23%2fthe-delusion-of-advanced-plastic-recycling-using-pyrolysis_partner%2f&c=16037556626559289742&mkt=en-us	Pyrolysis, a chemical recycling technology hailed as a cure for the plastic crisis, has been found to be incapable of curbing it. The process yields far less recycled plastic than traditional mechanical recycling, and relies heavily on fossil fuels. Despite industry claims of "advanced" recycling, the technology is not yet capable of delivering on its promises.	{'answer': 'TRUE', 'explanation': 'Pyrolysis is a technology that reduces negative environmental externalities of human activity by recycling plastic waste and turning it into new products, potentially reducing the need for new plastic production.'}	{'answer': 'TRUE', 'explanation': 'Pyrolysis is a new and improved business process for recycling plastic waste that differs significantly from previous recycling processes and has been brought into use in the firm.'}	{'answer': 'FALSE', 'explanation': 'The article does not describe a specific product that meets the criteria to be a green product.'}	{'answer': 'TRUE', 'explanation': 'Pyrolysis is a new and improved process for recycling plastic waste that minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability.'}	ExxonMobil	Exxon Mobil Corporation	Pyrolysis	['325998 - All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing', '562112 - Solid Waste Landfill', '326199 - All Other Plastic Product Manufacturing', '562219 - Other Nonhazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal']	The article does not provide enough information to determine whether pyrolysis is an example of greenwashing.
How the Recycling Symbol Duped People into Buying More Plastic	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.scientificamerican.com%2farticle%2fhow-the-recycling-symbol-duped-people-into-buying-more-plastic%2f&c=6129259725169411232&mkt=en-us	The recycling symbol has become ubiquitous, but its promise of rebirth has been broken.   Recycling rates have barely improved, and much of the plastic that is recycled is downcycled into lower-quality products that can't be recycled again.   Efforts are underway to restrict the use of the recycling symbol on products that are not actually recyclable, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful.	TRUE. The article describes the development of recycling programs, which are green innovations because they contribute to environmental sustainability goals by reducing waste and conserving natural resources.	TRUE. The article describes the development of curbside recycling programs, which are business innovations because they are new or improved business processes that differ significantly from the firm's previous business processes and that have been brought into use in the firm.	FALSE. The article does not describe any specific green products.	TRUE. The article describes the development of recycling programs, which are green processes because they minimize environmental impacts and promote sustainability by reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and decreasing energy consumption.	company not identified	company not identified	recycling programs	['562111 - Solid Waste Collection', '562112 - Hazardous Waste Collection', '562119 - Other Waste Collection', '562211 - Waste Treatment and Disposal']	FALSE.

Inside the Industry Push to Label Your Yogurt Cup ‘Recyclable’	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fgizmodo.com%2fgateway%2finside-the-industry-push-to-label-your-yogurt-cup-recy-1849652108&c=6882283067572922517&mkt=en-us	Many plastic products labeled with the recycling symbol are not actually recyclable, and the plastics industry has been accused of misleading the public about the environmental benefits of its products. One organization, How2Recycle, has developed its own labeling system for plastics, but environmental advocates argue that it is not rigorous enough and that it allows companies to greenwash their products. A new law in California will make it illegal for companies to use the chasing arrows symbol on products that are not actually being recycled.	TRUE, How2Recycle's labeling system is designed to help consumers identify which plastic products are actually recyclable, and it takes into account factors such as collection, sortation, reprocessing, and end markets.	FALSE, How2Recycle's labeling system is not a business innovation because it is not a new or improved product or business process.	FALSE, the article does not describe any specific green products.	FALSE, the article does not describe any specific green processes.
