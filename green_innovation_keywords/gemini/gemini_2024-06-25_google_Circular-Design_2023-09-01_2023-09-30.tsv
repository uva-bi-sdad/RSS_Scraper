10 Provocations for Circular Design - Metropolis Magazine	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm9wb2xpc21hZy5jb20vdmlld3BvaW50cy8xMC1wcm92b2NhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWNpcmN1bGFyLWRlc2lnbi_SAQA?oc=5	Many building materials are not currently recycled, reused, or remanufactured because of a lack of infrastructure, clear recycling streams, and cost to remanufacture. Retrofitting and renovation projects can sometimes extend the life of buildings, but they can also generate a lot of waste. Using biobased and biodegradable materials is not a perfect solution because we would need a lot of new composting infrastructure to handle them, and they can still be harmful to the environment if they end up in landfills or oceans. Ultimately, reducing consumption and waste is the best way to create a more sustainable built environment.
