Shining a new light on electric oven technology - BakingBusiness.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81OTk0NC1zaGluaW5nLWEtbmV3LWxpZ2h0LW9uLWVsZWN0cmljLW92ZW4tdGVjaG5vbG9nedIBAA?oc=5	Electric ovens are becoming popular in the baking industry due to their environmental and operational benefits. They offer two main advantages: they either minimize or eliminate carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, and they decrease energy consumption because only low or no fumes are emitted. Additionally, electric ovens generally need less exhaust due to the lack of products of combustion, which helps retain more heat in the bake chamber, further improving energy efficiency.
