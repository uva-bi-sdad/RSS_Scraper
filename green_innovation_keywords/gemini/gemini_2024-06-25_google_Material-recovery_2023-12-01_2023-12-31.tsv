5 Ways to Improve the Sustainability of Electronics - Electronic Design	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjdHJvbmljZGVzaWduLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMvZW1iZWRkZWQvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTI3OTMxMC92dHQtdGVjaG5pY2FsLXJlc2VhcmNoLWNlbnRyZS1vZi1maW5sYW5kLTUtd2F5cy10by1pbXByb3ZlLXRoZS1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1vZi1lbGVjdHJvbmljc9IBAA?oc=5	The electronics industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and move toward circularity. The article discusses five main areas that the industry needs to improve upon to achieve more sustainability: designing for circularity, using more sustainable raw materials, creating more efficient manufacturing techniques, and designing for sustainability for both the use and end-of-life phases. The article concludes that the electronics industry has several possibilities to decrease its environmental impact, and that it all starts at the design phase with the selection of layouts, materials, and manufacturing processes.	TRUE. The article focuses on green innovations in the electronics industry, particularly in the area of flexible electronics. The innovations discussed in the article include the use of more sustainable raw materials, such as bio-based substrates, and the development of more energy-efficient and material-efficient manufacturing techniques, such as additive printing methods.	TRUE. The article discusses several business innovations that have been developed to improve the sustainability of the electronics industry, such as new business models that focus on service-based models rather than product-based models, and the development of new products that are designed for circularity and can be easily recycled or remanufactured.	TRUE. The article discusses several green products that have been developed in the electronics industry, such as the VTT's new nanocellulose electrocardiogram (ECG) patch and smart labels printed on bio-based plastic substrate. These products are designed to be more sustainable throughout their lifecycle, from the use of more sustainable raw materials to the design of end-of-life solutions.	TRUE. The article discusses several green processes that have been developed in the electronics industry, such as the use of additive printing methods to create flexible electronic components and the development of new energy-harvesting capabilities, such as using organic photovoltaics (OPV). These processes are designed to reduce the environmental impact of the electronics industry, such as by reducing energy consumption and waste.

Sunshine Coast's new recycling plant now open - Council - Council Magazine	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY291bmNpbG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS5hdS9zdW5zaGluZS1jb2FzdHMtbmV3LXJlY3ljbGluZy1wbGFudC1ub3ctb3Blbi_SAQA?oc=5	The Sunshine Coast Council in Australia has opened a new, high-tech Nambour Material Recovery Facility. The facility is capable of sorting paper and cardboard at a 98% purity rate, which is the highest of any facility in Australia. The facility is expected to process approximately 60,000t of recyclable materials per year.	TRUE, the facility sorts paper and cardboard at a 98% purity rate, which will reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and promote the circular economy.	TRUE, the facility uses high-tech sorting equipment to achieve a 98% purity rate for paper and cardboard, which is a significant improvement over the previous facility.	TRUE, the facility sorts recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and aluminum, which can be used to make new products.	TRUE, the facility uses advanced sorting technology to separate recyclable materials with high accuracy, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and promoting the circular economy.

Getting it sorted: meet MuRF, our recycling wonder - OurSC	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vb3Vyc2MuY29tLmF1L2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2dldHRpbmctaXQtc29ydGVkLW1lZXQtbXVyZi1vdXItcmVjeWNsaW5nLXdvbmRlctIBAA?oc=5	A new "new breed” of recycling facility has opened on the Sunshine Coast in Australia. The facility, called MuRF, is designed to sort and separate recyclable waste to a high standard and supply desirable materials for industry. This will spur innovation within the private sector and create more ways to use recycled materials.	TRUE, The recycling facility uses advanced screening and sorting equipment to maximise the quantity and quality of recovered paper, cardboard, metals, plastic and glass.	TRUE, The recycling facility is a new and improved business process for one or more business functions that differs significantly from the firm’s previous business processes and that has been brought into use in the firm.	TRUE, The recycling facility will produce high-quality recycled materials that can be used to make new products.	TRUE, The recycling facility uses advanced screening and sorting equipment to maximise the quantity and quality of recovered paper, cardboard, metals, plastic and glass.
