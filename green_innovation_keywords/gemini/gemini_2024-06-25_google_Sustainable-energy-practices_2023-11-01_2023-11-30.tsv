This initiative is part of Spinneys' wider sustainability strategy, which includes a 'life cycle assessment' for all new packaging and product design.	TRUE. The rPET packaging reduces negative environmental externalities of human activity by using less water, energy, and fossil fuels than standard ‘virgin’ PET packaging.	TRUE. The rPET packaging is a new or improved product that differs significantly from Spinneys' previous packaging and has been introduced on the market.	TRUE. The rPET packaging is designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces its environmental impact throughout its life cycle.	FALSE. The article does not describe a process, only a product.
