Food City Stores in Tennessee to Become Hub for Advanced Plastics Recycling - Progressive Grocer	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVncm9jZXIuY29tL2Zvb2QtY2l0eS1zdG9yZXMtdGVubmVzc2VlLWJlY29tZS1odWItYWR2YW5jZWQtcGxhc3RpY3MtcmVjeWNsaW5n0gEA?oc=5	Food City and Eastman have partnered to bring plastic recycling to the Appalachian Highlands region through designated collection bins at three Food City stores. The collected plastic will be recycled at Eastman's new mixed-plastics processing facility, which is part of the largest material-to-material recycling facility in the world. This partnership is part of Eastman and Food City's commitment to advancing the circular economy and reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.	TRUE - The partnership between Food City and Eastman promotes the circular economy and reduces the environmental impact of plastic waste by recycling plastics that are typically difficult to recycle through Eastman's molecular recycling technology.	TRUE - Eastman's molecular recycling technology is a new and improved business process that differs significantly from the firm's previous business processes and reduces waste and conserves natural resources.	TRUE - The new materials created from the recycled plastics using Eastman's molecular recycling technology can be used in a variety of applications, reducing the need for virgin materials and promoting the circular economy.	TRUE - Eastman's molecular recycling technology breaks down plastic waste into its molecular building blocks, which are then used to create new high-performance plastics that are indistinguishable from virgin materials, reducing waste and conserving natural resources.

The company has launched a new range of "eco" products, including Ecopact, a type of concrete with a reduced CO2 footprint of at least 30%, and Ecoplanet, a green cement. Holcim is also experimenting with 3D printing of homes and bridges as a sustainable solution.	TRUE, Holcim's development of a new range of "eco" products, including Ecopact and Ecoplanet, is an example of green innovation because it contributes to environmental sustainability.	TRUE, Holcim's experimentation with 3D printing of homes and bridges is an example of business innovation because it is a new or improved business process that differs significantly from the firm's previous business processes and that has been brought into use in the firm.	TRUE, Holcim's Ecopact and Ecoplanet products are examples of green products because they are designed, manufactured, and used in a way that significantly reduces their environmental impact throughout their life cycle.	FALSE, The article does not describe any green processes.
