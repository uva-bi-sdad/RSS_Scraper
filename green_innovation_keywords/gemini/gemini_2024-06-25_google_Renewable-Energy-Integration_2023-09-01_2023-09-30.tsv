India approves viability gap funding scheme for battery storage development - pv magazine International	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzA3L2luZGlhLWFwcHJvdmVzLXZpYWJpbGl0eS1nYXAtZnVuZGluZy1zY2hlbWUtZm9yLWJhdHRlcnktc3RvcmFnZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5	The Indian government has approved a $1.13 billion scheme to develop 4 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) by 2030-31. The scheme aims to bring down the cost of BESS projects and increase their viability. BESS projects will allocate a minimum of 85% of their capacity to electricity distribution companies (discoms) to ensure consumer access to the scheme's benefits.	TRUE, because the scheme promotes the development of BESS projects, which contribute to environmental sustainability goals by enabling the integration of renewable energy into the electricity grid and reducing the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades.	TRUE, because the scheme introduces a new business model for BESS development, with financial support from the government in the form of VGF. This reduces the financial risk for developers and encourages private sector participation in BESS projects.	FALSE, because the article does not describe a specific green product.	FALSE, because the article does not describe a specific green process.	company not provided	company not identified	BESS projects	['221111 - Hydroelectric Power Generation', '221112 - Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation', '221113 - Nuclear Electric Power Generation', '221119 - Other Electric Power Generation']	FALSE, because the article does not describe a product or process innovation that is an example of greenwashing.
