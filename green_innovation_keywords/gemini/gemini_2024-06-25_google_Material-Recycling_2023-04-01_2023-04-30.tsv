FEATURE: "Horizontal recycling" tackling waste and giving plastics 2nd life - Kyodo News Plus	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2gua3lvZG9uZXdzLm5ldC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDQvNDU0Nzk2ZThmYmUzLWZlYXR1cmUtaG9yaXpvbnRhbC1yZWN5Y2xpbmctdGFja2xpbmctd2FzdGUtYW5kLWdpdmluZy1wbGFzdGljcy0ybmQtbGlmZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5	Kobe, Japan has launched the "Kobe Plastic Next" initiative to promote horizontal recycling, a process where used  products are recycled into raw materials to reproduce the original item. The initiative aims to reduce plastic waste by recycling used plastic bottles and other items into the same thing, without the need for new petroleum-derived materials.  A number of companies are participating in the project, including Kao Corp., Lion Corp., and Earth Corp.  Some of these companies are developing technology to crush collected refill packs into pellets, which are then converted into film and remade into refill packs.
