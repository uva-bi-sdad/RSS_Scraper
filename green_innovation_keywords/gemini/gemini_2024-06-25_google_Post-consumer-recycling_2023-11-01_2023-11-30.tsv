New technologies are emerging for recycling post-consumer textile waste, including mechanical and chemical recycling methods. Innovative companies are developing solutions to tackle the challenges of textile waste, such as low-quality recycled materials and inefficient waste collection systems.	TRUE. The article describes innovations in chemical recycling techniques to tackle waste from major fibres such as cellulosics and synthetics, which contributes to environmental sustainability goals such as reducing resource consumption and protecting biological systems.	TRUE. The article describes new or improved products and processes for recycling post-consumer textile waste, which differ significantly from previous methods and have been brought into use by companies.	TRUE. The article mentions various technologies for recycling post-consumer textile waste, such as mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, and Fibersort, which aim to transform waste into new, high-value textiles, and contribute to a circular economy.	TRUE. The article describes green processes for recycling post-consumer textile waste, such as mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, and enzymatic hydrolysis, which minimize environmental impacts and promote sustainability by reducing waste, conserving natural resources, decreasing energy consumption, and limiting the release of harmful substances into the environment.	company not identified	company not identified	mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, Fibersort	['313221 - Fabric Mills', '313311 - Broadwoven Fabric Mills', '313241 - Carpets and Rugs Mills', '313230 - Textile Finishing Mills']	FALSE. The article does not provide any evidence to suggest that the described product or process innovation is an example of greenwashing.
