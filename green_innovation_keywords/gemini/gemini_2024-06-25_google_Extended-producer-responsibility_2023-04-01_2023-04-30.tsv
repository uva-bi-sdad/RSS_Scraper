How yachts are disposed of – and why it's so environmentally toxic - Yachting Monthly	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhY2h0aW5nbW9udGhseS5jb20vc3BlY2lhbHMvaG93LXlhY2h0cy1hcmUtZGlzcG9zZWQtb2YtYW5kLXdoeS1pdHMtc28tZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbGx5LXRveGljLTkzNjQy0gEA?oc=5	The marine industry is facing a growing problem of how to dispose of redundant, environmentally toxic GRP-built craft. There are currently 6 million boats in the EU, 95% of which are made of GRP. Each year, 1-2% reach the end of their usable life, but only 2,000-3,000 are properly recycled. France's APER scheme is a world first which requires French manufacturers to pay an ‘eco-contribution’ for every new boat sold. That money is then supplemented by contributions from the national annual taxation on recreational craft, giving the scheme an operating budget to deal with recycling the legacy fleet, partially funded by the new fleet.	TRUE, The article describes the urgent need to find solutions to the problem of recycling materials from the legacy fleet of GRP-built craft and the steps being taken to design new boats using recyclable and bio-based materials that can be regrown on an annual basis and have low global warming potential.	TRUE, The article describes the APER (Advanced Polyester Recycling) scheme, which is a world-first example of extended producer responsibility (EPR), a legislative instrument that will significantly change how new products are designed, used, and treated at EOL (End of Life) in the future. EPR works on the simple premise that the original manufacturer retains responsibility for the item when it reaches its EOL.	TRUE, The article describes the use of flax-based laminate panels, which are made from a renewable resource, have low embodied carbon, and are biodegradable.	TRUE, The article describes a novel concept utilising flax-based laminate panels with embedded NFC (near field communication) chips to show the user or recycler the complete material content and process for recycling, including strain gauges and temperature sensors.

The compactors densify the plastics, making them easier to store, handle, and transport for recycling. This not only benefits farmers by providing a convenient and cost-effective way to manage plastic waste, but it also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills.	TRUE. The manual compactor system is a green innovation because it contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills.	FALSE.
