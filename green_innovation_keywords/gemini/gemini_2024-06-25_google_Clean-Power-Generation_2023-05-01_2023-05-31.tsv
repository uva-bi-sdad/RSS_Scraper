Arvato commissions first solar power plant in the USA - DC Velocity	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRjdmVsb2NpdHkuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzU3MzUxLWFydmF0by1jb21taXNzaW9ucy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1wbGFudC1pbi10aGUtdXNh0gEA?oc=5	The solar power plant has 1,160 solar panels and generates more than 800,000 kWh of green electricity per year, reducing electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions by 72 percent. It aligns with Bertelsmann's goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030. The project was financed through a Purchase Power Agreement (PPA), allowing for clean, low-cost electricity without upfront costs.	TRUE, the solar power plant contributes to environmental sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy.	FALSE, while the article describes a green innovation, it does not describe a business innovation.	TRUE, the solar power plant can be considered a green product as it is designed to significantly reduce environmental impact throughout its life cycle by using renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.	TRUE, the installation and operation of the solar power plant can be considered a green process as it minimizes environmental impacts by reducing energy consumption and promoting sustainability.

How Mattiq Uses Data and AI to Advance The Electrolyzer Technology, and Interview with Hydrogen Central - Hydrogen Central	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW4tY2VudHJhbC5jb20vaG93LW1hdHRpcS11c2VzLWRhdGEtYWktYWR2YW5jZS1lbGVjdHJvbHl6ZXItdGVjaG5vbG9neS1hbmQtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWNlbnRyYWwv0gEA?oc=5	Mattiq is a company that uses data and artificial intelligence to advance electrolyzer technology for the production of clean hydrogen. Their approach involves massively parallel experimentation and a closed-loop development pipeline to accelerate the discovery and deployment of new materials and processes. Mattiq is working with industrial partners to scale up their technology and bring it to market.	TRUE, Mattiq's technology contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing or eliminating the use of iridium in PEM electrolyzer catalysts, which is a critical step in making clean hydrogen production more scalable and cost-effective.	TRUE, Mattiq's technology is a new and improved business process for the design, development, and deployment of electrochemical systems. It streamlines the fragmented and siloed value chain for electrochemical process development and deployment, enabling faster and more efficient innovation.	TRUE, Mattiq's technology enables the production of clean hydrogen, which is a green product because it is produced using renewable feedstocks and electricity, rather than fossil fuel feedstocks and fossil fuel heat.	TRUE, Mattiq's technology is a green process because it minimizes environmental impacts and promotes sustainability in the production of clean hydrogen. It reduces or eliminates the use of iridium, which is a rare and expensive metal with a concentrated supply chain, and it uses massively parallel experimentation and a closed-loop development pipeline to optimize electrochemical systems and reduce waste.
