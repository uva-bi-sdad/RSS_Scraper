Recycling: Watch our video to find out what happens with recyclables in the blue bins - Miami University	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL21pYW1pb2guZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMi9yZWN5Y2xpbmctb24tY2FtcHVzLWhvdy1hcmUtcmVjeWNsYWJsZS1pdGVtcy1zb3J0ZWQtYW5kLXByb2Nlc3NlZC13YXRjaC1vdXItYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMtdmlkZW8uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5	Miami University makes recycling easy for its students by providing single-stream recycling bins. These bins are emptied and sent to Rumpke Waste & Recycling's material recovery center where the recyclable items are sorted using various methods.  The sorted materials are then baled and sold to Ohio companies to create new products.

Mapping the flat glass value-chain: a material flow analysis and energy balance of UK production - Glass on Web	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ2xhc3NvbndlYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXBwaW5nLWZsYXQtZ2xhc3MtdmFsdWUtY2hhaW4tbWF0ZXJpYWwtZmxvdy1hbmFseXNpcy1hbmQtZW5lcmd5LWJhbGFuY2UtdWstcHJvZHVjdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5	This study examines the environmental impact of using recycled glass (cullet) in new glass production, focusing on the UK flat glass sector. The study highlights the limited collection and reprocessing infrastructure for flat glass compared to container glass, resulting in missed environmental opportunities. By mapping material flows and evaluating energy balances, the study shows the potential for significant CO2 emission reductions if more flat glass is recycled into new glass products.
