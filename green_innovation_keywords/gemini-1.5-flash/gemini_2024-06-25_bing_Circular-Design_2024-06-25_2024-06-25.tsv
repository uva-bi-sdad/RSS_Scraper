Design issues concerning circular economy assessment methods at the product level: a comparative analysis through a case study of a mobile tiny house	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d1fa985464c91a7e8bc20539731&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cambridge.org%2fcore%2fjournals%2fdesign-science%2farticle%2fdesign-issues-concerning-circular-economy-assessment-methods-at-the-product-level-a-comparative-analysis-through-a-case-study-of-a-mobile-tiny-house%2f574CAB9C8D518B39FE49F37FB4B13040&c=527733255400871501&mkt=en-us	The article explores the circularity of a tiny house prototype built with sustainable materials like hemp bricks and spruce wood.  Six different circularity assessment tools were used to evaluate the prototype's environmental impact and the results suggest a moderate level of circularity. The researchers highlight the need to integrate circular economy principles throughout the design, manufacturing, and end-of-life stages of buildings to improve sustainability.
