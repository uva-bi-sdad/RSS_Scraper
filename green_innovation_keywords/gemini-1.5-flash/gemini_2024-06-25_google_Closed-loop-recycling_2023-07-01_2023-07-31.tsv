Do deposits decrease beverage sales? Study says no - Plastics Recycling Update	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcmVzb3VyY2UtcmVjeWNsaW5nLmNvbS9wbGFzdGljcy8yMDIzLzA3LzE5L2RvLWRlcG9zaXRzLWRlY3JlYXNlLWJldmVyYWdlLXNhbGVzLXN0dWR5LXNheXMtbm8v0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXNvdXJjZS1yZWN5Y2xpbmcuY29tL3BsYXN0aWNzLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvZG8tZGVwb3NpdHMtZGVjcmVhc2UtYmV2ZXJhZ2Utc2FsZXMtc3R1ZHktc2F5cy1uby8?oc=5	A new study examining the impact of deposit return systems (DRS) on beverage sales across the globe found no evidence that DRS negatively affect sales. The study, conducted by the Container Recycling Institute (CRI) and Reloop, analyzed data from 12 DRS markets over two decades and found sales fluctuations to be within normal variation and generally upward trending. The authors contend that DRS, which have been proven to significantly increase container recycling rates, are the most effective way to obtain clean materials for new products and offset costs through scrap sales revenues and unclaimed deposits.
