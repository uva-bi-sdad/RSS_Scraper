Digital Twins & CPG Manufacturing Transformation - Consumer Goods Technology	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY29uc3VtZXJnb29kcy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC10d2lucy1jcGctbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5	Digital twins are digital representations of physical systems, regularly updated with data from the physical system. They can simulate the behavior of the physical system, allowing for predictions of future behavior and improved decision-making. The convergence of data from the physical system, IoT connectivity, modeling methods, and at-scale computing has enabled the development of digital twins at scale in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry.

These chemicals, found in various products like non-stick cookware and waterproofing agents, have been linked to serious health issues and environmental contamination. This decision comes as regulations on PFAS tighten and alternatives are being developed, potentially paving the way for a cleaner future.
