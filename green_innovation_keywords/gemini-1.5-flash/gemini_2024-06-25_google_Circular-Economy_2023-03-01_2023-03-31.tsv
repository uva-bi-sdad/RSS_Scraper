Circular economy: the rule of the three R's... or seven? - CEPSA.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlcHNhLmNvbS9lbi9wbGFuZXQtZW5lcmd5LzIwMzAtZ29hbHMvY2lyY3VsYXItZWNvbm9teS10aGUtcnVsZS1vZi10aGUtcnPSAQA?oc=5	The circular economy model aims to reduce waste and resource consumption by reusing and recycling materials. Unlike the linear model of take, make, dispose, the circular economy strives to extend the life of products and use waste as raw material. This model involves minimizing the use of raw materials, water, and energy while promoting eco-design, repair, renewal, and waste recovery.

The extent to which circular economy principles have been applied in the design of medical devices for low-resource ... - Frontiers	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVyc2luLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4zMzg5L2Zyc3VzLjIwMjMuMTA3OTY4NdIBAA?oc=5	This article investigates the extent to which circular economy (CE) principles have been applied in the design of medical devices for low-resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  A systematic review of 29 scientific papers reveals that CE principles like durability, repair, maintenance, and upgrade are commonly used to ensure medical devices last longer in LRS, but principles for refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling are largely absent. The study highlights the need for research into these areas to prevent premature disposal of medical devices and promote sustainable healthcare in SSA.
