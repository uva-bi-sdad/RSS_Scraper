This facility is designed to process 25 tons of recyclables per hour and aims to divert 224 million pounds of recyclables annually, reducing the carbon footprint of waste management in the region. The Exchange is a $50 million investment and is expected to create over 50 new permanent jobs and generate significant economic benefits for the community.

The council claims that less than 3% of its waste is exported, but evidence suggests a significant portion ends up in an incinerator in Cardiff. The article highlights the council's lack of transparency regarding its waste management practices, particularly regarding a private company, Dyfed Recycling, that appears to be delivering waste to the council's site despite official denials.
