The partnership involves the placement of collection bins at Food City stores where customers can drop off their plastic waste, which will be processed at Eastman's new molecular recycling facility. This collaboration aims to reduce plastic waste and promote a circular economy by transforming plastic waste into valuable new materials.

How Holcim is reducing cement's climate impact - Fortune	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMDgvY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtY29uY3JldGUtY2VtZW50LWhvbGNpbS1mb3J0dW5lLTUwMC1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?oc=5	Holcim, the world's largest cement company, is undergoing a transformation to become more sustainable by developing low-emission cement and concrete. The company is facing pressure from climate activists and regulators to reduce its carbon footprint, and it has been making progress with its 'eco' range of products, which include recycled cement and concrete with a lower CO2 footprint. However, Holcim is still facing legal challenges from Pacific Islanders who are seeking damages for the company's role in climate change.	True	True	True	True	Holcim	Holcim Ltd.
