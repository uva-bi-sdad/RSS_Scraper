Towards circular plastics within planetary boundaries - Nature.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxODkzLTAyMi0wMTA1NC050gEA?oc=5	This study investigates the planetary footprints of various GHG mitigation strategies for global plastic production, including recycling, bio-based production, and production via Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU). By employing a bottom-up model covering over 90% of global plastic production, the study compares the planetary footprints of these strategies against fossil-based plastics, evaluating their impacts across multiple Earth-system processes within the planetary boundaries framework.
