These new indices, such as the '20% Green Bond' and '3x Green Bond Tilted' versions, offer investors the opportunity to achieve higher returns while aligning their investments with environmental sustainability goals. The indices can be further customized to meet specific needs, including business involvement exclusions, EU Taxonomy inputs, regulatory screens, and custom sector weightings.
