EU urged to ban 'carbon neutral' claims for food and drink: 'There's no such thing as a CO2 neutral banana' - FoodNavigator.com	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29kbmF2aWdhdG9yLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMvMDMvMTAvRVUtdXJnZWQtdG8tYmFuLWNhcmJvbi1uZXV0cmFsLWNsYWltcy1mb3ItZm9vZC1hbmQtZHJpbmstVGhlcmUtcy1uby1zdWNoLXRoaW5nLWFzLWEtQ08yLW5ldXRyYWwtYmFuYW5h0gEA?oc=5	The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) calls for a ban on carbon neutral claims on food and drink products, arguing that the claims are misleading and scientifically inaccurate.
