Recycling of Polyurethane Foam Takes a Step Forward - AZoCleantech	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b2NsZWFudGVjaC5jb20vbmV3cy5hc3B4P25ld3NJRD0zMzgwMtIBAA?oc=5	Researchers at Aarhus University have developed a method to recycle polyurethane foam, a common material in mattresses, by breaking it down into its original components. This method allows for the reuse of polyol, a key component of polyurethane, in new mattresses, significantly reducing the amount of waste going to landfills. The researchers have successfully demonstrated that this process can be repeated multiple times, creating a more circular approach to polyurethane foam production.

Old Mattresses Made New: Simple Chemistry Can Recycle Polyurethane - Technology Networks	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNobm9sb2d5bmV0d29ya3MuY29tL2FwcGxpZWQtc2NpZW5jZXMvbmV3cy9vbGQtbWF0dHJlc3Nlcy1tYWRlLW5ldy1zaW1wbGUtY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWNhbi1yZWN5Y2xlLXBvbHl1cmV0aGFuZS0zNzcxMjPSAQA?oc=5	Researchers at Aarhus University have developed a method called solvolysis to recycle flexible polyurethane foam, a common material used in mattresses. This process breaks down the foam into its original components, allowing for the extraction and reuse of polyol, a key component. This innovation has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of polyurethane waste that ends up in landfills.
