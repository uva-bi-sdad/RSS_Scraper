NIR test program reveals factors affecting flexible packaging sorting - Labels and Labeling	https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmxhYmVsc2FuZGxhYmVsaW5nLmNvbS9ldXJvcGUvbmV3cy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9uaXItdGVzdC1wcm9ncmFtLXJldmVhbHMtZmFjdG9ycy1hZmZlY3RpbmctZmxleGlibGUtcGFja2FnaW5nLXNvcnRpbmfSAQA?oc=5	CEFLEX, a consortium focused on flexible packaging, has conducted research to analyze how near-infrared (NIR) sorting technology identifies various materials within flexible packaging. The study examined 240 samples of different packaging structures to understand how NIR can differentiate and sort them for recycling, resulting in data that can be used to improve the design of flexible packaging for better recycling outcomes. This research will enhance CEFLEX's guidelines for designing flexible packaging with a circular economy in mind.
