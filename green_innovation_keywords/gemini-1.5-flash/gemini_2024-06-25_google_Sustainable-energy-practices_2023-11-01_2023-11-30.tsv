This move aligns with Spinneys' sustainability commitments and aims to reduce its environmental impact by using less energy and water while also diverting waste from landfills. The new packaging, containing 30% rPET, is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% and will be used for SpinneysFOOD's croissant and muffin ranges.
