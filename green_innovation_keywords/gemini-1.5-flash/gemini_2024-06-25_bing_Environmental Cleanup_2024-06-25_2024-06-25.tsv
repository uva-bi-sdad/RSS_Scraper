A Supreme Court Ruling May Make It Harder for Government Agencies to Use Good Science	http://www.bing.com/news/apiclick.aspx?ref=FexRss&aid=&tid=667b5d0442f647e8b1212f212eda2c14&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.scientificamerican.com%2farticle%2fsupreme-courts-chevron-deference-decision-could-make-science-based%2f&c=10367798155574025504&mkt=en-us	The Supreme Court is considering weakening Chevron deference, a legal principle allowing courts to defer to agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws. This could significantly impact how agencies like the FDA and EPA regulate various sectors, potentially slowing down medication approvals and making it harder for them to address issues like climate change. The court's decision will likely lead to more lawsuits challenging agency actions, making it more difficult for them to act effectively on scientific evidence and potentially hampering their ability to protect public health.

While the symbol has played a crucial role in promoting recycling, its widespread adoption on products that are not readily recyclable has created a misleading perception of progress toward sustainability.  The article argues for a shift away from a focus on recycling towards more effective solutions such as reducing consumption and developing reusable products.
