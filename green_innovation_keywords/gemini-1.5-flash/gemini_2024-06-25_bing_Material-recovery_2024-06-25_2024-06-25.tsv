The study tracked packages and found they often ended up in landfills, incinerators, or exported overseas, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the store drop-off system and raising concerns about greenwashing. While Amazon claims to be reducing plastic use and investing in better recycling infrastructure, the report suggests that the company's reliance on store drop-off labels may be misleading consumers.
